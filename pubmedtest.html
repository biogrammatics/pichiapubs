Here we present the isolation and characterization of a selective beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from the fungal strain of Aspergillus versicolor. The enzyme was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71H in a high yield and purified in a single step using anion-exchange chromatography. Homologous molecular modeling of this enzyme identified crucial differences in the enzyme active site that may be responsible for its high selectivity for N-acetylglucosamine substrates compared to fungal beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases from other sources. The enzyme was used in a sequential reaction together with a mutant beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from Talaromyces flavus with an enhanced synthetic capability, affording a bioactive disaccharide bearing an azido functional group. The azido function enabled an elegant multivalent presentation of this disaccharide on an aromatic carrier. The resulting model glycoconjugate is applicable as a selective ligand of galectin-3 - a biomedically attractive human lectin. These results highlight the importance of a general availability of robust and well-defined carbohydrate-active enzymes with tailored catalytic properties for biotechnological and biomedical applications.</p></details></div>

Amounts of biopharmaceutical drugs and industrial enzymes have been successfully produced by fed-batch high-cell-density fermentation (HCDF) of this cell factory. High levels of cell mass in defined media can be easily achieved and therefore large quantities of recombinant proteins with enhanced activities and lower costs can be obtained through HCDF technology. A robust HCDF process makes a successful transition to commercial production. Recently, efforts have been made to increase the heterologous protein production and activity by the HCDF of P. pastoris. However, challenges around selecting a suitable HCDF strategy exist. The high-level expression of a specific protein in P. pastoris is still, at least in part, limited by optimizing the methanol feeding strategy. Here, we review the progress in developments and applications of P. pastoris HCDF strategies for enhanced expression of recombinant proteins. We focus on the methanol induction strategies for efficient fed-batch HCDF in bioreactors, mainly focusing on various stat-induction strategies, co-feeding, and the limited induction strategy. These processes control strategies have opened the door for expressing foreign proteins in P. pastoris and are expected to enhance the production of recombinant proteins.</p></details></div>

Recombinant riceXIP (rePriceXIP) was secreted into the supernatant and purified to homogeneity with the use of Ni-affinity resin. The molecular mass of rePriceXIP was approximately 44.0kDa. RePriceXIP significantly inhibited the activity of GH11 xylanases in a concentration-dependent manner. The optimal inhibitory activity of rePriceXIP on GH11 xylanases (TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526) occurred at 40 degrees C for 30min. The IC50 values of rePriceXIP inhibiting TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 (0.5 U) were 45, 40, and 40nM, respectively. The Ki of rePriceXIP on TfxA_CD214 xylanase was 12.2nM. Increasing the concentration of rePriceXIP did not change Vmax, but increased Km, thereby suggesting that the inhibition was competitive. Analysis of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the Kq values for TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 exceeded 2.0x10(10)Lmol(-1)*s(-1), implying that static quenching occurred. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that rePriceXIP bound to xylanase, thereby changing the secondary structure and reducing the catalytic activity of xylanase. Lower levels of hydrolytes are released from beechwood xylan by xylanases in the presence of rePriceXIP.</p></details></div>

However, as the tight regulation and methanol dependence of PAOX1 restricts its application, it is necessary to develop a flexible induction system to avoid the problems of methanol without losing the advantages of PAOX1. The availability of synthetic biology tools enables researchers to reprogram the cellular behaviour of P. pastoris to achieve this goal.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The characteristics of PAOX1 are highly related to the expression profile of methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1). In this study, we applied a biologically inspired strategy to reprogram regulatory networks in P. pastoris. A reprogrammed P. pastoris was constructed by inserting a synthetic positive feedback circuit of Mxr1 driven by a weak AOX2 promoter (PAOX2). This novel approach enhanced PAOX1 efficiency by providing extra Mxr1 and generated switchable Mxr1 expression to allow PAOX1 to be induced under glycerol starvation or carbon-free conditions. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of glycerol on PAOX1 was retained because the synthetic circuit was not activated in response to glycerol. Using green fluorescent protein as a demonstration, this reprogrammed P. pastoris strain displayed stronger fluorescence intensity than non-reprogrammed cells under both methanol induction and glycerol starvation. Moreover, with single-chain variable fragment (scFv) as the model protein, increases in extracellular scFv productivity of 98 and 269% were observed in Mxr1-reprogrammed cells under methanol induction and glycerol starvation, respectively, compared to productivity in non-reprogrammed cells under methanol induction.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We successfully demonstrate that the synthetic positive feedback circuit of Mxr1 enhances recombinant protein production efficiency in P. pastoris and create a methanol-free induction system to eliminate the potential risks of methanol.</p></details></div>

Despite the widespread distribution of HM polysaccharides, their biosynthesis remains mechanistically unclear. HM is elongated by glycosyltransferases (GTs) from the cellulose synthase-like A (CSLA) family. MANNAN-SYNTHESIS RELATED (MSR) putative GTs have also been implicated in (gluco)mannan synthesis, but their roles have been difficult to decipher in planta and in vitro. To further characterize the products of the HM synthases and accessory proteins, we chose a synthetic biology approach to synthesize plant HM in yeast.

Based on sequential chemical and enzymatic extractions, followed by detailed structural analyses, the newly produced HM polymers were unbranched and could be larger than 270 kDa. Using CSLAs from different species, we programmed yeast cells to produce an HM backbone composed exclusively of Man or also incorporating Glc. We demonstrate that specific MSR cofactors were indispensable for mannan synthase activity of a coffee CSLA or modulated a functional CSLA enzyme to produce glucomannan instead of mannan. Therefore, this powerful platform yields functional insight into the molecular machinery required for HM biosynthesis in plants.</p></details></div>

After aligning 14 BoIFN-omega subtypes and assigning the most frequently occurring amino acids in each position, one artificial consensus BoIFN-omega (CoBoIFN-omega) gene was designed, optimized and synthesized. Then, CoBoIFN-omega was expressed in Pichia pastoris, which was demonstrated to have 3.94-fold and 14.3-fold higher antiviral activity against VSV on MDBK cells than that of BoIFN-omega24 and BoIFN-omega3, respectively. Besides this, CoBoIFN-omega was confirmed to have antiviral activity against VSV on BL, BT, PK-15 cells, and against BEV, BHV-1, BPIV3 on MDBK cells. Additionally, CoBoIFN-omega could bind with bovine type I IFN receptors, and then activate the promoters of NF-kappaB, ISRE and BoIFN-beta, and induce the transcription of ISGs and expression of Mx1 and NF-kappaB p65, which suggested CoBoIFN-omega exerts antiviral activity via activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Overall, this research on CoBoIFN-omega not only extends and improves consensus IFN research, but also reveals that CoBoIFN-omega has the potential to be used in the therapy of bovine viral diseases.</p></details></div>

In the current study, we demonstrate the production and validation of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) recombinant (md) gonadotropins Fshbeta (mdFshbeta), Lhbeta (mdLhbeta), Fshbetaalpha (mdFshbetaalpha), and Lhbetaalpha (mdLhbetaalpha) by Pichia pastoris, the generation of specific rabbit antibodies against their respective beta subunits, and their use within the development and validation of competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for quantification of medaka Fsh and Lh. mdFsh and mdLh were produced as single-chain polypeptides by linking the alpha subunit with mdFshbeta or mdLhbeta mature protein coding sequences to produce a "tethered" polypeptide with the beta-chain at the N-terminal and the alpha-chain at the C-terminal. The specificity of the antibodies raised against mdFshbeta and mdLhbeta was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) for Fshbeta and Lhbeta on medaka pituitary tissue, while comparison with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for fshb and lhb mRNA was used for validation. Competitive ELISAs were developed using antibodies against mdFshbeta or mdLhbeta, and the tethered proteins mdFshbetaalpha or mdLhbetaalpha for standard curves. The standard curve for the Fsh ELISA ranged from 97.6pg/ml to 50ng/ml, and for the Lh ELISA from 12.21pg/ml to 6.25ng/ml. The sensitivity of the assays for Fsh and Lh was 44.7 and 70.8pg/ml, respectively. A profile of pituitary protein levels of medaka Fsh and Lh comparing juveniles with adults showed significant increase of protein amount from juvenile group (body length from 12mm to 16.5mm) to adult group (body length from 21mm to 26.5mm) for both hormones in male medaka. Comparing these data to a developmental profile of pituitary mRNA expression of medaka fshb and lhb, the mRNA expression of lhb also increased during male maturation and a linear regression analysis revealed a significant increase of lhb expression with increased body length that proposes a linear model. However, fshb mRNA expression did not change significantly during male development and therefore was not correlated with body length. In summary, we have developed and validated homologous ELISA assays for medaka Fsh and Lh based on proteins produced in P. pastoris, assays that will be used to study the functions and regulations of Fsh and Lh in more detail.</p></details></div>

Molecular analysis of the ACS-encoding gene product KpAcs1 revealed that its N-terminal motif, which is conserved in methylotrophic yeasts, was required for ethanol repression. ACS activity was downregulated during methanol-induced gene expression, which partially depended on autophagy. In addition, acetyl-CoA synthesis and phosphorylation of a transcription factor KpMxr1 were found to contribute to ethanol repression in a synergistic manner.</p></details></div>

An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of recombinant xylanase on ruminal fermentation and microbial community structure in in vitro incubation of these straws. The recombinant xylanase from Lentinula edodes (rLeXyn11A) was produced in Pichia pastoris. The optimal temperature and pH for rLeXyn11A were 40 degrees C and 4.0, respectively. The rLeXyn11A featured resistance to high temperature and showed broad temperature adaptability (>50% of the maximum activity at 20-80 degrees C). Supplemental rLeXyn11A enhanced the hydrolysis of three agricultural straws. After in vitro ruminal incubation, regardless of agricultural straws, the fiber digestibility, acetate concentration, total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production, and fermentation liquid microbial protein were increased by rLeXyn11A. Supplemental rLeXyn11A increased the ammonia-N concentration for corn straw and rice straw. High throughput sequencing and real-time PCR data showed that the effects of rLeXyn11A on ruminal microbial community depended on the fermentation substrates. With rice straw, rLeXyn11A increased the relative abundance of fibrolytic bacteria including Firmicutes, Desulfovibrio, Ruminococcaceae and its some genus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes. With wheat straw, rLeXyn11A increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus_1 and its three representative species F. succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Ruminococcus albus. With corn straw, the fibrolytic bacteria Firmicutes, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group, Saccharofermentans, and Desulfovibrio were increased by rLeXyn11A. This study demonstrates that rLeXyn11A could enhance in vitro ruminal digestion and fermentation of agricultural straws, showing the potential of rLeXyn11A for improving the utilization of agricultural straws in ruminants.</p></details></div>

Here we describe a CFPS platform derived from Pichia pastoris, a popular recombinant protein expression host both in academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. A novel ribosome biosensor was developed to optimize the cell extract harvest time. Using this biosensor we identified a potential bottleneck in ribosome content. Therefore, we undertook strain engineering to overexpress global regulators of ribosome biogenesis to increase in vitro protein production. CFPS extracts from the strain overexpressing FHL1 had a 3-fold increase in recombinant protein yield compared to those from the wild-type X33 strain. Furthermore, our novel CFPS platform can produce complex therapeutic proteins, as exemplified by the production of human serum albumin to a final yield of 48.1 mug mL(-1) . Therefore, this work not only adds to the growing number of CFPS systems from diverse organisms, but also provides a blueprint for rapidly engineering new strains with increased productivity in vitro that could be applied to other organisms.

Since the process dynamics typically exhibit nonlinear interactions amongst the critical process variables, the commonly employed controllers are suboptimal for control of most bioprocesses. In this article, we present the implementation of an augmented controller for improving the production of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) using Pichia pastoris. The augmented controller consists of a decoupled adaptive control (DAC) and a decoupled input-output linearizing control (DIOLC) in a combined architecture that permits simultaneous control of substrate concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration, sampled at different rates during fed-batch fermentation. The performance of DAC-DIOLC controller was compared to the performance of DAC and DIOLC implemented individually on the process. Our results show that the augmented controller better regulates the substrate and dissolved oxygen (DO), along the desired control trajectory compared to the individual DAC and DIOLC controllers. The performance of the augmented DAC-DIOLC controller showed deviations of only 0.021 g/L from substrate set point compared to 0.09 g/L in PID and 0.031 g/L in DIOLC, and a 1.12% deviation from DO set point compared to 11.86% in PID and 2.58% in DAC.

In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of the nuclease from extremely psychrophilic bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii that grows exponentially at 5 degrees C, but may also grow at even lower temperatures (down to - 12 degrees C). The putative endonuclease I gene, identified in the genome of P. ingrahamii, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein was purified and its nucleolytic features were studied. The new enzyme, named by us as PinNuc, displays the features characteristic for the nonselective endonucleases, and has the ability to degrade different forms of nucleic acids. It is very active at room temperature in low ion-strength buffer and in the presence of low concentrations of magnesium ions. The enzyme, which possesses six cysteine residues, the most likely all engaged in disulphide bridges, is active only in oxidized form, and can be efficiently inactivated by the addition of low amounts of a reducing agent. According to our knowledge, it is the first nuclease, belonging to endonuclease I family, isolated from such extremely psychrophilic organism.</p></details></div>

High level of extracellular amylase production of 72 U/mL was obtained after a 72 h induction by methanol. As expected, the recombinant strain produced only the AmyA isoform since the host is a protease deficient strain. Besides, the purified r-AmyA showed a molecular mass of 54 kDa, the same pH optimum equal to 5.6 but a higher thermoactivity of 60 degrees C against 50 degrees C for the native enzyme. Unlike AmyA which maintained 50% of its activity after a 10-min incubation at 60 degrees C, r-AmyA reached 45 min. The higher thermoactivity and thermostability could be related to the N-glycosylation. The r-AmyA activity was enhanced by 46% and 45% respectively in the presence of 4 mM Fe(2+) and Mg(2+) ions. This enzyme was more efficient in bread-making since such ions were reported to have a positive impact on the nutriment quality and the rheological characteristics of the wheat flour dough. The thermoactivity/thermostability as well as the iron and magnesium activations could also be ascribed to the presence of an additional C-terminal loop containing the His tag.</p></details></div>

Here, we report the cloning, heterologous expression, purification and characterization of a novel LMCO from the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila. The 1953 bp lmco gene sequence comprises of 3 exons interrupted by 2 introns and according to the LccED database the translated sequence belongs to superfamily 6 of multicopper oxidases. After removal of the introns, the gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris, under the control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous enzyme was purified with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa. TtLMCO1 displayed optimum activity at pH 4 and 50 degrees C and appeared thermostable up to 50 degrees C. A variety of phenolic compounds were oxidized by TtLMCO1, including standard laccase substrates such as ABTS and 2,6 dimethoxyphenol. The UV/Vis spectrum of purified TtLMCO1 indicates that it belongs to yellow laccase-like oxidases. The enzyme was used for the bioconversion of 2',3,4-trihydroxychalcone to 3',4'-dihydroxy-aurone, a bioactive aurone recently shown to possess inhibitory activity against several isoforms of the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Overall, the thermophilic yellow LMCO TtLMCO1 presents a number of superior properties with potential use in industrial biocatalysis.</p></details></div>

Both lipases were active on insoluble triglycerides as well as natural oils and hydrolyzed preferably esters with short and medium acyl and alkyl chains.

This ultimately results in progressive dysfunction and loss of vision either in advanced age for genetically normal patients (age-related macular degeneration) or in adolescence for those with inherited genetic mutations (Stargardt's disease). In this article, we present a proof-of-concept study for an enzyme-based therapy to remove these retinoids, modeled on traditional enzyme replacement therapy. Recombinant manganese peroxidase (rMnP) is produced in Pichia pastoris. In vitro, we demonstrate that rMnP breaks down A2E and other lipofuscin fluorophores with limited cellular toxicity, and as this enzyme is mannosylated, it can be taken up into cells through mannose receptor-dependent endocytosis. In vivo, we demonstrate that rMnP can significantly reduce the A2E burden when administered by intravitreal injections. Together, these data provide encouraging results toward the development of an enzyme-based therapy for macular degeneration and indicate the need for additional work to characterize the molecular mechanism of A2E breakdown and to improve the pharmacological parameters of the enzyme.</p></details></div>

The recombinant P. pastoris was inoculated in to BMMY culture medium, incubation with 5mul/ml absolute methanol for 72hat 30 degrees C. The TC-1 peptide was concentrated with nickel affinity chromatography and electrophoresis on 16% acrylamide gels. The molecular weight of recombinant TC-1 is approximately 8kDa and under these conditions, the concentration of TC-1 considered 190mug/ml that determined by the Bradford method. The antimicrobial activity test (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) was done against: Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of these pathogenic bacteria was limited when we used peptide at a concentration of as low as 19.56mug/ml. Based on DPPH radical scavenging (DPPH-RS) activity and reducing power assays, this peptide showed relatively good antioxidant potential in comparison with standard antioxidant used in this study (BHT). Due to the existence of TC-1 in blood, which makes it safe for human consumption, and the good results of its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, it can be introduced as a good alternative and a novel effective peptide to food industry for bio-preservation.</p></details></div>

Currently, heparin is mainly extracted from porcine mucosa. However, animal-derived heparin shows low anticoagulant activity due to the low proportion of the anticoagulant active unit, the GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS6S3S-Ido2S-GlcNS6S pentasaccharide. In this study we proposed an enzymatic strategy to sulfate the animal-sourced heparin to increase the proportion of anticoagulant pentasaccharide and the anticoagulant activity. First, three sulfotransferases HS2ST, HS6ST, and HS3ST were expressed tentatively in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. After measuring the sulfotransferase activity, we confirmed P. pastoris GS115 is the better host for sulfotransferases production. Then, the maltose binding protein (MBP) and thioredoxin (TrxA) were fused separately to the N-terminal of sulfotransferases to increase enzyme solubility. As a result, the yields of HS2ST and HS6ST were increased to (839+/-14) U/L and (792+/-23) U/L, respectively. Subsequent sulfation of the animal-sourced heparin with the recombinant HS2ST, HS6ST and HS3ST increased the anticoagulant activity from (76+/-2) IU/mg to (189+/-17) IU/mg.</p></details></div>

Monoclonal and human IgE-antibody binding was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Allergen-induced degranulation by human epsilon receptor expressed-rat basophil was determined.

Half a dozen different luciferins, molecules that emit light when enzymatically oxidized, are known. However, just one biochemical pathway for luciferin biosynthesis has been described in full, which is found only in bacteria. Here, we report identification of the fungal luciferase and three other key enzymes that together form the biosynthetic cycle of the fungal luciferin from caffeic acid, a simple and widespread metabolite. Introduction of the identified genes into the genome of the yeast Pichia pastoris along with caffeic acid biosynthesis genes resulted in a strain that is autoluminescent in standard media. We analyzed evolution of the enzymes of the luciferin biosynthesis cycle and found that fungal bioluminescence emerged through a series of events that included two independent gene duplications. The retention of the duplicated enzymes of the luciferin pathway in nonluminescent fungi shows that the gene duplication was followed by functional sequence divergence of enzymes of at least one gene in the biosynthetic pathway and suggests that the evolution of fungal bioluminescence proceeded through several closely related stepping stone nonluminescent biochemical reactions with adaptive roles. The availability of a complete eukaryotic luciferin biosynthesis pathway provides several applications in biomedicine and bioengineering.</p></details></div>

However, hypermannosylation hinders the use of recombinant proteins from yeast in most biopharmaceutical applications. Glyco-engineered yeast strains produce more homogeneously glycosylated proteins, but can be physiologically impaired and show tendencies for cellular agglomeration, hence are hard to cultivate. Further, comprehensive data regarding growth, physiology and recombinant protein production in the controlled environment of a bioreactor are scarce.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A Man5GlcNAc2 glycosylating and a Man8-10GlcNAc2 glycosylating strain showed similar morphological traits during methanol induced shake-flask cultivations to produce the recombinant model protein HRP C1A. Both glyco-engineered strains displayed larger single and budding cells than a wild type strain as well as strong cellular agglomeration. The cores of these agglomerates appeared to be less viable. Despite agglomeration, the Man5GlcNAc2 glycosylating strain showed superior growth, physiology and HRP C1A productivity compared to the Man8-10GlcNAc2 glycosylating strain in shake-flasks and in the bioreactor. Conducting dynamic methanol pulsing revealed that HRP C1A productivity of the Man5GlcNAc2 glycosylating strain is best at a temperature of 30 degrees C.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of growth, physiology and recombinant protein production of a Man5GlcNAc2 glycosylating strain in the controlled environment of a bioreactor. Furthermore, it is evident that cellular agglomeration is likely triggered by a reduced glycan length of cell surface glycans, but does not necessarily lead to lower metabolic activity and recombinant protein production. Man5GlcNAc2 glycosylated HRP C1A production is feasible, yields active protein similar to the wild type strain, but thermal stability of HRP C1A is negatively affected by reduced glycosylation.</p></details></div>

In this study, we obtained a multi-copy irisin-expressing P. pastoris strain through an optimized method, which is pH5.5, 1.8% methanol for 96h, for producing a high amount of recombinant irisin protein following a series of screening and optimization procedures. The higher-glycosylated irisin, which is supposed to be the active form was obtained by dialysis and ion-exchange chromatography purification method. Both of the laser scanning confocal microscope and the atomic force microscope not only detected the high-effectiveness entering cells of FITC-irisin but also localized it on the membrane of HepG2 cells. Immunofluorescence staining further suggested that irisin could localize in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus.

In summary, we developed an efficient irisin-expressing P. pastoris strain and optimal expression condition, visualized its distribution, demonstrated biological activity and potential mechanisms in hepatic cells.</p></details></div>

The full-length cDNA sequence of CfLRRop-7 was 1463 bp and contained an open reading frame of 1086 bp, which encoded a protein of 361 amino acids. Five LRR motifs with a conserved signature sequence LxxLxLxxNxL were identified in the predicted protein sequence. The expression of CfLRRop-7 was particularly high in hemocytes. The expression of CfLRRop-7 was relatively high in oocytes and embryos during the ontogenesis of scallops. CfLRRop-7 expression changed in hemocytes in response to stimulation with different microbes, including Vibrio splendidus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pichia pastoris. CfLRRop-7 recognized five kinds of ligands/agonists. CfLRRop-7 recombinant protein inhibited bacterial proliferation in hemolymph and induced lysozyme activity in serum.

Methanol concentration (MeOH) and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) are two crucial operating parameters controlling proteins production. It is difficult to control MeOH/DO at their desired levels simultaneously due to the extremely high oxygen consumption features. Methanol utilization plus (Mut(+)) and slow (Mut(S)) strains are the two typical phenotypes of recombinant P. pastoris with quite different dynamic characteristics. Therefore, different MeOH/DO combinational control strategies or sub-optimal induction strategies could be adopted. Environments of "high MeOH/low DO" and "high DO/low MeOH" are the realistic induction strategies. In this study, we summarized our own experimental results (using Mut(+)/Mut(S) strains to produce human serum albumin-human granulocyte colony stimulating factor-HSA-GCSF(m)/porcine interferon-alpha-pIFN-alpha), and compared to data from the literature using the above mentioned two induction strategies. The results suggested that, heterologous proteins production by Mut(+) strains favors "high DO/low MeOH (DO ~ 10%, MeOH ~ 0 g/L)" induction condition, while proteins production by Mut(S) strains prefers "high MeOH/low DO (MeOH 5-10 g/L, DO ~ 0%)" induction environment. Thus, based on the P. pastoris types, the corresponding sub-optimal induction strategies should be applied accordingly. The related metabolic analysis indicating methanol utilizing efficiency and the transcriptional analysis reflecting gene up- or down-regulations involved in several key routes in methanol and sorbitol metabolism were implemented. The analysis results strongly supported the conclusions of using the proposed sub-optimal induction strategies for different heterologous proteins production by Mut(+) and Mut(S) strains.</p></details></div>

It provides Crabtree positive yeasts an evolutionary advantage of consuming glucose faster and producing ethanol to outcompete other microorganisms in sugar rich environments. While a number of genetic events are associated with the emergence of the Crabtree effect, its evolution remains unresolved. Here we show that overexpression of a single Gal4-like transcription factor is sufficient to convert Crabtree-negative Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) into a Crabtree positive yeast. Upregulation of the glycolytic genes and a significant increase in glucose uptake rate due to the overexpression of the Gal4-like transcription factor leads to an overflow metabolism, triggering both short-term and long-term Crabtree phenotypes. This indicates that a single genetic perturbation leading to overexpression of one gene may have been sufficient as the first molecular event towards respiro-fermentative metabolism in the course of yeast evolution.</p></details></div>

Among wheat components, the alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATI) are important triggers of several allergies and activators of innate immunity. ATI are a group of exogenous protease inhibitors and include several polypeptides. The three ATI polypeptides named CM3, CM16 and 0.28 are considered major allergens, and might also play a role in other common wheat-related pathologies, such as Non Celiac Wheat Sensitivity and even Celiac Disease. On this basis, we pointed to obtain high amounts of them in purity and to evaluate their allergenicity potential. We thus isolated the mRNA corresponding to the three ATI genes CM3, CM16 and 0.28 from 28 days post-anthesis wheat kernels and the corresponding cDNAs were used for heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. The three purified proteins were tested in degranulation assay against human sera of patients with food allergy to wheat. A large range of degranulation values was observed for each protein according to the sera tested. All of the three purified proteins CM3, CM16 and 0.28 were active as allergens because they were able to induce basophils degranulation on wheat allergic patients' sera, with the highest values of beta-hexosaminidase release observed for CM3 protein.</p></details></div>

The oxidative stress inflicts severe injury to yeast cells, which causes cell death and reduces protein expression ability. N-acetyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can protect yeast cells from damage caused by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oxidative pressure environments such as ethanol treatment, freeze-thawing, or heat shock. In this study, N-acetyltransferase from P. pastoris (PpMpr1) was overexpressed for the first time to improve the anti-oxidative stress ability to protect cells from strong ROS damage during the methanol induction phase. Cell viability of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain increased significantly, while biomass was increased by 22.7% at high dissolved oxygen (DO). At the same time, the heterologous alpha-glucosidase (AGL) expression level at 25% DO was increased by 21.5%. The AGL degradation was greatly relieved in the fermentation supernatant of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain. This study shows that PpMpr1 has a great potential for improvement of anti-oxidative stress ability in P. pastoris and provides a promising recombinant microorganism for industrial production of proteins.</p></details></div>

The deduced Bgl3B contains 860 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 91.2 kDa. The purified recombinant Bgl3B exhibited maximum activities at pH 4.5 and 65 degrees C and remained stable at temperatures up to 60 degrees C and pH 3.0-9.0, respectively. The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificities, showing beta-glucosidase, glucanase, cellobiase, xylanase, and isoflavone glycoside hydrolase activities, and its activities were stimulated by short-chain alcohols. The catalytic efficiencies of Bgl3B were 693 and 104/mM/s towards pNPG and cellobiose, respectively.

The PCV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) are a powerful subunit vaccine that can elicit high immune response due to its native PCV2 virus morphology. The baculovirus expression system is the widely used platform for producing commercial PCV2 VLP vaccines, but its yield and cost limited the development of low-cost vaccines for veterinary applications. Here, we applied a nonconventional yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus to enhance the production of PCV2 VLPs. After codon optimization, the PCV2 Cap protein was expressed in K. marxianus and assemble spontaneously into VLPs. Using a chemically defined medium, we achieved approximately 1.91 g/L of PCV2 VLP antigen in a 5-L bioreactor after high cell density fermentation for 72 h. That yield greatly exceeded to recently reported PCV2 VLPs obtained by baculovirus-insect cell, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. By the means of two-step chromatography, 652.8 mg of PCV2 VLP antigen was obtained from 1 L of the recombinant K. marxianus cell culture. The PCV2 VLPs induced high level of anti-PCV2 IgG antibody in mice serums and decreased the virus titers in both livers and spleens of the challenged mice. These results illustrated that K. marxianus is a powerful yeast for cost-effective production of PCV2 VLP vaccines.</p></details></div>

Additionally, the recombinant expression of nanobodies is robust in various expression systems, such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. P. pastoris is the most widely used microorganism for nanobody production, but all or almost all expression vectors developed for this system are based on the regulated promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1) that requires methanol for full induction. In this study, a constitutive anti-CEACAM5 nanobody expression system was constructed under the control of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (GAP) promoter. The effects of different carbon sources and pH on nanobody expression were evaluated in shaking flask cultures. After 96h of constitutive expression in shaking flask, a yield of 51.71mg/L was obtained. In addition, this constitutive expression system produced nanobodies at equivalent yield and affinity to that produced by methanol-induced expression. The results of this study indicated that the use of a constitutive expression system is a promising alternative for the production of nanobodies applied for cancer diagnosis and therapy.</p></details></div>

Proteins are the most abundant macromolecules in living systems with a central role in all biological processes. These organic molecules are modified by ACP exposure that is responsible for many of ACP's biological effects. This study evaluated the effect of ACP on the production of recombinant phytase in yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) as well as the structure and function of the phytase enzyme. The results indicated that yeast cells treated with ACP, directly or indirectly, produced higher amounts of recombinant phytase, which was associated with the time of ACP treatment. The exposure of commercial phytase solution with ACP caused a significant increase in the enzyme activity (125%) after 4 hours. Evaluation of the phytase solution by far- and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence analysis indicated that this protein maintained its secondary structure when exposed to ACP while the tertiary structure was slightly unfolded. The effects of heat and H2O2 on the phytase structure and function were compared with the effect of ACP treatment. The modification of Cys, Tyr and Trp amino acids upon reactive oxygen/nitrogen spices was simulated using a molecular dynamics approach. RMSF and RMSD analysis suggested that this structural alteration occurs owing to changes made by reactive species in accessible amino acids.</p></details></div>

Biochemical analysis demonstrated that ChiE1 is an exochitinase with a processive mode of action. Although ChiE1 contains only a single catalytic domain without a binding domain, it can bind to and degrade insoluble chitin powder and colloidal chitin. The combination of ChiE1 and C. cinerea endochitinase ChiIII could increase the amount of reducing sugar released from chitin powder by approximately 120% compared to using ChiE1 and ChiIII alone. The synergistic action of ChiE1 and ChiIII on degradation of chitin powder is higher than all previously reported synergism of chitinases.

Mutations in the human AC gene asah1 are known to cause Farber disease and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy.

One of the ancestral sources of fungal nutrition could be products following enzymatic degradation of plant material. However, carbohydrate-active enzymes from these ancient fungi have been less studied. A GH11 xylanase (RrXyn11A) (EC 3.2.1.8) and a GH43 xylosidase (RrXyl43A) (EC 3.2.1.37) were identified from an early-lineage aerobic zoosporic fungus, Rhizophlyctis rosea NBRC 105426. Both genes were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant enzymes were purified and characterized. The optimal pH for recombinant RrXyn11A and RrXyl43A was pH 7. RrXyn11A had high stability over a wide range of pH (4-8) and temperature (25-70 degrees C). RrXyn11A also showed high substrate specificity on both azurine-cross-linked (AZCL) arabinoxylan and AZCL xylan. RrXyl43A had beta-xylosidase and minor alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activity. This enzyme showed low product inhibition and retained 51% activity in the presence of 100 mM xylose. A combination of RrXyn11A and RrXyl43A exhibited significantly higher hydrolytic and polymer degradation capability and xylose release on wheat bran and beechwood xylan compared to treatment with commercial enzymes.

However, a key difference between yeasts and mammalian cells involves the type of glycosylation structures, which hampers the use of yeasts for the production of many biopharmaceuticals. Glycosylation is not only important for the folding process of most recombinant proteins; it has a large impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the therapeutic proteins as well. Yeasts' hypermannosylated glycosyl structures in some cases can evoke immune responses and lead to rapid clearance of the therapeutic protein from the blood. This chapter highlights the efforts made so far regarding the glyco-engineering of N- and O-type glycosylation, removing or reducing yeast-specific glycans. In some cases, this is combined with the introduction of humanized glycosylation pathways. After many years of patient development to overcome remaining challenges, these efforts have now culminated in effective solutions that should allow yeasts to reclaim the primary position in biopharmaceutical manufacturing that they enjoyed in the early days of biotechnology.

In the present study, a full-length cDNA sequence of a gC1qR homolog (PtgC1qR) in Portunus trituberculatus was identified. PtgC1qR was a 268-amino-acid polypeptide with a conserved MAM33 domain and a mitochondrial targeting sequence in the first 56 amino acids. The transcripts of PtgC1qR were detected in all examined tissues with the highest level detected in the hepatopancreas. Compared with other early embryonic stages, PtgC1qR was highly expressed in the fertilized eggs and embryos at the cleavage stage, which suggest PtgC1qR may be a maternal gene. The transcripts of PtgC1qR in hemocytes exhibited time-dependent response expression pattern after challenged with bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus) and fungi (Pichia pastoris). Moreover, the recombinant PtgC1qR (rPtgC1qR) exhibited strong antibacterial activity and microbial-binding activity, suggesting its crucial role in immune defense and recognition. Further phenoloxidase (PO) assay showed that rPtgC1qR could suppress the crab PO activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and it could result in nearly 100% inhibition of PO activity under the concentration of 11.65muM. Knockdown of PtgC1qR could significantly enhance the expression of serine protease related genes (PtSP1-3 and PtSPH), proPO-associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and C3-like genes (Ptalpha2M1 and PtTEP). However, the phagocytosis related genes (PtMyosin, PtRab5 and PtArp) and Ptalpha2M2 were significantly down-regulated in the PtgC1qR silenced crabs. These findings together demonstrate that PtgC1qR might function in crab immune response via its antibacterial activity, immune recognition or regulating the proPO system, complement pathway and phagocytosis.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a novel globular C1qDC (CgC1qDC-7) was characterized from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The open reading frame of CgC1qDC-7 was of 555 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 185 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CgC1qDC-7 shared high homology with C1qDCs from Crassostrea virginica, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and Mizuhopecten yessoensis. The mRNA transcripts of CgC1qDC-7 were widely expressed in all the tested tissues including mantle, gonad, gills, adductor muscle, hemocytes, hepatopancreas and labial palps, with the highest expression level in hemocytes and gills. The recombinant protein of CgC1qDC-7 (rCgC1qDC-7) exhibited binding activity towards Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio splendidus, V. anguillarum, Escherichia coli, V. alginolyticus, and Aeromonas hydrophila), Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus) and fungi (Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica), and displayed strongest binding affinity towards Gram-negative bacteria V. splendidus and V. anguillarum.

In present study, we identified a crustin gene in Scylla paramamosain, which was named as SpCrus6. The ORF of SpCrus6 possessed a signal peptide sequence (SPS) at the N-terminus and a WAP domain at the C-terminus. And there were 5 Proline residues, 5 Glycine and 4 Cysteine residues between SPS and WAP domain in SpCrus6. These features indicated that SpCrus6 was a new member of crustin family. The SpCrus6 mRNA transcripts were up-regulated obviously after bacteria or virus challenge. These changes showed that SpCrus6 was involved in the antimicrobial and antiviral responses of Scylla paramamosain. Recombinant SpCrus6 (rSpCrus6) showed strong inhibitory abilities against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis). But the inhibitory abilities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio parahemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio harveyi and Escherichia coli) and two fungi (Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans) were not strong enough. Besides, rSpCrus6 could strongly bind to two Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis and B. megaterium) and three Gram-negative bacteria (V. alginolyticus, V. parahemolyticus, and V. harveyi). And the binding levels to S. aureus and two fungi (P. pastoris and C. albicans) were weak. The polysaccharides binding assays' results showed rSpCrus6 had superior binding activities to LPS, LTA, PGN and beta-glucan. Through agglutinating assays, we found rSpCrus6 could agglutinate well three Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, B. subtilis and B. megaterium). And the agglutinating activities to Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were not found. In the aspect of antiviral functions, rSpCrus6 could bind specifically to the recombinant envelop protein 26 (rVP26) of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) but not to recombinant envelop protein 28 (rVP28), whereas GST protein could not bind to rVP26 or rVP28. Besides, rSpCrus6 could suppress WSSV reproduction to some extent. Taken together, SpCrus6 was a multifunctional immunity effector in the innate immunity defending response of S. paramamosain.</p></details></div>

This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of wheat beta-1,3-glucanase on fungi most commonly associated with wheat kernel. A beta-1,3-glucanase from wheat was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 and its biochemical and antifungal properties were characterized herein. The molecular weight of recombinant beta-1,3-glucanase is approximately 33 kDa. beta-1,3-glucanase displays optimal activity at pH 6.5, remaining relatively high at pH 5.5-8.0. The optimal reaction temperature of beta-1,3-glucanase is 50 degrees C, retaining approximately 84.0% residual activity after heat-treated at 50 degrees C for 1h. The steady-state kinetic parameters of beta-1,3-glucanase against laminarin was determined and the Km and Vmax were 1.32+/-0.20mg/ml and 96.4+/-4.4 Umg(-1) protein, respectively. The inhibitory effect of purified beta-1,3-glucanase against the seven fungi commonly associated with wheat kernel was assessed in vitro. beta-1,3-glucanase exerted differential inhibitory effects on hyphal growth of Fusarium graminearum, Alternaria sp., A. glaucus, A. flavus, A. niger, and Penicillium sp. Spore formation and mycelial morphology of Alternaria sp., A. flavus, and A. niger were significantly affected by beta-1,3-glucanase (1U).

BoHV-5 glycoprotein D (gD5) is essential for attachment and penetration into permissive cells and targeting of host immune systems, inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccinal immune response of vaccines formulated with the recombinant BoHV-5 gD (rgD5) in bovines. For the experiment, 72 heifers were randomly allotted into 6 different groups with 12 animals each. Group 1: vaccine formulated using inactivated BoHV-5 (iBoHV-5) adjuvanted with ISA50V2; Group 2: iBoHV-5 associated with 100microg of rgD5 adjuvanted with ISA50V2; Group 3: 100microg of rgD5 adjuvanted with ISA50V2; Group 4: 100microg of rgD5 adjuvanted with Al(OH)3; Group 5: commercial vaccine; and Group 6: control group. Two doses were administered in a 26-day interval and the third after 357days from primo vaccination. Cattle vaccinated with the vaccines formulated with iBoHV-5 plus rgD5 showed a significant (p<0.01) five-fold increase in total immunoglobulin G (IgG) for BoHV-5, BoHV-1, and rgD5 as compared with the commercial and control groups. Also, a significant (p<0.05) increase in IgG1 and IgG2a levels was induced in serum for rgD5. In addition, these same vaccines showed significant (p<0.01) four-fold higher titers of BoHV-1 and -5 neutralizing antibodies. The results demonstrated that the rgD5 conserved important epitopes that were able to stimulate bovine humoral immunity response capable of viral neutralization of BoHV-1 and -5, suggesting it as a promising vaccine antigen to be used in vaccine for BoHV-1 and -5 endemic areas.</p></details></div>

A series of engineered strains harboring different copy numbers of the ROL gene and different copies of the chaperone Pdi gene were first constructed to examine the influence of Pdi gene copy number on ROL production. The results showed that multiple copies of Pdi gene did not significantly improve ROL expression. Then, the effect of the co-overexpression of 10 expression-related helper proteins on ROL secretion was investigated by screening 20 colonies of each transformants. The data from shaking-flask fermentation suggested that Ssa4, Bmh2, Sso2, Pdi, Bip, Hac1, and VHb had positive effects on ROL expression. Subsequently, Ssa4, Bmh2, and Sso2, which all participate in vesicular trafficking and strongly promote ROL expression, were combined to further improve ROL production level. ROL activity of the screened strain GS115/5ROL-Ssa4-Sso2-Bmh2 4# attained 5230 U/mL. Furthermore, when the helper proteins Pdi, Bip, Hac1, and VHb were individually co-expressed with ROL in the strain GS115/5ROL-Ssa4-Sso2-Bmh2 4#, lipase activity increased to 5650 U/mL in the strain GS115/5ROL-Ssa4-Sso2-Bmh2-VHb 9#. Additionally, the maximum ROL activity of 41,700 U/mL was achieved in a 3 L bioreactor for high-density fermentation via a sorbitol(-)methanol co-feeding strategy, reaching almost twofold the value of the initial strain GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11#. Thus, the strategies in this study significantly increased ROL expression level, which is of great potential for the large-scale production of ROL in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

The FOT could be successfully expressed in Pichiapastoris by engineering the natural propeptide APQEIPN. In this study, we constructed two recombinant enzymes with engineered amino acid sequences added to the N-terminus of FOT and expressed in P. pastoris. The N-terminal residues had various effects on the structural and functional properties of trypsin. The FOT, and the recombinants TE (with peptide YVEF) and TS (with peptide YV) displayed the same optimum temperature (40 degrees C) and pH (8.0). However, the combinants TE and TS showed significantly increased thermal stability at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Moreover, the combinants TE and TS also showed enhanced tolerance of alkaline pH conditions. Compared with those of wild-type FOT, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the cation pi-interactions of the recombinants TE and TS were significantly increased. The recombinants TE and TS also had significantly increased catalytic efficiencies (referring to the specificity constant, kcat/Km), 1.75-fold and 1.23-fold than wild-type FOT. In silico modeling analysis uncovered that the introduction of the peptides YVEF and YV resulted in shorter distances between the substrate binding pocket (D174, G198, and G208) and catalytic triad (His42, Asp102, and Ser180), which would improve the electron transfer rate and catalytic efficiency. In addition, N-terminal residues modification described here may be a useful approach for improving the catalytic efficiencies and characteristics of other target enzymes.</p></details></div>

The amino acids 78-90 was predicted to be the highly flexible region simultaneously by the three methods and hence selected to be the mutation target. We constructed five variants (D3, D5, D7, D9, and D11) by truncating the region.

Moreover, the half-life value of the variant D9 was also found to be dramatically improved by 46 min. Circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence indicated that the structures had no significant change between the variant D9 and the wild-type.

In this paper, using the Universal Proteomic Standard sets 1 and 2 (UPS1 and UPS2, respectively) as an example, we characterized mass spectrometric approaches from the point of view of sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and accuracy (Ac). The aim of the paper was to show the utility of a mass spectra approach for protein detection. This sets consists of 48 high-purity human proteins without single aminoacid polymorphism (SAP) or post translational modification (PTM). The UPS1 set consists of the same 48 proteins at 5 pmols each, and in UPS2, proteins were grouped into 5 groups in accordance with their molar concentration, ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-6) M. Single peptides from the 92% and 96% of all sets of proteins could be detected in a pure solution of UPS2 and UPS1, respectively, by selected reaction monitoring with stable isotope-labeled standards (SRM-SIS). We also found that, in the presence of a biological matrix such as Escherichia coli extract or human blood plasma (HBP), SRM-SIS makes it possible to detect from 63% to 79% of proteins in the UPS2 set (sensitivity) with the highest specificity ( approximately 100%) and an accuracy of 80% by increasing the sensitivity of shotgun and selected reaction monitoring combined with a stable-isotope-labeled peptide standard (SRM-SIS technology) by fractionating samples using reverse-phase liquid chromatography under alkaline conditions (2D-LC_alk). It is shown that this technique of sample fractionation allows the SRM-SIS to detect 98% of the single peptides from the proteins present in the pure solution of UPS2 (47 out of 48 proteins). When the extracts of E. coli or Pichia pastoris are added as biological matrixes to the UPS2, 46, and 45 out of 48 proteins ( approximately 95%) can be detected, respectively, using the SRM-SIS combined with 2D-LC_alk. The combination of the 2D-LC_alk SRM-SIS and shotgun technologies allows us to increase the sensitivity up to 100% in the case of the proteins of the UPS2 set. The usage of that technology can be a solution for identifying the so-called "missing" proteins and, eventually, creating the deep proteome of a particular chromosome of tissue or organs.

MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-di phenyltetrazolium bromide] and cell colony formation assays revealed that irisin significantly inhibited the growth of MIA PaCa-2 and Panc03.27 in a dose-dependent manner. Irisin also induced G1 arrest in both cell lines. Scratch wound healing and transwell assays revealed that irisin also inhibited the migration of PC cells. Irisin reversed the activity of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) while increasing E-cadherin expression and reducing vimentin expression. Irisin activated the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and suppressed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.

To date, five protegrin sequences have been identified in pigs, PG-1 to PG-5. Of these, PG-1 exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a broad range of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms as well as viruses. However, the other potential role(s) of PG beyond antimicrobial has largely been unexplored. The aim of this study was to use nonpathogenic yeast Pichia pastoris to express antimicrobially active recombinant protegrin (rPG-1). Additionally, the effect of PG-1 on cell migration and proliferation was also examined in vitro using pig intestinal epithelial cells as a model. Highest level of rPG-1 (104 +/- 11 mug/mL) was detected at 24 h in fermentation culture medium. Similar to rPG-1, 0.8 +/- 0.10 g/L of proform PG-1 (rProPG-1) and 0.2 +/- 0.02 g/L of the PG-1 cathelin domain (rCath) was detected in fermentation culture medium. Resulting recombinant PG-1 and cleaved rProPG-1 exerted antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5alpha at the same level as chemically synthesized PG-1. Enhanced cell migration was observed (p < 0.05) in groups treated with rProPG-1, rCath, and rPG-1 compared to the control. Furthermore, rPG-1 was stable at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 80 degrees C. In summary, biologically active recombinant protegrin in its pro-, cathelin-, and mature- forms were successfully expressed in P. pastoris suggesting potential feasibility for future therapeutic applications.</p></details></div>

In the current work, we examined the effect of pulsed laser in the continuous laboratory-scale process on cell disruption. Design-of-experiments (DOE) methodology was used for optimization of cell disruption process to obtain the highest protein concentration in the disruption buffer. Our investigations for the pulsed laser at wavelength of 1,064 nm demonstrated that for disrupting P. pastoris cell and releasing rHBsAg, the laser power was the most influential factor, and laser pulse duration and cycle number were in the second and third places. According to the results, the effect of laser power and pulse duration (time) had a direct relationship with protein concentration. For the number of cycles, however, increasing the value from the lowest point at first led to the enhancement and then reduction of protein concentration. The maximum cell disruption and rHBsAg release were recorded for the laser system in the energy input of 284 mW and the pulse duration of 100 mSec after four complete rounds of circulation.</p></details></div>

The budding yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella sp.) is widely employed to secrete proteins of academic and industrial interest. For this yeast, the most commonly used secretion signal is the N-terminal portion of pre-pro-alpha-factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, this secretion signal promotes posttranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), so proteins that can fold in the cytosol may be inefficiently translocated and thus poorly secreted. In addition, if a protein self-associates, the alpha-factor pro region can potentially cause aggregation, thereby hampering export from the ER. This study addresses both limitations of the pre-pro-alpha-factor secretion signal.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We engineered a hybrid secretion signal consisting of the S. cerevisiae Ost1 signal sequence, which promotes cotranslational translocation into the ER, followed by the alpha-factor pro region. Secretion and intracellular localization were assessed using as a model protein the tetrameric red fluorescent protein E2-Crimson. When paired with the alpha-factor pro region, the Ost1 signal sequence yielded much more efficient secretion than the alpha-factor signal sequence. Moreover, an allelic variant of the alpha-factor pro region reduced aggregation of the E2-Crimson construct in the ER. The resulting improved secretion signal enhanced secretion of E2-Crimson up to 20-fold compared to the levels obtained with the original alpha-factor secretion signal. Similar findings were obtained with the lipase BTL2, which exhibited 10-fold enhanced secretion with the improved secretion signal.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The improved secretion signal confers dramatic benefits for the secretion of certain proteins from P. pastoris. These benefits are likely to be most evident for proteins that can fold in the cytosol and for oligomeric proteins.</p></details></div>

Therefore, successful elimination of this disease requires a cost-effective prophylactic agent such as vaccine along with conventional drugs. The Abundant Larval Transcript-2 (BmALT-2) protein of Brugia malayi has been recognized as the most potential vaccine candidate. Tuftsin, a tetra-peptide immunopotentiator has already shown the enhanced immunogenicity of various vaccine antigens in earlier studies. This study deals with the development of tuft-alt-2 fusion construct and a suitable culture condition for its large-scale production in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant P. pastoris/tuft-alt-2 with 9-11 copies of the gene construct exhibited the highest expression level. The molecular weight of P-TUFT-ALT-2 was determined as 28 kDa in SDS-PAGE including 3 kDa due to glycosylation. The dry cell biomass was 57.4 gL(-1) in the bioreactor. The P-TUFT-ALT-2 expression was measured as about 35 mg L(-1), which was 102% higher than flask culture. The P-TUFT-ALT-2 produced the highest 65,000 IgG peak titer in Balb/c mice. Moreover, P-TUFT-ALT-2 exhibited about 9.46% higher splenocyte proliferation than E. coli expressed E-ALT-2 alone. The enhanced secreted production of P-TUFT-ALT-2 in bioreactor would step up its commercialization as an inexpensive commercial vaccine for human lymphatic filariasis.</p></details></div>

Since the protein was glycosylated during secretion from Pichia pastoris, therefore, the role of carbohydrate moieties on its stability was analyzed via in vivo blocking of N-glycosylation using tunicamycin where an increased degradation of streptokinase was observed. Further, the in vitro site-directed mutagenesis of the three putative N-glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 14, 265, and 377 to alanine revealed the essentiality of glycosylation of the 14th amino acid residue in its post-translational proteolytic stability without significantly affecting its biological activity. However, the mutation of both Asn265 and Asn377 did not seem to contribute toward its glycosylation but resulted in a 39% lower specific activity in case of the rSK-N265,377A. Moreover, the mutation of all three glycosylation positions drastically reduced the secretory expression of native streptokinase from 347 to 186.6 mg/L for the triple mutant with a 14% lower specific activity of 56,738 IU/mg from 65,808 IU/mg. The secondary structure, tertiary structure, and thermal transition point (45-55 degrees C) of all the deglycosylated variants did not show any significant differences when compared with fully glycosylated native streptokinase using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, the longer acting plasmin-resistant variants were also developed via the mutation of lysine residues 59 and 386 to glutamine which enhanced its biological stability as a ~ 1.5-fold increase in the caseinolytic zone size was observed in case of rSK-K59Q and also in rSK-K59,386Q mutant without affecting the structural properties.</p></details></div>

On this scenario, the retention of such specific microorganisms in the system is of critical interest; however, the potential limitations of working with simplified cultures in a competitive open environment are neither fully explored nor well understood. In this work, a series of biofilters treating methanol vapors coupled with heterologous endochitinase production were used to evaluate the performance of a specialized microbial population during a typical open-to-environment operation. The biofilters were inoculated with a transformed strain of Pichia pastoris and were operated identically for about 90 days. The results showed that the biofiltration performance became diverse with time in terms of the elimination capacity (EC) shifting from a variation coefficient of 1.5% (EC = 274 +/- 24, 279 +/- 5, and 281.9 +/- 25 g/[m(3) h]) at the beginning of the operation to 33% (EC = 297 +/- 9, 338 +/- 7, and 341 +/- 2 g/[m(3) h]) at the end of operation. Epifluorescence analysis and cloning-sequencing suggested that P. pastoris remained as the dominant microorganism of methanol degradation, whereas diverse airborne bacteria, including Ochrobactrum spp. and Klebsiella oxytoca, played a secondary role possibly associated with the consumption of intermediates. Overall, this study found that low diversity systems operated under non-sterile conditions could be susceptible to contamination with external microorganisms causing a diversifying behavior at the performance and microbial community levels.

Herein, we demonstrate how the properties of a new manganese peroxidase from Moniliophthora roreri, designated MrMnP1, were shifted towards those of a versatile peroxidase. MrMnP1 was cloned in Pichia pastoris X-33 and highly expressed in a fed-batch fermentation, yielding 132 mg L(-1) of active enzyme. To extend the substrate spectrum of MrMnP1, a catalytically active tryptophan present in lignin and versatile peroxidases was first introduced. Additionally, the role of five amino acids at positions adjacent to the catalytic tryptophan was elucidated through their replacement by those found in a versatile peroxidase from Pleurotus eryngii.

We describe here the development of a novel system for the easy and fast expression of heterologous proteins both in S. cerevisiae and in P. pastoris, under the control of the GAL1 and AOX1 promoters respectively. Expression in S. cerevisiae requires only the transformation of yeast cells with an unpurified PCR product carrying the gene to be expressed, and the expression of the same gene in P. pastoris requires only the isolation of the plasmid generated in S. cerevisiae and its transformation into this second yeast, thus making this system suitable for high-throughput projects.

Structural comparison with the closest thermophilic endoglucanase homolog, Cel5A from Thermoascus aurantiacus, demonstrates disulfide bond differences. Replacement of Cysteine99 with Valine and Cysteine323 with Histidine by site directed mutagenesis caused elimination of two disulfide bonds. Recombinant expression in Pichia pastoris showed the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) increment toward CMC for single mutant enzymes, C99V and C323H, about 1.87 and 1.3 folded respectively. This indicates that the elimination of disulfide bond in substrate binding cleft around the catalytic domain of mutant EndoglucanaseII may be increased the flexibility of protein, to form a suitable E-S complex.

The success of this transition will require the development of genetically stable production strains, the use of strong constitutive promoters, and the development of new medium formulations that allow an appropriate balance between cell growth and product formation. We identified genes that showed high expression in Komagataella phaffii during different steady-state conditions and explored the utility of promoters of these genes (Chr1-4_0586 and FragB_0052) in optimizing the expression of two different r-proteins, human lysozyme (HuLy), and the anti-idiotypic antibody fragment, Fab-3H6, in comparison with the widely used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Our results showed that the promoter strength was highly dependent on the cultivation conditions and thus constructs should be tested under a range of conditions to determine both the best performing clone and the ideal promoter for the expression of the protein of interest. An important benefit of continuous production is that it facilitates the use of the genome-scale metabolic models in the design of strains and cultivation media. In silico flux distributions showed that production of either protein increased the flux through aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Tyrosine supplementation increased the productivity for both proteins, whereas tryptophan addition did not cause any significant change and, phenylalanine addition increased the expression of HuLy but decreased that of Fab-3H6. These results showed that a genome-scale metabolic model can be used to assess the metabolic burden imposed by the synthesis of a specific r-protein and then this information can be used to tailor a cultivation medium to increase production.</p></details></div>

A gene encoding an extracellular tyrosinase-like enzyme was amplified from the genome of Thermothelomyces thermophila and expressed in Pichia pastoris The recombinant enzyme (TtPPO) was purified and biochemically characterized. Its production reached 40 mg/liter, and it appeared to be a glycosylated and N-terminally processed protein. TtPPO showed broad substrate specificity, as it could oxidize 28/30 compounds tested, including polyphenols, substituted phenols, catechols, and methoxyphenols. Its optimum temperature was 65 degrees C, with a half-life of 18.3 h at 50 degrees C, while its optimum pH was 7.5. The homology model of TtPPO was constructed, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed in order to increase its activity on mono- and dichlorophenols (di-CPs). The G292N/Y296V variant of TtPPO 5.3-fold increased activity on 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-diCP) compared to the wild type.IMPORTANCE A novel fungal PPO was heterologously expressed and biochemically characterized. Construction of single and double mutants led to the generation of variants with altered specificity against CPs. Through this work, knowledge is gained regarding the effect of mutations on the substrate specificity of PPOs.

For this purpose, we suggested integrating non-affinity chromatographic methods of hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for cost-effective purification of rHBsAg expressed in P. pastoris. The optimization of such process is not trivial and straightforward since diverse molecular characteristics of expressed rHBsAg in each type of host cell cause different interactions in non-affinity chromatography processes.

The best result for lab-scale HIC was achieved by using ammonium sulfate buffer in 10% of saturation concentration in pH 7.0 with Butyl-S Sepharose 6 Fast Flow medium and with subsequent Tween-100 and urea elution. In this process, the recovery, purity, and total yield were about 84%, 82%, and 69%, respectively. By scaling-up the HIC and integrating it with Sephacryl S-400 SEC, we obtained highly pure, i.e., > 90%, rHBsAg virus-like particles (VLP).</p></details></div>

Our present study successfully constructs and expresses a fully human, bispecific, single-chain diabody (BsDb) that can bind to vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in Pichia pastoris. Under the optimal expression conditions (methanol concentration, 1%; pH, 4.0; inoculum density, OD600 = 4, and the induction time, 96 h), the maximum production level of this BsDb is achieved at approximately 20 mg/L. The recombinant BsDb is purified in one step using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column chromatography with a purity of more than 95%. Indirect enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) and sandwich ELISA analyses show that purified BsDb can bind specifically to VEGF165 and PD-1 simultaneously with affinities of 124.78 nM and 25.07 nM, respectively. Additionally, the BsDb not only effectively inhibits VEGF165-stimulated proliferation, migration, and tube formation in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but also significantly improves proliferation and INF-gamma production of activated T cells by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 co-stimulation. Furthermore, the BsDb displays potent antitumor activity in mice bearing HT29 xenograft tumors by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and activating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Based on these results, we have prepared a potential bispecific antibody drug that can co-target both VEGF165 and PD-1 for the first time. This work provides a stable foundation for the development of new strategies by the combination of an angiogenesis inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade for cancer therapy.</p></details></div>

In the present work, Lcc9 cDNA was cloned from C. cinerea using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant laccase was found to be a heavily hyperglycoprotein, with the molecular weight of 60.2kDa as determined by MALDI-TOF. Laccase activity in the culture supernatant was 1750+/-83 U/L and reached 3138+/-62 U/L after expression condition optimization using orthogonal experiment. The biochemical property of the purified recombinant Lcc9 (rLcc9) was compared to that of wild-type Lcc9. rLcc9 shows a higher specific activity (315.3 U/mg) than Lcc9 (92.9 U/mg) when using ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sulfonate)) as the substrate. Although rLcc9 and Lcc9 showed comparable optimal pH (6.5) and temperature (70 degrees C) toward syringaldazine, rLcc9 displayed higher activity and stability in the pH range of 6.5-8.5. rLcc9 showed improved ability to oxidize indigo carmine and 5 azo dyes when methyl syringate was used as the mediator, with the decolorization rate range from 71.9+/-3.2% to 99.1+/-1.6% for different dyes in a wide pH (4.5-9.0) and temperature (4-70 degrees C) ranges. In comparison, Lcc9 decolorized 50.3+/-2.1% to 98.2+/-2.0% of the dyes used. The improved activity and stability in alkaline pH of rLcc9 relative to Lcc9, and improved dye decolorization ability towards 6 dyes suggested greater application potential of rLcc9 in biotechnologies such as wastewater treatment.</p></details></div>

Here, the results of an extensive mutagenesis study on three LPMO representatives, Phanerochaete chrysosporium LPMO9D (C1-oxidizer), Neurospora crassa LPMO9C (C4), and Hypocrea jecorina LPMO9A (C1/C4), are reported. Using a previously published indicator diagram, the authors demonstrate that several structural determinants of LPMOs play an important role in their oxidative regioselectivity. N-glycan removal and alterations of the aromatic residues on the substrate-binding surface are shown to alter C1/C4-oxidation ratios. Removing the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) is found not to alter the regioselectivity of HjLPMO9A, although the effect of mutational changes is shown to increase in a CBM-free context. The accessibility to the solvent-exposed axial position of the copper-site reveales not to be a major regioselectivity indicator, at least not in PcLPMO9D. Interestingly, a HjLPMO9A variant lacking two surface exposed aromatic residues combines decreased binding capacity with a 22% increase in synergetic efficiency. Similarly to recent LPMO10 findings, our results suggest a complex matrix of surface-interactions that enables LPMO9s not only to bind their substrate, but also to accurately direct their oxidative force.</p></details></div>

Here we describe the production, purification and characterization of Bacillus licheniformis chitinase A in the Pichia pastoris expression system. Optimal enzyme activity occurred at pH 4.0-5.0 and within the temperature range 50-60 degrees C.

Thus, FGEs are capable of degrading lignin-carbohydrate complexes and have potential for biotechnological applications toward woody biomass utilization. Therefore, identification and characterization of new FGEs are of critical importance. Firstly, in this study, we built a phylogenetic tree from almost 400 putative FGEs obtained on BLAST analysis and defined six main clades. In the phylogenetic tree, all the putative FGEs of ascomycetes cluster in clades I to IV, and most of the putative FGEs of basidiomycetes (B-FGEs) cluster in clades V to VI. Interestingly, several B-FGEs were found to cluster in clade II; most FGEs of clade II were found to have higher theoretical isoelectric points than those in the other five clades. To gain an insight into the putative FGEs in the clades that have not been characterized yet, we chose the FGEs of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora (CsGE) and Pleurotus eryngii (PeGE), which belong to clades V and II, respectively. The catalytic domains of both CsGE and PeGE were successfully expressed using Pichia pastoris, and then purified. Benzyl glucuronic acid was used as a substrate to confirm the activities of the CsGE and PeGE, and the hydrolyzed product, glucuronic acid, was quantified spectrophotometrically. Both CsGE and PeGE clearly exhibited the esterase activity.

Heterogeneous expression of beta-mannanase in Pichia pastoris systems is widely used; however, Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression systems are more reliable and safer. We optimized beta-mannanase gene from Aspergillus sulphureus and expressed it in five S. cerevisiae strains. Haploid and diploid strains, and strains with constitutive promoter TEF1 or inducible promoter GAL1, were tested for enzyme expression in synthetic auxotrophic or complex medium. Highest efficiency expression was observed for haploid strain BY4741 integrated with beta-mannanase gene under constitutive promoter TEF1, cultured in complex medium. In fed-batch culture in a fermentor, enzyme activity reached ~ 24 U/mL after 36 h, and production efficiency reached 16 U/mL/day. Optimal enzyme pH was 2.0-7.0, and optimal temperature was 60 degrees C. In studies of beta-mannanase kinetic parameters for two substrates, locust bean gum galactomannan (LBG) gave Km = 24.13 mg/mL and Vmax = 715 U/mg, while konjac glucomannan (KGM) gave Km = 33 mg/mL and Vmax = 625 U/mg. One-hour hydrolysis efficiency values were 57% for 1% LBG, 74% for 1% KGM, 39% for 10% LBG, and 53% for 10% KGM. HPLC analysis revealed that the major hydrolysis products were the oligosaccharides mannose, mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, mannopentaose, and mannohexaose. Our findings show that this beta-mannanase has high efficiency for hydrolysis of mannans to mannooligosaccharides, a type of prebiotic, suggesting strong potential application in food industries.</p></details></div>

Comparison of amino acid sequences of fucosidases reveals that although the nucleophile is conserved among all alpha-l-fucosidases, the position of the acid/base residue is quite variable. Although several site-directed mutation studies have previously been performed on bacterial fucosidases, the only eukaryotic fucosidase so studied was the human fucosidase. Recent alignments indicate that human and Arthropoda alpha-l-fucosidases share at least 50% identity and the acid/base residue seems to be conserved among them suggesting a common acid/base residue in Metazoa. Here we describe the cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris of a very active alpha-l-fucosidase from the spider Nephilingis cruentata (NcFuc) with a Km value for pNPFuc of 0.4 mM. NcFuc hydrolyzed fucoidan, 2 fucosyllactose and also lacto-N-difucohexaose II. Mutants modified at the conserved residues D214N, E209A, E59A were expressed and characterized. The 500-fold lower kcat of D214N than the wild type was consistent with a role in catalysis, as was the 8000-fold lower kcat value of E59A. This was supported by the 57-fold increase in the kcat of E59A upon addition of azide. A complex pH/rate profile was seen for the wild-type and mutant forms of NcFuc, similar to those measured previously for the Sulfolobus fucosidase. The non-conservative catalytic structure and distinct active site organization reinforce the necessity of structural studies of new fucosidases.</p></details></div>

(+)-Ambrein is a major component of ambergris, an intestinal excretion of sperm whales that is found only serendipitously. Thus, the demand for (-)-ambrox is currently mainly met by chemical synthesis. A recent study described for the first time the applicability of an enzyme cascade consisting of two terpene cyclases, namely squalene-hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AaSHC D377C) and tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene cyclase from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTC) for in vitro (+)-ambrein production starting from squalene. Yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris, are natural producers of squalene and have already been shown in the past to be excellent hosts for the biosynthesis of hydrophobic compounds such as terpenoids. By targeting a central enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, squalene epoxidase Erg1, intracellular squalene levels in P. pastoris could be strongly enhanced. Heterologous expression of AaSHC D377C and BmeTC and, particularly, development of suitable methods to analyze all products of the engineered strain provided conclusive evidence of whole-cell (+)-ambrein production. Engineering of BmeTC led to a remarkable one-enzyme system that was by far superior to the cascade, thereby increasing (+)-ambrein levels approximately 7-fold in shake flask cultivation. Finally, upscaling to 5L bioreactor yielded more than 100mgL(-1) of (+)-ambrein, demonstrating that metabolically engineered yeast P. pastoris represents a valuable, whole-cell system for high-level production of (+)-ambrein.</p></details></div>

Available model analysis applied to this dual-limited condition is scarce and normally does not consider the interaction effects between the substrates. In this work, a dual-limited growth model of P. pastoris considering an interactive kinetic effect was applied to an optimised fed-batch process production of heterologous Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL). In the proposed model, the growth kinetics on glycerol is fully expressed, whereas methanol kinetics is modulated by the co-metabolisation of glycerol, resulting in an enhancing effect of glycerol-specific growth rate. The modelling approach of fed-batch cultures also included the methanol volatilisation caused by the aeration that was found to be a not-negligible phenomenon. The model predicts the ability of P. pastoris to keep control of the methanol concentration in the broth during ROL-optimised production process in fed batch and fits satisfactorily the specific cell growth rate and ROL production. Implications of interaction effect are discussed applying the general procedure of modelling approach.</p></details></div>

Most heterologous P domains expressed in Escherichia coli or Komagataella pastoris (formally known as Pichia pastoris) form P particles consisting of 24 P monomers formed through intermolecular contact in the P regions and an end-linked cysteine tag. The small P particle is only found in P domains with terminal modifications. In this study, the NoV P domain of the most predominant NoV strain GII.4 isolated from Taiwan was expressed in K. pastoris. A high yield of NoV P was obtained using the high-cell density fermentation process in K. pastoris. A large amount of the small P particles and the trimer and dimer complexes formed by 12, 6, and 2 P monomers were observed in both the expression of the NoV P-His and P containing cysteine tag at the N-terminus. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy analysis of the purified NoV P-His and P revealed that most of these small P particles are triangle-, square-, and ring-shaped with a diameter of 14-15 nm. The binding ability of purified NoV P-His and P to human histo-blood group antigen was confirmed by a saliva-binding assay. Without terminal modification, small P particles were formed in our study. The amino acid sequence analysis showed only four different amino acids (residue 84, 119, 136, and 313) between the P domain in this study and other investigated GII.4 strains suggesting that these amino acids might play an important role in the P particle formation. The small P particles formed by the Taiwan-native norovirus P domain overexpressed in K. pastoris may provide further information for morphogenesis studies and vaccine development.</p></details></div>

Here, we demonstrate that the Rtg1p/Rtg3p-mediated retrograde signaling pathway is absent in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris We observed that P. pastoris Rtg1p (PpRtg1p) heterodimerizes with S. cerevisiae Rtg3p and functions as a nuclear, retrograde transcription factor in S. cerevisiae, but not in P. pastoris. We noted that P. pastoris Rtg3p lacks a functional leucine zipper and interacts with neither S. cerevisiae Rtg1p (ScRtg1p) nor PpRtg1p. In the absence of an interaction with Rtg3p, PpRtg1p has apparently acquired a novel function as a cytosolic regulator of multiple P. pastoris metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of glutamate dehydrogenase 2 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase required for the utilization of glutamate as the sole carbon source. PpRtg1p also had an essential role in methanol metabolism and regulated alcohol oxidase synthesis and was required for the metabolism of ethanol, acetate, and oleic acid, but not of glucose and glycerol. Although PpRtg1p could functionally complement ScRtg1p, ScRtg1p could not complement PpRtg1p, indicating that ScRtg1p is not a functional PpRtg1p homolog. Thus, PpRtg1p functions as a nuclear, retrograde transcription factor in S. cerevisiae and as a cytosolic, post-transcriptional regulator in P. pastoris We conclude that PpRtg1p is a key component of a signaling pathway that regulates multiple metabolic processes in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

We present a gradient network generator microfluidic device for dose-dependent testing of toxicity of CDs to a unicellular eukaryotic model organism, yeast Pichia pastoris. We fully characterized the microfluidic model and compare its performance with a conventional method. The gradient generator increased the contact area between the mixing species and enabled a high-throughput testing of CDs in a wide range of concentrations in cell chambers. Real time monitoring of yeast cell proliferation in the presence of CDs showed dose-dependent growth inhibition and various budding cell shape profiles. Comparing the result of microfluidic platform and conventional method revealed statistically significant differences in the proliferation rate of the cells between the two platforms. To understand the toxicity mechanism, we studied binding of CDs to P. pastoris and found increasing interactions of CDs with the cell surface at CDs larger concentrations.

However, neither the alpha-galactosidase encoding gene in coconut nor the mutation type has been identified and characterized in normal and curd coconuts. In this study, cDNA and genomic DNA encoding alpha-galactosidase gene alleles from a normal and two curd coconuts were successfully cloned and characterized. The deduced amino acid of wild type alpha-galactosidase contains 398 amino acid residues with a 17N-terminal amino acids signal peptide sequence. Three mutant alleles, the first 19-amino acids from 67 to 85 (ADALVSTGLARLGYQYVNL) deletion with S137R and the second R216T, were identified from curd coconut plant no.1 while the third P250R was identified from curd coconut plant no. 10. All mutations of alpha-galactosidase gene were confirmed by the analysis of parental genomic DNA from normal and curd coconuts. Heterologous expression in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) indicated that recombinant P250R, R216T and 19-amino acids deletion-S137R mutant proteins showed no alpha-galactosidase activity. Only the recombinant wild-type protein was able to detect for alpha-galactosidase activity. These results are in accordance with the no detection of alpha-galactosidase activity in developing curd coconut endosperms by tissue staining. While, the accumulation of enzyme activity was present in the solid endosperm of normal coconut. The full-length cDNA and parental genomic DNA sequences encoding alpha-galactosidase in normal coconut as well as identified curd coconut mutant alleles are reported in Genbank accession no. KJ957156 and KM001681-3. Transcription level of the alpha-galactosidase gene in mature curd coconut endosperm was at least 20 times higher than normal. In conclusion, absence of alpha-galactosidase activity caused by gene mutations associates with an accumulation of oligogalactomannan in endosperms, resulting in curd coconut phenotype.</p></details></div>

In all 78 copies of major vault protein (MVP) assemble on polyribosome templates, forming recombinant vault particles, which are of great interest as encapsulation carriers for therapeutics delivery and enzyme stabilization. Baculovirus-insect cell expression is the only system that has been developed for recombinant vault synthesis, but it has low scalability and slow production rate. In this study, we demonstrated the first use of yeast cells for the production of vault particles with full integrity and functionality solely by expressing the complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding MVP. Vaults synthesized in Pichia pastoris yeast cells are morphologically indistinguishable from recombinant vault particles produced in insect cells, and are able to package and stabilize enzymes resulting in improved longevity and catalytic efficiency. Thus, our results imply that the yeast system is an economical alternative to insect cells for the production of recombinant vaults. The consistency of vault morphology between yeast and insect cell systems also underlines that polyribosome templating may be conserved among eukaryotes, which promises the synthesis and assembly of recombinant human vault particles in other eukaryotic organisms.</p></details></div>

In this work, the gene coding for a novel xylanase (XynC) belonging to family 30 of the glycoside hydrolases (GH), has been identified in the genome of the fungus. The enzyme has been expressed in Pichia pastoris and characterized. The mature XynC has 454 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular weight of 49240. The purified protein shows a molecular weight of 67000, and it is partially deglycosylated using EndoH. Its pH optimum is in the range of 3-5, and the optimal temperature is 45 degrees C. It is active on both arabinoxylan and glucuronoxylan, similarly to other fungal GH 30 xylanases. It liberates a set of oligosaccharides, which have been detected by thin-layer chromatography, thus indicating that it is an endo-acting xylanase. It hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides, releasing mainly xylobiose, in contrast to other fungal GH family 30 enzymes which generate chiefly xylose. Highest sequence identity to a characterized family 30 xylanase is found with the enzyme from the fungus Bispora sp (53%).

Recombinant yeast-derived FSH offers a practical alternative; however, the heterologous expression efficiency remains disappointingly low. To improve FSH production in Pichia pastoris, a series of molecular strategies, together with fermentation optimization, were tested in the present study. By comparing clones of the Mut(s) phenotype strain, it was observed that the yield of soluble pFSH increased by approximately 96% in clones of the Mut(+) phenotype strain. The protein levels of soluble pFSHbeta, which confers biological specificity, increased by approximately 143 and 22% after two kinds of codon optimization strategies, respectively. Moreover, compared with the production of soluble pFSHbeta and SUMO-pFSHbeta, the production of soluble protein HSA-pFSHbeta was significantly improved. Furthermore, the optimum pH and methanol concentration for expressing soluble HSA-pFSH in strain H3-3 were determined as 5.0-6.0 and 1.5-2% in shake-flask, and the yield of soluble HSA-pFSH could reach 40.8 mg/l after purification. In vitro bioactivity assays showed that recombinant HSA-pFSH could efficiently stimulate cAMP synthesis in HEK293 cells expressing porcine FSHR. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the application of phenotypic selection of aox1 mutants, combined with codon optimization, the choice of fusion partners, and fermentation optimization, considerably increased the yield of pFSH in supernatant of P. pastoris and thus provided a valuable reference for the large-scale recombinant expression of pFSH.</p></details></div>

The development of a mutant VEGF165b with a prolonged half-life is urgently needed for its future application. A mutant VEGF165b was generated by inactivation of its plasmin cleavage site. The mutant and native VEGF165b proteins without purification tags were expressed via the Pichia pastoris expression system followed by purification with a HiTrap heparin affinity chromatography column through optimization of the purification conditions. Furthermore, its binding affinity with VEGF Receptors and its functions in vitro and in vivo were examined. Results showed that the half-life of mutant VEGF165b increased to approximately 10 times (Intravenous), 9.1 times (Intraperitoneal) and 5.4 times (Subcutaneous) greater than that of VEGF165b, and the mutation did not cause significant alteration of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 binding affinity. Mutant VEGF165b inhibited the proliferation and migration of HUVECs in vitro, similar to the native VEGF165b. In a mouse melanoma model, mutant VEGF165b exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity in comparison with its native counterpart. These results indicate that the mutant VEGF165b had a prolonged half-life and retained the anti-angiogenic activity of the native VEGF165b, suggesting that this novel mutant VEGF165b may be a stronger anti-cancer agent.</p></details></div>

This relatively new class of binding scaffold has various advantages: i) it has a single peptide composition, amenable to molecular engineering for enhancing its stability and affinity; ii) it has a small size, contributing better tissue penetration and easier production using microorganism expression system. Monomeric arVLRB142, which can specifically bind to the glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), was expressed in Pichia pastoris. High quantity recombinant monomeric arVLRB142 (rVLR142(mono)) was purified from 100ml of culture with a resulting yield of 2.6+/-1.3mg of target protein. Functional studies revealed that the purified rVLR142(mono) can specifically recognize low levels of the target antigen (recombinant glycoprotein) (i.e. as low as 0.1nM), but also the native glycoprotein of VHSV. The expressed rVLR142(mono) exhibited high levels of stability and it retained it binding capacity over broad temperature (4 degrees C~60 degrees C) and pH ranges (pH1.5-12.5). We developed an effective expression system for mass production of monomeric VLRB based on P. pastoris.

The specific activities of TaCel45 towards lichenin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na), and barley beta-glucan were 769, 498, and 486 U/mg protein, respectively, which are higher than the values for all other reported GH45 cellulases. TaCel45 had maximum activity at pH 5.0-6.0 and 60-65 degrees C with barley beta-glucan and CMC-Na as substrates and had a melting temperature (Tm) of 68.4 degrees C. However, TaCel45 exhibited extraordinary thermostability at 90 and 100 degrees C, retaining more than 70 and 45% of its activity after a 1-h incubation, respectively. Seven mutants (C11S, C12S, C16S, C31S, C171S, C193S, and C203S) were then constructed to investigate the effects of each disulfide bond on the structure, activity, and stability of TaCel45. As a result, six disulfide bonds (C11-C136, C16-C87, C31-C57, C88-C203, C90-C193, and C160-Cy171) were found to be indispensable for the folding, secretion, and activity of TaCel45, while C12-C48 was critical for thermal adaptation and refolding. The mutant C12S showed decreased optimal temperature and Tm values of 50 and 60.2 degrees C, respectively, and retained less than 50% of the thermal refolding ability of the wild type.

AFP from Aspergillus giganteus represents the hallmark of this still increasing family of antifungal polypeptides. Close in silico analyses of the Fusarium graminearum genome revealed the presence of an AFP-like peptide, here designated as FgAFP. This new peptide was cloned, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and characterized. The results obtained showed its strong and specific antifungal activity against several well-recognized maize pathogens, but inefficacy against F. oxysporum, which has not been described as a natural biological competitor of other fungal pathogens assayed.

The MIP protein can be detected by dot-blot analysis from the culture broth of P. pastoris KM71H 24h after placement in MMH induction medium. The secretion levels of MIP protein in culture broth at 72h after induction indicated that P. pastoris KM71H with one cassette of the MIP gene had highest MIP protein levels (4.19+/-0.96mgL(-1)). The transcription levels of the MIP gene increased proportionately with copy number. However, the amount of secreted MIP protein showed no correlation. The MIP molecular mass was 5756.951Da, as confirmed by typical MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MIP protein in culture broth was purified by two steps purification including SP Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography followed by ultrafiltration (10kDaMW cutoff). The percentage of MIP recovery after the two-step purification was 70%, with a single band in a native-PAGE.

Insertion of multiple 2As within a single open reading frame (ORF) produces multiple proteins; hence, 2As have been used in a very wide range of biotechnological and biomedical applications. During translation, these 2A peptide sequences mediate a eukaryote-specific, self-"cleaving" event, termed "ribosome skipping" with very high efficiency. A particular advantage of using 2As is the ability to simultaneously translate a number of proteins at an equal level in all eukaryotic systems although, naturally, final steady-state levels depend upon other factors-notably protein stability. By contrast, the use of internal ribosome entry site elements for co-expression results in an unbalanced expression due to the relative inefficiency of internal initiation. For example, a 1:1 ratio is of particular importance for the biosynthesis of the heavy-chain and light-chain components of antibodies: highly valuable as therapeutic proteins. Furthermore, each component of these "artificial polyprotein" systems can be independently targeted to different sub-cellular sites. The potential of this system was vividly demonstrated by concatenating multiple gene sequences, linked via 2A sequences, into a single, long, ORF-a polycistronic construct. Here, ORFs comprising the biosynthetic pathways for violacein (five gene sequences) and beta-carotene (four gene sequences) were concatenated into a single cistron such that all components were co-expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. In this review, we provide useful information on 2As to serve as a guide for future utilities of this co-expression technology in basic research, biotechnology, and clinical applications.</p></details></div>

Moreover, the active site of the Pep4um has the two characteristic aspartic acid residues of aspartyl proteases. The pep4um gene was cloned, expressed in Pichia pastoris and a 54 kDa recombinant protein was observed. Pep4um-rec was confirmed to be an aspartic protease by specifically inhibiting its enzymatic activity with pepstatin A. Pep4um-rec enzymatic activity on acidic hemoglobin was optimal at pH 4.0 and at 40 degrees C. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report about the heterologous expression of an aspartic protease from a basidiomycete. An in-depth in silico analysis suggests that Pep4um is homolog of the human cathepsin D protein.

Injection of purified rBjalphaIT induced neurotoxicity symptoms in locust (Locusta migratoria) larvae, and the half-lethal dose of rBjalphaIT for locusts at 24-h post-injection ranged from 11 to 14mug/g body weight. These results demonstrated that large amounts of active rBjalphaIT were efficiently prepared from P. pastoris, suggesting this system as efficacious for determining rBjalphaIT insecticidal activity against other agricultural insect pests.</p></details></div>

Xu et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 84  (2018).</p> <span itemprop="datePublished"><p>Publication date: 2018 Oct 1</p></span> <span itemprop="url"><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054355>pubmed link</a></p></span> <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-beta-d-glucuronide (GAMG), which possesses a higher sweetness and stronger pharmacological activity than those of glycyrrhizin (GL), can be obtained by removal of the distal glucuronic acid (GlcA) from GL. In this study, we isolated a beta-glucuronidase (TpGUS79A) from the filamentous fungus Talaromyces pinophilus Li-93 that can specifically and precisely convert GL to GAMG without the formation of the by-product glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) from the further hydrolysis of GAMG. First, TpGUS79A was purified and identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-tandem time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) and deglycosylation, indicating that TpGUS79A is a highly N-glycosylated monomeric protein with a molecular mass of around 85 kDa, including around 25 kDa of glycan moiety. The gene for TpGUS79A was then cloned and verified by heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris TpGUS79A belonged to glycoside hydrolase family 79 (GH79) but shared low amino acid sequence identity (<35%) with the available GH79 GUS enzymes. TpGUS79A had strict specificity toward the glycan moiety but poor specificity toward the aglycone moiety. Interestingly, TpGUS79A recognized and hydrolyzed the distal glucuronic bond of GL but could not cleave the glucuronic bond in GAMG. TpGUS79A showed a much higher catalytic efficiency on GL (kcat/Km of 11.14 mM(-1) s(-1)) than on the artificial substrate pNP beta-glucopyranosiduronic acid (kcat/Km of 0.01 mM(-1) s(-1)), which is different from the case for most GUSs. Homology modeling, substrate docking, and sequence alignment were employed to identify the key residues for substrate recognition. Finally, a fed-batch fermentation in a 150-liter fermentor was established to prepare GAMG through GL hydrolysis by T. pinophilus Li-93. Therefore, TpGUS79A is potentially a powerful biocatalyst for environmentally friendly and cost-effective production of GAMG.IMPORTANCE Compared to chemical methods, the biotransformation of glycyrrhizin (GL) into glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-beta-d-glucuronide (GAMG), which has a higher sweetness and stronger pharmacological activity than those of GL, via catalysis by beta-glucuronidase is an environmentally friendly approach due to the mild reaction conditions and the high yield of GAMG. However, currently available GUSs show low substrate specificity toward GL and further hydrolyze GAMG to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) as a by-product, increasing the difficulty of subsequent separation and purification. In the present study, we succeeded in isolating a novel beta-glucuronidase (named TpGUS79A) from Talaromyces pinophilus Li-93 that specifically hydrolyzes GL to GAMG without the formation of GA. TpGUS79A also shows higher activity on GL than those of the previously characterized GUSs. Moreover, the gene for TpGUS79A was cloned and its function verified by heterologous expression in P. pastoris Therefore, TpGUS79A can serve as a powerful biocatalyst for the cost-effective production of GAMG through GL transformation.</p></details></div>

After expression in Pichia pastoris GS115, the purified recombinant BisGlu16B showed maximal activity at pH 4.0 and 55 degrees C and had broad substrate specificity (beta-1,3-/beta-1,4-mixed, beta-1,3-, beta-1,4-, and beta-1,6-linked glucan, and beta-1,4-mannan). The enzyme possessed high specific activities toward barley beta-glucan (34700 U.mg(-1)), lichenan (23900 U.mg(-1)), and laminarin (9000 U.mg(-1)). After removing the C-terminal module, the truncated mutant, BisGlu16B-DeltaC, retained similar enzymatic properties to the wild type but displayed significantly enhanced activities (up to 2.5-fold). Functional and structural analyses indicated that the C-terminal module plays a key role in the substrate binding of BisGlu16B.

The use of methanol has major drawbacks, so there is a demand for alternative promoters with good induction properties such as the glucose-regulated P GTH1 promoter which we reported recently. To further increase its potential, we investigated its regulation in more details by the screening of promoter variants harboring deletions and mutations. Thereby we could identify the main regulatory region and important putative transcription factor binding sites of P GTH1 . Concluding from that, yeast metabolic regulators, monomeric Gal4-class motifs, carbon source-responsive elements, and yeast GC-box proteins likely contribute to the regulation of the promoter. We engineered a P GTH1 variant with greatly enhanced induction properties compared with that of the wild-type promoter. Based on that, a model-based bioprocess design for high volumetric productivity in a limited time was developed for the P GTH1 variant, to employ a glucose fed-batch strategy that clearly outperformed a classical methanol fed-batch of a P AOX1 strain in terms of titer and process performance.</p></details></div>

The relatively lower gene targeting efficiency observed in this species occurs due to high levels of non-homologous recombination activity. In the current study, we explored the function of the K. phaffii homolog of DNA ligase IV (Dnl4p) by creating a DNL4-disrupted strain. To assess the roles of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-related proteins in this species, strains deleted for either or both genes encoding Dnl4p or the telomeric Ku complex subunit (Ku70p) were generated. These deletions were constructed by either of two distinct marker-recycling methods (yielding either a seamless gene deletion or a Cre-loxP-mediated gene deletion). The resulting dnl4- and/or ku70-deleted K. phaffii strains were used to evaluate gene targeting efficiency in gene knock-out and gene knock-in experiments. The Dnl4p-defective strain showed improved gene targeting efficiency for homologous recombination compared to the wild-type and Ku70p-deffective strains. The dnl4 ku70 double knock-out strain exhibited a further improvement in gene targeting efficiency. Thus, the K. phaffii dnl4 and dnl4 ku70 deletion strains are expected to serve as useful platforms for functional analysis and strain development in this species.</p></details></div>

BAF180 is the chromatin-targeting subunit of the PBAF complex. BAF180 has six bromodomains, two BAH domains, and one HMG box. Bromodomains are known to recognize acetylated-lysines on histones and play a role in nucleosome recognition. BAH domains are required for ubiquitination of PCNA, a key regulator of DNA damage. The putative HMG box, if functional, may be involved in DNA-binding. While the binding specificities of individual bromodomains have been studied by our lab and others, the results have failed to reach a consensus. The acetyl-histone binding features of the full-length protein is unknown and is the motivation for this work. The hypothetical HMG and BAH domains have not been studied and the actual function of these regions is currently unknown. Thus, the precise interactions of this large and complex protein are not well-studied. Advances in understanding this large protein have been hindered by the inability to express and purify recombinant full-length BAF180 protein. Currently, only phenomenological studies using BAF180 expressed in mammalian cells have been conducted. Here, we report the successful expression, purification of full-length biologically active BAF180 protein using the GAP promoter in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris. The ability to express full-length and mutated BAF180 will allow for biophysical binding studies.

They have been emerged as important tools in optogenetics where light is used to trigger a change in the membrane potential of live cells which induces downstream physiological cascades. There is also increased interest in their applications for generating light-responsive biomaterials. Here we have used a two-step screening protocol to develop a Pichia pastoris strain that produces superior yields of an enhance variant of CaChR2 (from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), called ChIEF. We have also studied the effect of the co-factor, namely all-trans retinal (ATR), on the recombinant overexpression, folding, and function of the protein. We found that both ChIEF-mCitrine and CaChR2 can be overexpressed and properly trafficked to the plasma membrane in yeast regardless of the presence of the ATR. The purified protein was reconstituted into large unilamellar lipid vesicle using the detergent-assisted method. Using 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) as the fluorescent proton indicator, we have developed a flux assay to verify the light-activated proton flux in the ChIEF-mCitrine vesicles. Hence such vesicles are effectively light-responsive nano-compartments.

Only a few microorganisms are industrially relevant for recombinant protein production: methylotrophic yeasts are known to use methanol efficiently as the sole carbon and energy source. Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast characterized as being an economical, fast and effective system for heterologous protein expression. Many factors can affect both the product and the production, including the promoter, carbon source, pH, production volume, temperature, and many others; but to control all of them most of the time is difficult and this depends on the initial selection of each variable. Therefore, this review focuses on the selection of the best promoter in the recombination process, considering different inductors, and the temperature as a culture medium variable in methylotrophic Pichia pastoris yeast. The goal is to understand the effects associated with different factors that influence its cell metabolism and to reach the construction of an expression system that fulfills the requirements of the yeast, presenting an optimal growth and development in batch, fed-batch or continuous cultures, and at the same time improve its yield in heterologous protein production.</p></details></div>

The recombinant CTendo7 enzyme was purified by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography and subsequently characterized. CTendo7 belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 7, and exhibited considerable activity against sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) and xylan of 1.91IU/mg and 3.05IU/mg at the optimum reaction condition of 55 degrees C, pH5.0, respectively. The purified enzyme displayed relatively good thermostability. The residual endoglucanase and xylanase activities were 74.3% and 66.2% after a 60min pre-incubation at 70 degrees C. Additionally, Ag(+), Fe(3+) and Cu(2+) negatively affected the enzyme's activity, while the presence of 1mM and 5mM Mn(2+) significantly enhanced both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. Generation of soluble oligosaccharides from lignocellulose is a critical step in bioethanol production, and it is noteworthy that CTendo7 produced cello-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides from the continuous enzymatic saccharification of CMC-Na and xylan, respectively. This is the first detailed report on a novel bifunctional endoglucanase/xylanase enzyme from C. thermophilum. Furthermore, the excellent properties of CTendo7 distinguish it as a promising candidate for industrial lignocellulosic biomass conversion.</p></details></div>

The O-mannosylation is essential for its biological function in the process of colonization and invasion of host cells by M. tuberculosis. In this work, the gene encoding Apa was cloned from M. tuberculosis and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. In shake-flasks, the recombinant Apa was secreted into the culture media and purified with a yield of 0.6g/L. Both N- and O-glycans were found in recombinant Apa. In P. pastoris the known M. tuberculosis-derived O-glycosites of Apa were modified with short chains of mannose units, and a few additional glycosylation sites were also observed. Therefore, the recombinant Apa expressed in P. pastoris has similar but not identical O-mannose patterns to the native protein from M. tuberculosis. P. pastoris and mycobacteria share similarities in the protein O-glycosylation pathway. Thus P. pastoris could be a potential powerful expression system to produce mycobacteria-derived glycoproteins.</p></details></div>

It has been reported that Legumain is highly expressed in many human tumors and promotes the migratory and invasive activity of cancer cells. Due to the limitation of an abundant and affordable source of endogenous active Legumain for further function studies, we produced the recombinant protein in Pichia pastoris. The pPICZalpha-LGMN expression plasmid was constructed and transformed into Pichia pastoris strain and positive recombinants were identified. Fermentation conditions were optimized and it was found that Legumain was most highly expressed under pH 6 culture conditions. In addition, the enzyme activity of the purified Legumain was tested using a fluorogenic substrate (Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC) assay and the optimum pH for the autocatalytic activation of recombinant Legumain was very acidic at a pH value of 3. The recombinant protein was then used to screen a library of compounds and small molecule 1773 (Terramycin) was shown to effectively inhibit Legumain enzyme activity. These results indicate that the Pichia pastoris expression system can produce highly active recombinant Legumain protein allowing it to be used for High-throughput screening (HTS) applications.</p></details></div>

Cysteine proteases (CPs) are acknowledged as virulence factors in Giardia but their specific role in the molecular pathogenesis of disease is not known. Herein, we aimed to characterize the three main secreted CPs (CP14019, CP16160 and CP16779), which were identified by mass spectrometry in the medium during interaction with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro. First, the CPs were epitope-tagged and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures. Second, we showed that recombinant CPs, expressed in Pichia pastoris, are more active in acidic environment (pH 5.5-6) and we determined the kinetic parameters using fluorogenic substrates. Third, excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) from Giardia trophozoites affect the localization of apical junctional complex (AJC) proteins and recombinant CPs cleave or re-localize the AJC proteins (claudin-1 and -4, occludin, JAM-1, beta-catenin and E-cadherin) of IECs. Finally, we showed that the ESPs and recombinant CPs can degrade several chemokines, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, IL-8, CCL2, and CCL20, which are up-regulated in IECs during Giardia-host cell interactions. This is the first study that characterizes the role of specific CPs secreted from Giardia and our results collectively indicate their roles in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and modulating immune responses during Giardia infections.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp.) has been increasingly employed as a platform to produce metabolites of varying origin. We summarize here the impressive methodological developments of the last years to model and analyze the metabolism of P. pastoris, and to engineer its genome and metabolic pathways. Efficient methods to insert, modify or delete genes via homologous recombination and CRISPR/Cas9, supported by modular cloning techniques, have been reported. An outstanding early example of metabolic engineering in P. pastoris was the humanization of protein glycosylation. More recently the cell metabolism was engineered also to enhance the productivity of heterologous proteins. The last few years have seen an increased number of metabolic pathway design and engineering in P. pastoris, mainly towards the production of complex (secondary) metabolites. In this review, we discuss the potential role of P. pastoris as a platform for metabolic engineering, its strengths, and major requirements for future developments of chassis strains based on synthetic biology principles.</p></details></div>

Application of lignin degrading enzymes on the lignocellulosic biomass exposes the cellulose for easy digestion by ruminants. Laccases have been found to be considerably effective in improving the digestibility by way of delignification. However, laccase yields from natural hosts are not sufficient for industrial scale applications, which restricts their use. A viable option would be to express the laccase gene in compatible hosts to achieve higher production yields. A codon-optimized synthetic variant of Schizophyllum commune laccase gene was cloned into a pPIC9K vector and expressed in P. pastoris GS115 (his4) under the control of an alcohol oxidase promoter. Colonies were screened for G418 resistance and the methanol utilization phenotype was established. The transformant yielded a laccase activity of 344 U.mL(-1) after 5 days of growth at 30 degrees C (0.019 g.mL(-1) wet cell weight). The laccase protein produced by the recombinant Pichia clone was detected as two bands with apparent molecular weights of 55 kDa and 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Activity staining on native PAGE confirmed the presence of bioactive laccase. Treatment of five common crop residues with recombinant laccase recorded a lignin loss ranging between 1.64% in sorghum stover, to 4.83% in finger millet, with an enhancement in digestibility ranging between 8.71% in maize straw to 24.61% in finger millet straw. Treatment with recombinant laccase was effective in enhancing the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass for ruminant feeding through delignification. To date, a number of hosts have been adventured to produce laccase in large quantities, but, to our knowledge, there are no reports of the expression of laccase protein from Schizophyllum commune in Pichia pastoris, and also on the treatment of crop residues using recombinant laccase for ruminant feeding.</p></details></div>

Fabs are aglycosylated proteins and so many expression platforms have been developed including prokaryotic, yeast and mammalian cells. However, these platforms are not equivalent in terms of cell line development and culture time, product quality and possibly cost of production that greatly influence the success of a drug candidate's pharmaceutical development. This study is an assessment of the humanized Fab fragment ACT017 produced from two microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris) and one mammalian cell host (CHO). Following low scale production and Protein L-affinity purification under generic conditions, physico-chemical and functional quality assessments were carried out prior to economic analysis of industrial scale production using a specialized software (Biosolve, Biopharm Services, UK). Results show higher titer production when using E. coli but associated with high heterogeneity of the protein content recovered in the supernatant. We also observed glycoforms of the Fab produced from P. pastoris, while Fab secreted from CHO was the most homogeneous despite a much longer culture time and slightly higher estimated cost of goods. This study may help inform future pharmaceutical development of this class of therapeutic proteins.</p></details></div>

Identifying the replication origins is crucial for understanding the mechanism of DNA replication. Although several discriminative computational predictors were proposed to identify DNA replication origins of yeast species, they could only be used to identify very tiny parts (250 or 300 bp) of the replication origins. Besides, none of the existing predictors could successfully capture the 'GC asymmetry bias' of yeast species reported by experimental observations. Hence it would not be surprising why their power is so limited. To grasp the CG asymmetry feature and make the prediction able to cover the entire replication regions of yeast species, we develop a new predictor called 'iRO-3wPseKNC'. Results: Rigorous cross validations on the benchmark datasets from four yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis and Pichia pastoris) have indicated that the proposed predictor is really very powerful for predicting the entire DNA duplication origins. Availability and implementation: The web-server for the iRO-3wPseKNC predictor is available at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iRO-3wPseKNC/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

In the present study, the full-length cDNA sequence of a novel sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus invertebrate-type lysozyme (sp-iLys) was synthesized according to the codon usage bias of Pichia pastoris and was cloned into a constitutive expression plasmid pPIC9K. The resulting plasmid, pPIC9K-sp-iLys, was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris strain GS115. The bioactive recombinant sp-iLys was successfully secreted into the culture broth by positive transformants. The highest lytic activity of 960 U/mL of culture supernatant was reached in fed-batch fermentation. Using chitin affinity chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography, recombinant sp-iLys was produced with a yield of 94.5 mg/L and purity of > 99%. Recombinant sp-iLys reached its peak lytic activity of 8560 U/mg at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C and showed antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Aeromonas hydrophila) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis). In addition, recombinant sp-iLys displayed isopeptidase activity which reached the peak at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C with the presence of 0.05 M Na(+). In conclusion, this report describes the heterologous expression of recombinant sp-iLys in P. pastoris on a preparative-scale, which possesses lytic activity and isopeptidase activity. This suggests that sp-iLys might play an important role in the innate immunity of S. purpuratus.</p></details></div>

Multiple plasmids, which contains four copies of EG1, were constructed by isocaudamers, resulted a recombinant strain with EG1 activity up to 39.6 U/mL, 262% higher than that measured in the strain containing only a single copy. A significant increase in activity (151%) was found when eight copies of EG1 was introduced into a different host, compared with a host harboring four copies. Further overexpression of the HAC1 transcription factor in the host harboring eight EG1 copies led to activity of 91.9 U/mL, which is 619% higher than that measured in the original strain. Finally, EG1 activity of 650.1 U/mL was achieved in a 3-L scaled-up fed-batch fermenter and the protein yield was 4.05g/L. The characteristics of recombinant EG1 were also investigated, the optimal values for enzyme activity were 60 degrees C and pH 5.0, which yielded a catalytic efficiency of 312.9mL mg(-1)min(-1) using carboxymethyl cellulose(CMC) as the substrate.</p></details></div>
