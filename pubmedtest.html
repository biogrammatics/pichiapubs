Comparison of amino acid sequences of fucosidases reveals that although the nucleophile is conserved among all alpha-L-fucosidases, the position of the acid/base residue is quite variable. Although several site-directed mutation studies have previously been performed on bacterial fucosidases, the only eukaryotic fucosidase so studied was the human fucosidase. Recent alignments indicate that human and Arthropoda alpha-L-fucosidases share at least 50% identity and the acid/base residue seems to be conserved among them suggesting a common acid/base residue in Metazoa. Here we describe the cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris of a very active alpha-L-fucosidase from the spider Nephilingis cruentata (NcFuc) with a Km value for pNPFuc of 0.4 mM. NcFuc hydrolysed fucoidan, 2 fucosyllactose and also lacto-N-difucohexaose II. Mutants modified at the conserved residues D214N, E209A, E59A were expressed and characterised. The 500-fold lower kcat of D214N than the wild type was consistent with a role in catalysis, as was the 8000-fold lower kcat value of E59A. This was supported by the 57-fold increase in the kcat of E59A upon addition of azide. A complex pH/rate profile was seen for the wild-type and mutant forms of NcFuc, similar to those measured previously for the Sulfolobus fucosidase. The non-conservative catalytic structure and distinct active site organisation reinforce the necessity of structural studies of new fucosidases.</p></details></div>

(+)-Ambrein is a major component of ambergris, an intestinal excretion of sperm whales that is found only serendipitously. Thus, the demand for (-)-ambrox is currently mainly met by chemical synthesis. A recent study described for the first time the applicability of an enzyme cascade consisting of two terpene cyclases, namely squalene-hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AaSHC D377C) and tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene cyclase from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTC) for in vitro (+)-ambrein production starting from squalene. Yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris, are natural producers of squalene and have already been shown in the past to be excellent hosts for the biosynthesis of hydrophobic compounds such as terpenoids. By targeting a central enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, squalene epoxidase Erg1, intracellular squalene levels in P. pastoris could be strongly enhanced. Heterologous expression of AaSHC D377C and BmeTC and, particularly, development of suitable methods to analyze all products of the engineered strain provided conclusive evidence of whole-cell (+)-ambrein production. Engineering of BmeTC led to a remarkable one-enzyme system that was by far superior to the cascade, thereby increasing (+)-ambrein levels approximately 7-fold in shake flask cultivation. Finally, upscaling to 5L bioreactor yielded more than 100mgL(-1) of (+)-ambrein, demonstrating that metabolically engineered yeast P. pastoris represents a valuable, whole-cell system for high-level production of (+)-ambrein.</p></details></div>

Available model analysis applied to this dual-limited condition is scarce and normally does not consider the interaction effects between the substrates. In this work, a dual-limited growth model of P. pastoris considering an interactive kinetic effect was applied to an optimised fed-batch process production of heterologous Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL). In the proposed model, the growth kinetics on glycerol is fully expressed, whereas methanol kinetics is modulated by the co-metabolisation of glycerol, resulting in an enhancing effect of glycerol-specific growth rate. The modelling approach of fed-batch cultures also included the methanol volatilisation caused by the aeration that was found to be a not-negligible phenomenon. The model predicts the ability of P. pastoris to keep control of the methanol concentration in the broth during ROL-optimised production process in fed batch and fits satisfactorily the specific cell growth rate and ROL production. Implications of interaction effect are discussed applying the general procedure of modelling approach.</p></details></div>

Most heterologous P domains expressed in Escherichia coli or Komagataella pastoris (formally known as Pichia pastoris) form P particles consisting of 24 P monomers formed through intermolecular contact in the P regions and an end-linked cysteine tag. The small P particle is only found in P domains with terminal modifications. In this study, the NoV P domain of the most predominant NoV strain GII.4 isolated from Taiwan was expressed in K. pastoris. A high yield of NoV P was obtained using the high-cell density fermentation process in K. pastoris. A large amount of the small P particles and the trimer and dimer complexes formed by 12, 6, and 2 P monomers were observed in both the expression of the NoV P-His and P containing cysteine tag at the N-terminus. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy analysis of the purified NoV P-His and P revealed that most of these small P particles are triangle-, square-, and ring-shaped with a diameter of 14-15 nm. The binding ability of purified NoV P-His and P to human histo-blood group antigen was confirmed by a saliva-binding assay. Without terminal modification, small P particles were formed in our study. The amino acid sequence analysis showed only four different amino acids (residue 84, 119, 136, and 313) between the P domain in this study and other investigated GII.4 strains suggesting that these amino acids might play an important role in the P particle formation. The small P particles formed by the Taiwan-native norovirus P domain overexpressed in K. pastoris may provide further information for morphogenesis studies and vaccine development.</p></details></div>

Both factors heterodimerize to activate the transcription of nuclear genes in response to mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate auxotrophy, but are not well characterized in other yeasts. Here, we demonstrate that the Rtg1p/Rtg3p-mediated retrograde signalling pathway is absent in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris We observed that P. pastoris Rtg1p (PpRtg1p) heterodimerizes with S. cerevisiae Rtg3p and functions as a nuclear, retrograde transcription factor in S. cerevisiae, but not in P. pastoris We noted that P. pastoris Rtg3p lacks a functional leucine zipper and interacts with neither S.cerevisiae Rtg1p (ScRtg1p) nor PpRtg1p. In the absence of an interaction with Rtg3p, PpRtg1p has apparently acquired a novel function as a cytosolic regulator of multiple P. pastoris metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of glutamate dehydrogenase 2 and phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase required for the utilization of glutamate as the sole carbon source. PpRtg1p also had an essential role in methanol metabolism and regulated alcohol oxidase synthesis and was required for the metabolism of ethanol, acetate, and oleic acid, but not of glucose and glycerol. Although PpRtg1p could functionally complement ScRtg1p, ScRtg1p could not complement PpRtg1p, indicating that ScRtg1p is not a functional PpRtg1p homolog. Thus, PpRtg1p functions as a nuclear, retrograde transcription factor in S. cerevisiae and as a cytosolic, post-transcriptional regulator in P. pastoris We conclude that PpRtg1p is a key component of a signalling pathway that regulates multiple metabolic processes in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Classically, monodirectional promoters (MDPs) have been used for such applications, but MDPs are limited in terms of multi-gene co-expression capabilities. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new tools with improved flexibility in terms of genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway assembly, and optimization. Here, motivated by nature's use of bidirectional promoters (BDPs) as a solution for efficient gene co-expression, we generate a library of 168 synthetic BDPs in the yeast Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris), leveraging naturally occurring BDPs as a parts repository. This library of synthetic BDPs allows for rapid screening of diverse expression profiles and ratios to optimize gene co-expression, including for metabolic pathways (taxadiene, beta-carotene). The modular design strategies applied for creating the BDP library could be relevant in other eukaryotic hosts, enabling a myriad of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications.</p></details></div>

However, neither the alpha-galactosidase encoding gene in coconut nor the mutation type has been identified and characterized in normal and curd coconuts. In this study, cDNA and genomic DNA encoding alpha-galactosidase gene alleles from a normal and two curd coconuts were successfully cloned and characterized. The deduced amino acid of wild type alpha-galactosidase contains 398 amino acid residues with a 17N-terminal amino acids signal peptide sequence. Three mutant alleles, the first 19-amino acids from 67 to 85 (ADALVSTGLARLGYQYVNL) deletion with S137R and the second R216T, were identified from curd coconut plant no.1 while the third P250R was identified from curd coconut plant no. 10. All mutations of alpha-galactosidase gene were confirmed by the analysis of parental genomic DNA from normal and curd coconuts. Heterologous expression in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) indicated that recombinant P250R, R216T and 19-amino acids deletion-S137R mutant proteins showed no alpha-galactosidase activity. Only the recombinant wild-type protein was able to detect for alpha-galactosidase activity. These results are in accordance with the no detection of alpha-galactosidase activity in developing curd coconut endosperms by tissue staining. While, the accumulation of enzyme activity was present in the solid endosperm of normal coconut. The full-length cDNA and parental genomic DNA sequences encoding alpha-galactosidase in normal coconut as well as identified curd coconut mutant alleles are reported in Genbank accession no. KJ957156 and KM001681-3. Transcription level of the alpha-galactosidase gene in mature curd coconut endosperm was at least 20 times higher than normal. In conclusion, absence of alpha-galactosidase activity caused by gene mutations associates with an accumulation of oligogalactomannan in endosperms, resulting in curd coconut phenotype.</p></details></div>

Seventy-eight copies of major vault protein (MVP) assemble on polyribosome templates, forming recombinant vault particles, which are of great interest as encapsulation carriers for therapeutics delivery and enzyme stabilization. Baculovirus-insect cell expression is the only system that has been developed for recombinant vault synthesis, but it has low scalability and slow production rate. In this work, we demonstrated the first use of yeast cells for the production of vault particles with full integrity and functionality solely by expressing the cDNA encoding MVP. Vaults synthesized in Pichia pastoris yeast cells are morphologically indistinguishable from recombinant vault particles produced in insect cells, and are able to package and stabilize enzymes resulting in improved longevity and catalytic efficiency. Thus, our results imply that the yeast system is an economical alternative to insect cells for the production of recombinant vaults. The consistency of vault morphology between yeast and insect cell systems also underlines that polyribosome templating may be conserved among eukaryotes, which promises the synthesis and assembly of recombinant human vault particles in other eukaryotic organisms.

The objective of this study was to clone, express, and characterize porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA). The full-length cDNA encoding the PPA was isolated from pig pancreas by RT-PCR and cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector. After the resultant pPICZalphaAlpha-PPA plasmid was transferred into Pichia pastoris, Ni Sepharose affinity column was used to purify the over-expressed extracellular recombinant PPA protein (rePPA) that contains a His-tag to the C terminus and was characterized against the natural enzyme (alpha-amylase from porcine pancreas). The rePPA exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 58 kDa and showed optimal temperature (50 degrees C), optimal pH (7.5), Km (47.8 mg/mL), and Vmax (2,783 U/mg) similar to those of the natural enzyme. The recombinant enzyme was stable at 40 degrees C but lost 60% to 90% (P < 0.05) after exposure to heating at >/=50 degrees C for 30 min. The enzyme activity was little affected by Cu(2+) or Fe(3+), but might be inhibited (40% to 50%) by Zn(2+) at concentrations in pig digesta. However, Ca(2+) exhibited a dose-dependent stimulation of the enzyme activity. In conclusion, the present study successfully cloned the porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase gene and over-expressed the gene in P.pastoris as an extracellular, functional enzyme. The biochemical characterization of the over-produced enzyme depicts its potential and future improvement as an animal feed additive.</p></details></div>

In this work, the gene coding for a novel xylanase (XynC) belonging to family 30 of the glycoside hydrolases (GH), has been identified in the genome of the fungus. The enzyme has been expressed in Pichia pastoris and characterized. The mature XynC has 454 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular weight of 49240. The purified protein shows a molecular weight of 67000, and it is partially deglycosylated using EndoH. Its pH optimum is in the range of 3-5, and the optimal temperature is 45 degrees C. It is active on both arabinoxylan and glucuronoxylan, similarly to other fungal GH 30 xylanases. It liberates a set of oligosaccharides, which have been detected by thin-layer chromatography, thus indicating that it is an endo-acting xylanase. It hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides, releasing mainly xylobiose, in contrast to other fungal GH family 30 enzymes which generate chiefly xylose. Highest sequence identity to a characterized family 30 xylanase is found with the enzyme from the fungus Bispora sp (53%). This is the first GH 30 xylanase described from a Penicillium.</p></details></div>

Recombinant yeast-derived FSH offers a practical alternative; however, the heterologous expression efficiency remains disappointingly low. To improve FSH production in Pichia pastoris, a series of molecular strategies, together with fermentation optimization, were tested in the present study. By comparing clones of the Mut(s) phenotype strain, it was observed that the yield of soluble pFSH increased by approximately 96% in clones of the Mut(+) phenotype strain. The protein levels of soluble pFSHbeta, which confers biological specificity, increased by approximately 143 and 22% after two kinds of codon optimization strategies, respectively. Moreover, compared with the production of soluble pFSHbeta and SUMO-pFSHbeta, the production of soluble protein HSA-pFSHbeta was significantly improved. Furthermore, the optimum pH and methanol concentration for expressing soluble HSA-pFSH in strain H3-3 were determined as 5.0-6.0 and 1.5-2% in shake-flask, and the yield of soluble HSA-pFSH could reach 40.8 mg/l after purification. In vitro bioactivity assays showed that recombinant HSA-pFSH could efficiently stimulate cAMP synthesis in HEK293 cells expressing porcine FSHR. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the application of phenotypic selection of aox1 mutants, combined with codon optimization, the choice of fusion partners, and fermentation optimization, considerably increased the yield of pFSH in supernatant of P. pastoris and thus provided a valuable reference for the large-scale recombinant expression of pFSH.</p></details></div>

The mutant and native VEGF165b proteins without purification tags were expressed via the Pichia pastoris expression system followed by purification with a HiTrap heparin affinity chromatography column through optimization of the purification conditions. Furthermore, its binding affinity with VEGF Receptors and its functions in vitro and in vivo were examined. Results showed that the half-life of mutant VEGF165b increased to approximately 10 times (Intravenous), 9.1 times (Intraperitoneal) and 5.4 times (Subcutaneous) greater than that of VEGF165b, and the mutation did not cause significant alteration of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 binding affinity. Mutant VEGF165b inhibited the proliferation and migration of HUVECs in vitro, similar to the native VEGF165b. In a mouse melanoma model, mutant VEGF165b exhibited stronger anti-tumor activity in comparison with its native counterpart. These results indicate that the mutant VEGF165b had a prolonged half-life and retained the anti-angiogenic activity of the native VEGF165b, suggesting that this novel mutant VEGF165b may be a stronger anti-cancer agent.</p></details></div>

Since membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are highly dynamic and regulated by ligands or other perturbations, NMR methods are potentially well suited to answer basic functional questions (such as addressing the biophysical basis of ligand efficacy) as well as guiding applications (such as novel ligand design). However, such studies on eukaryotic membrane proteins have often been limited by the inability to incorporate optimal isotopic labels for NMR methods developed for large protein/lipid complexes, including methyl TROSY. We review the different expression systems for production of isotopically labeled membrane proteins and highlight the use of the yeast Pichia pastoris to achieve perdeuteration and (13)C methyl probe incorporation within isoleucine sidechains.

This relatively new class of binding scaffold has various advantages: i) it has a single peptide composition, amenable to molecular engineering for enhancing its stability and affinity; ii) it has a small size, contributing better tissue penetration and easier production using microorganism expression system. Monomeric arVLRB142, which can specifically bind to the glycoprotein of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), was expressed in Pichia pastoris. High quantity recombinant monomeric arVLRB142 (rVLR142(mono)) was purified from 100ml of culture with a resulting yield of 2.6+/-1.3mg of target protein. Functional studies revealed that the purified rVLR142(mono) can specifically recognize low levels of the target antigen (recombinant glycoprotein) (i.e. as low as 0.1nM), but also the native glycoprotein of VHSV. The expressed rVLR142(mono) exhibited high levels of stability and it retained it binding capacity over broad temperature (4 degrees C~60 degrees C) and pH ranges (pH1.5-12.5). We developed an effective expression system for mass production of monomeric VLRB based on P. pastoris. The recombinant protein that was obtained offers promising binding avidity and biophysical stability and its potential use in various biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

A P. pastoris expression platform based on the strong rhamnose-inducible promoter P LRA3 did not meet the demands of industrial application due to poor production of recombinant proteins. To enhance recombinant protein production of this expression platform, a genetically engineered strain, P. pastoris GS115m, with decreased rhamnose metabolic flux was developed from P. pastoris GS115 by replacement of the rhamnose-inducible promoter P LRA4 with another much weaker rhamnose-inducible promoter, P LRA2 . Grown in MRH and YPR media using rhamnose as the main carbon source, the engineered strain showed decreased growth rate and maximal biomass compared with the parental strain. More importantly, grown in rhamnose-containing MRH and YPR media, the recombinant engineered strain harboring a beta-galactosidase gene lacB, whose expression was regulated by rhamnose-inducible P LRA3 , yielded substantial increases, of 2.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively, in target protein production over the parental strain. Additionally, grown in MRH and YPR media, the engineered strain had remarkable cell flocculation and rapid sedimentation with the increasing of cell density, providing an effective and convenient separation of the fermentation supernatant from strain cells. The engineered strain is a promising expression host for industrial production of target proteins due to its advantages over the parental strain as follows: (i) improved production of recombinant proteins, and (ii) remarkable cell flocculation and rapid sedimentation.</p></details></div>

However, endoxylanases from cold-adapted fungi, especially those from Antarctica, have been less studied. In this work, a cDNA from the Antarctic fungus Cladosporium sp. with similarity to endoxylanases from glycosyl hydrolase family 10, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The pure recombinant enzyme (named XynA) showed optimal activity on xylan at 50 degrees C and pH 6-7. The enzyme releases xylooligosaccharides but not xylose, indicating that XynA is a classical endoxylanase. The enzyme was most active on xylans with high content of arabinose (rye arabinoylan and wheat arabinoxylan) than on xylans with low content of arabinose (oat spelts xylan, birchwood xylan and beechwood xylan). Finally, XynA showed a very low thermostability. After 20-30 min of incubation at 40 degrees C, the enzyme was completely inactivated, suggesting that XynA would be the most thermolabile endoxylanase described so far in filamentous fungi. This is one of the few reports describing the heterologous expression and characterization of a xylanase from a fungus isolated from Antarctica.</p></details></div>

Cell wall invertase (CWI) and vacuolar invertase (VI) are glycosylated proteins and exert fundamental roles in plant growth as well as in response to environmental cues. As yet, comprehensive insight into invertase encoding genes are lacking in Glycine max. In the present study, the systematic survey of gene structures, coding regions, regulatory elements, conserved motifs, and phylogenies resulted in the identification of thirty(-)two putative invertase genes in soybean genome. Concomitantly, impacts on gene expression, enzyme activities, proteins, and soluble sugar accumulation were explored in specific tissues upon stress perturbation. In combination with the observation of subcellular compartmentation of the fluorescent fusion protein that indeed exported to apoplast, heterologous expression, and purification in using Pichia pastoris system revealed that GmCWI4 was a typical extracellular invertase. We postulated that GmCWI4 may play regulatory roles and be involved in pathogenic fungi defense. The experimental evaluation of physiological significance via phenotypic analysis of mutants under stress exposure has been initiated. Moreover, our paper provides theoretical basis for elucidating molecular mechanisms of invertase in association with inhibitors underlying the stress regime, and will contribute to the improvement of plant performance to a diverse range of stressors.</p></details></div>

The specific activities of TaCel45 towards lichenin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na), and barley beta-glucan were 769, 498, and 486 U/mg protein, respectively, which are higher than the values for all other reported GH45 cellulases. TaCel45 had maximum activity at pH 5.0-6.0 and 60-65 degrees C with barley beta-glucan and CMC-Na as substrates and had a melting temperature (Tm) of 68.4 degrees C. However, TaCel45 exhibited extraordinary thermostability at 90 and 100 degrees C, retaining more than 70 and 45% of its activity after a 1-h incubation, respectively. Seven mutants (C11S, C12S, C16S, C31S, C171S, C193S, and C203S) were then constructed to investigate the effects of each disulfide bond on the structure, activity, and stability of TaCel45. As a result, six disulfide bonds (C11-C136, C16-C87, C31-C57, C88-C203, C90-C193, and C160-Cy171) were found to be indispensable for the folding, secretion, and activity of TaCel45, while C12-C48 was critical for thermal adaptation and refolding. The mutant C12S showed decreased optimal temperature and Tm values of 50 and 60.2 degrees C, respectively, and retained less than 50% of the thermal refolding ability of the wild type. Overall, this study demonstrated that disulfide bonds play a vital role in the folding and refolding capability and thermostability of this GH45 cellulase.</p></details></div>

Within this context, cysteine-rich antifungal AFP-like peptides stand out among many different antimicrobial compounds given their production easiness, stability, versatility, and efficacy. AFP from Aspergillus giganteus represents the hallmark of this still increasing family of antifungal polypeptides. Close in silico analyses of the Fusarium graminearum genome revealed the presence of an AFP-like peptide, here designated as FgAFP. This new peptide was cloned, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and characterized. The results obtained showed its strong and specific antifungal activity against several well-recognized maize pathogens, but inefficacy against F. oxysporum, which has not been described as a natural biological competitor of other fungal pathogens assayed. All results together suggest that this small peptide is an important factor for the fungal interplays involved in maize infection and reveals unforeseen potential biotechnological applications for FgAFP in maize production and storage.</p></details></div>

Recombinant plasmids with one, two and four cassettes of the MIP gene have been successfully constructed in the pPICZalphaA expression vector to study the effects of gene copy number on MIP production. The MIP protein can be detected by dot-blot analysis from the culture broth of P. pastoris KM71H 24h after placement in MMH induction medium. The secretion levels of MIP protein in culture broth at 72h after induction indicated that P. pastoris KM71H with one cassette of the MIP gene had highest MIP protein levels (4.19+/-0.96mgL(-1)). The transcription levels of the MIP gene increased proportionately with copy number. However, the amount of secreted MIP protein showed no correlation. The MIP molecular mass was 5756.951Da, as confirmed by typical MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MIP protein in culture broth was purified by two steps purification including SP Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography followed by ultrafiltration (10kDaMW cutoff). The percentage of MIP recovery after the two-step purification was 70%, with a single band in a native-PAGE. The biological activity of tryptic hydrolyzed MIP was determined via the expression of the glucose transporter 4 gene (GLUT4) in H9c2 (2-1) cell line by RT-qPCR, and the results demonstrated that the MIP protein can induce glucose uptake and upregulation of GLUT4 mRNA transcription at 3h and that this activity was related to Humalog((R)) insulin.</p></details></div>

Insertion of multiple 2As within a single open reading frame (ORF) produces multiple proteins; hence, 2As have been used in a very wide range of biotechnological and biomedical applications. During translation, these 2A peptide sequences mediate a eukaryote-specific, self-"cleaving" event, termed "ribosome skipping" with very high efficiency. A particular advantage of using 2As is the ability to simultaneously translate a number of proteins at an equal level in all eukaryotic systems although, naturally, final steady-state levels depend upon other factors-notably protein stability. By contrast, the use of internal ribosome entry site elements for co-expression results in an unbalanced expression due to the relative inefficiency of internal initiation. For example, a 1:1 ratio is of particular importance for the biosynthesis of the heavy-chain and light-chain components of antibodies: highly valuable as therapeutic proteins. Furthermore, each component of these "artificial polyprotein" systems can be independently targeted to different sub-cellular sites. The potential of this system was vividly demonstrated by concatenating multiple gene sequences, linked via 2A sequences, into a single, long, ORF-a polycistronic construct. Here, ORFs comprising the biosynthetic pathways for violacein (five gene sequences) and beta-carotene (four gene sequences) were concatenated into a single cistron such that all components were co-expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. In this review, we provide useful information on 2As to serve as a guide for future utilities of this co-expression technology in basic research, biotechnology, and clinical applications.</p></details></div>

Komagataella) pastoris is commonly associated with the induction of an unfolded protein response (UPR) usually apparent through increased intracellular levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperones such as Kar2/Bip. During methanol-induced secretory production of an insulin precursor (IP) under industrially relevant fed-batch conditions the initially high level of intracellular Kar2/Bip after batch growth on glycerol unexpectedly declined in the following methanol fed-batch phase misleadingly suggesting that IP production had a low impact on UPR activation.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Analysis of the protein production independent level of Kar2/Bip revealed that high Kar2/Bip levels were reached in the exponential growth phase of glycerol batch cultures followed by a strong decline of Kar2/Bip during entry into stationary phase. Ultra-structural cell morphology studies revealed autophagic processes (e.g. ER phagy) at the end of the glycerol batch phase most likely responsible for the degradation of ER resident chaperones such as Kar2/Bip. The pre-induction level of Kar2/Bip did not affect the IP secretion efficiency in the subsequent methanol-induced IP production phase. During growth on methanol intracellular Kar2/Bip levels declined in IP producing and non-producing host cells. However, extracellular accumulation of Kar2/Bip was observed in IP-producing cultures but not in non-producing controls. Most importantly, the majority of the extracellular Kar2/Bip accumulated in the culture supernatant of IP producing cells as truncated protein (approx. 35 kDa).</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Rapid growth leads to higher basal levels of the major UPR marker protein Kar2/Bip independent of recombinant protein production. Entry into stationary phase or slower growth on poorer substrate, e.g. methanol, leads to a lower basal Kar2/Bip level. Methanol-induced secretory IP production elicits a strong UPR activation which counteracts the reduced UPR during slow growth on methanol. The major ER chaperone Kar2/Bip is found together with recombinant IP in the culture medium where full-length Kar2/Bip accumulates in addition to large amounts of truncated Kar2/Bip. Thus, for judging UPR activating properties of the produced protein it is important to additionally analyze the medium not only for intact Kar2/Bip but also for truncated versions of this UPR reporter protein.</p></details></div>

Since there is no decisive treatment, the only approach is vaccination of high-risk group. Due to the high cost, the current HPV vaccines are not affordable in developing countries. This study aimed to produce a chimeric L1/L2 protein in Pichia Pastoris system. To develop the VLPs retrieved from chimeric L1/L2 protein HPV-16, first, a cross-neutralizing epitope of HPV-16 L2 gene was inserted into L1 HPV-16 gene. The chimeric L1/L2 HPV-16 was inserted in pPICZA plasmid and expressed in Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Then, the expression of recombinant protein was tested by SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses. The final purification of VLPs was carried out by ultra-centrifugation (130000 g) using a 10-40% sucrose density gradient for 4 h at 4 degrees C. The purified VLPs were visualized using atomic-force and electron microscopies. The western blot assay was carried out for L1-HPV-16 and L2-HPV-16 antibodies separately. Amount of 55ng of the purified VLPs were coated to the wells of ELISA for detection of L1 HPV-16 antibody and L2-HPV-16 antibody by ELISA test separately using commercial L1 HPV-16 and L2-HPV-16 antibodies. In addition to the sera of 16 patients positive for HPV-16 and 85 sera negative for HPV infections were tested for detection of HPV-16 antibody by ELISA test and the results were compared with commercial test kit. The purified VLPs was observed by TEM and AFM. Further, the visualizing of formation of VLPs by TEM and AFM had distinctive advantages, which complement each other. The result of purified VLPs by SDS-PAGE showed a band of 60 KD which was also confirmed by western blot assay. The results proved the expression of chimeric L1/L2 HPV-16 protein in P. pastoris. The results of ELISA for both L1-HPV-16 and L2 -HPV-16 showed positive reaction.

Although thermostability of these mutants decreased slightly, ATLLid and ATLV218W still exhibited the maximum activity at pH 5.0 and high stability in a broad range of pH (4.0-8.0), which were similar to the wild type. Using homologous modeling and molecular docking technology the mechanism for the improvement of catalytic activity was analyzed. These findings not only shed light on the relationship between the lid domain/substrate binding pocket domain and catalytic activity but also provided comprehensive scheme for further engineering to gain more efficient lipases.</p></details></div>

In this study, we isolated a beta-glucuronidase (TpGUS79A) from filamentous fungus Talaromyces pinophilus Li-93, which can specifically and precisely convert GL to GAMG without the formation of byproduct glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) from the further hydrolysis of GAMG. Firstly, TpGUS79A was purified and identified through MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS and deglycosylation, indicating that TpGUS79A was a highly N-glycosylated monomeric protein with molecular mass of around 85 kDa, including around 25 kDa of glycan moiety. Then, the gene of TpGUS79A was cloned and verified by the heterologous expression in P. pichia TpGUS79A belonged to glycoside hydrolase (GH) 79, but shared low amino acid sequence identity (<35%) with the available GH79 GUS enzymes. TpGUS79A had strict specificity toward the glycan but poor specificity toward the aglycone. Interestingly, TpGUS79A recognizes and hydrolyzes the distal glucuronic bond of GL, but cannot cleave the glucuronic bond in GAMG. TpGUS79A showed much higher catalytic efficiency on GL (kcat/Km of 11.14 mM(-1) s(-1)) than the artificial substrate pNP beta-glucopyranosiduronic acid (kcat/Km of 0.01 mM(-1) s(-1)), which was different from most GUSs. Homology modeling, substrate docking and sequence alignment were employed to identify the key residues for substrate recognition. Finally, a fed-batch fermentation in 150-L fermentor was established to prepare GAMG through GL hydrolysis by T. pinophilus Li-93. Therefore, TpGUS79A is potentially a powerful biocatalyst for environment-friendly and cost-effective production of GAMG.IMPORTANCE Compared to chemical methods, the biotransformation of glycyrrhizin (GL) into glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-beta-d-glucuronide (GAMG) with higher sweetness and stronger pharmacological activity than GL catalyzed by beta-glucuronidase is environmentally friendly approach due to the mild reaction conditions and the high yield of GAMG. However, current available GUSs show low substrate specificity toward GL to further hydrolyze GAMG to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) as byproduct, increasing the difficulty of subsequent separation and purification. In the present study, we succeeded in isolating a novel beta-glucuronidase (named TpGUS79A) from Talaromyces pinophilus Li-93, which specifically hydrolyzes GL to GAMG without the formation of GA. TpGUS79A also shows higher activity on GL than the previously characterized GUSs. Moreover, the gene of TpGUS79A was cloned and the function was verified by heterologous expression in P. pastoris. Therefore, TpGUS79A can serve as powerful biocatalyst for the cost-effective production of GAMG through GL transformation.</p></details></div>

After expression in Pichia pastoris GS115, the purified recombinant BisGlu16B showed maximal activity at pH 4.0 and 55 degrees C and had broad substrate specificity (beta-1,3-/beta-1,4-mixed, beta-1,3-, beta-1,4-, and beta-1,6-linked glucan, and beta-1,4-mannan). The enzyme possessed high specific activities toward barley beta-glucan (34700 U.mg(-1)), lichenan (23900 U.mg(-1)), and laminarin (9000 U.mg(-1)). After removing the C-terminal module, the truncated mutant, BisGlu16B-DeltaC, retained similar enzymatic properties to the wild type but displayed significantly enhanced activities (up to 2.5-fold). Functional and structural analyses indicated that the C-terminal module plays a key role in the substrate binding of BisGlu16B.

One of the characteristics distinguishing them from flowering plants is its triterpene metabolism. Most cyclic triterpenes in ferns are hydrocarbons derived from the direct cyclization of squalene by squalene cyclases (SCs). Both ferns and more complex plants share sterols and biosynthetic enzymes, such as cycloartenol synthases (CASs). Polystichum belongs to Dryopteridaceae, and is one of the most species-rich of all fern genera. Several Polystichum ferns in Japan are classified as one of three possible chemotypes, based on their triterpene profiles. In this study, we describe the molecular cloning and functional characterization of cDNAs encoding a SC (PPH) and a CAS (PPX) from the type species Polystichum polyblepharum. Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris revealed that PPH and PPX are hydroxyhopane synthase and CAS, respectively. By using the PPH and PPX sequences, we successfully isolated SC- and CAS-encoding cDNAs from six Polystichum ferns. Phylogenetic analysis, based on SCs and oxidosqualene cyclase sequences, suggested that the Polystichum subclade in the fern SC and CAS clades reflects the chemotype-but not the molecular phylogeny constructed using plastid molecular markers. These results show a possible relation between triterpenes and their biosynthetic enzymes in Polystichum.</p></details></div>

The gene encoding mature Ef-Man was expressed in Pichia pastoris (GS115 strain). Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, the molecular mass of the purified recombinant Ef-Man (rEf-Man) was estimated to be 39kDa. All catalytically important residues of endo-1,4-beta-mannanases in the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5 were conserved in Ef-Man. The optimal temperature for rEf-Man was identified as 60 degrees C.

SUPER-H168 and was targeted by a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. The DeltaMono mutant abolished hypocrellin production, whereas the DeltaMono complement mutant restored hypocrellin production. Relative expression levels of the Mono and its adjacent genes were abolished in the DeltaMono mutant compared with the wild-type strain. These results indicate the essential role of Mono in hypocrellin biosynthesis. The Mono gene of Shiraia bambusicola was further expressed in Pichia pastoris and salicylate monooxygenase activity was detected, which suggested that this monooxygenase has the ability to catalyse decarboxylative hydroxylation. The relative growth ratio of the DeltaMono mutant was significantly improved compared with the wild-type strain. In contrast to the wild-type strain, the DeltaMono mutant also represented excellent oxidative stress tolerance after exposure to high concentrations of H2O2 (16 mM) based on the increasing activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These results suggest that DeltaMono mutants could be used as microbial cell factories to produce metabolites that will cause oxidative stress. This study also enhances our understanding of hypocrellin biosynthesis and opens an avenue for decoding the hypocrellin pathway.</p></details></div>

Expression of recombinant CRM197 in E. coli is limited due to formation of inclusion bodies. Soluble expression attempts in Bacillus subtilis, P. fluorescens, Pichia pastoris, and E. coli were partially unsuccessful or did not generate yields sufficient for industrial scale production. Multiple approaches have been attempted to produce CRM197 in E. coli, which has attractive features such as high yield, simplicity, fast growth, etc., including expression of oxidative host, concurrent expression of chaperones, or periplasmic export. Recently, alternative methods for recovery of insoluble proteins expressed in E. coli were reported. Compared to traditional denaturation/refolding, these methods used the non-denaturing solubilization agent, N-lauroylsarkosine to obtain higher recovery yields of native proteins. Based on this work, here, we focused on solubilization of CRM197 from E. coli inclusion bodies. First, CRM197 was expressed as inclusion bodies by high-level expression of recombinant CRM197 in E. coli (126.8 mg/g dcw). Then bioactive CRM197 was isolated from these inclusion bodies with high yield (108.1 mg/g dcw) through solubilization with N-lauroylsarkosine including Triton X-100 and CHAPS, and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. In this study, we present a cost-effective alternative for the production of bioactive CRM197 and compare our recovery yield with yields in other production processes.</p></details></div>

Given that their administration is relatively easy and stress-free, oral vaccines have both economic and animal welfare benefits. Yet, mostly due to their limited efficacy, only very few oral vaccines are available to aquaculture industry. Here we present a method for oral vaccine delivery based on the yeast Pichia pastoris. We could express a model antigen, green fluorescent protein (GFP), in this yeast and subsequently show delivery of the GFP protein to the intestine of juvenile flounder or adult carp and trout. We tested this approach in several commercially-relevant fish species, from juvenile to adult stage. To test the oral delivery of antigen to larval fish, the GFP-expressing Pichia pastoris was first fed to planktonic crustacean Daphnia or rotifers that served as 'bioencapsulation vehicles' and afterwards, fed to flounder larvae. Again, we could show delivery of intact GFP protein to the intestine. In rainbow trout, the orally-administered GFP-expressing yeast elicited a rapid local innate immune response in the intestine and a subsequent systemic response in the spleen. Our results show that Pichia pastoris is a good vehicle for oral antigen delivery and that it can be used in non-encapsulated form for older fish or in bioencapsulated form for larval fish.

The use of methanol has major drawbacks, so there is a demand for alternative promoters with good induction properties such as the glucose-regulated P GTH1 promoter which we reported recently. To further increase its potential, we investigated its regulation in more details by the screening of promoter variants harboring deletions and mutations. Thereby we could identify the main regulatory region and important putative transcription factor binding sites of P GTH1 . Concluding from that, yeast metabolic regulators, monomeric Gal4-class motifs, carbon source-responsive elements, and yeast GC-box proteins likely contribute to the regulation of the promoter. We engineered a P GTH1 variant with greatly enhanced induction properties compared with that of the wild-type promoter. Based on that, a model-based bioprocess design for high volumetric productivity in a limited time was developed for the P GTH1 variant, to employ a glucose fed-batch strategy that clearly outperformed a classical methanol fed-batch of a P AOX1 strain in terms of titer and process performance.</p></details></div>

BAF180 is the chromatin-targeting subunit of the PBAF complex. BAF180 has six bromodomains, two BAH domains, and one HMG box. Bromodomains are known to recognize acetylated-lysines on histones and play a role in nucleosome recognition. BAH domains are required for ubiquitination of PCNA, a key regulator of DNA damage. The putative HMG box, if functional, may be involved in DNA-binding. While the binding specificities of individual bromodomains have been studied by our lab and others, the results have failed to reach a consensus. The acetyl-histone binding features of the full-length protein is unknown and is the motivation for this work. The hypothetical HMG and BAH domains have not been studied and the actual function of these regions is currently unknown. Thus, the precise interactions of this large and complex protein are not well-studied. Advances in understanding this large protein have been hindered by the inability to express and purify recombinant full-length BAF180 protein. Currently, only phenomenological studies using BAF180 expressed in mammalian cells have been conducted. Here, we report the successful expression, purification of full-length biologically active BAF180 protein using the GAP promoter in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris. The ability to express full-length and mutated BAF180 will allow for biophysical binding studies. Knowledge of the binding interactions is critical for us to understand the role of BAF180 in cancer development and its progression.</p></details></div>

However, currently no direct evidence exists that PMOs oxidize C6 positions in cellulose, and molecular mechanism of C1, C4 and C6 oxidation is unclear. Results: In this study, a PMO gene (Ctpmo1) belonging to AA9 was isolated from Chaetomium thermophilum and successfully expressed and correctly processed in Pichia pastoris. A simple and effective chemical method of using Br2 to oxidize CtPMO1 reaction products was developed to directly identify C4- and C6-oxidized products by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The PMO (CtPMO1) cleaves phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (PASC) and celloheptaose, resulting in the formation of oxidized and nonoxidized oligosaccharides. Product identification shows that the enzyme can oxidize C1, C4, and C6 in PASC and cello-oligosaccharides. Mutagenesis of the aromatic residues Tyr27, His64, His157 and residue Tyr206 on the flat surface of CtPMO1 was carried out using site-directed mutagenesis to form the mutated enzymes Y27A, H64A, H157A, and Y206A. It was demonstrated that Y27A retained complete activity of C1, C4, and C6 oxidation on cellulose; Y206A retained partial activity of C1 and C4 oxidation but completely lost activity of C6 oxidation on cellulose; H64A almost completely lost activity of C1, C4, and C6 oxidation on cellulose; and H157A completely lost activity of C1, C4, and C6 oxidation on cellulose. Conclusions: This finding provides direct and molecular evidence for C1, C4, especially C6 oxidation by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase. CtPMO1 oxidizes not only C1 and C4 but also C6 positions in cellulose. The aromatic acid residues His64, His157 and residue Tyr206 on CtPMO1 flat surface are involved in activity of C1, C4, C6 oxidation.</p></details></div>

However, there have been no comprehensive reports on domain rearrangements of bispecific single-chain Db (scDb) and tandem single-chain Fv (taFv), which are widely used bsAb formats. In this study, we designed all possible domain orders for scDb and taFv (each with eight variants) with identical Fv pairs and individually expressed all 16 variants using Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, and Brevibacillus choshinensis. Comprehensive investigations showed that the intrinsic functions of the variants were similar to each other, regardless of the expression host system, but expression levels varied depending on the format as well as on the host cell. Among the 16 variants, we found a promising candidate that exhibited high activity and productivity.

Free astaxanthin has better solubility than astaxanthin esters (Ast-E), and is a useful auxiliary ingredient in health foods and medicines. Our goal was to establish an improved enzymatic method for preparation of free astaxanthin from natural sources (e.g., the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis), to expand the potential applications of free astaxanthin. Results: The alkaline lipase gene proalip and its propeptide were cloned and successfully fusion-expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. The recombinant lipase was termed Lipase-YH. Through optimization of culture conditions (medium formulation, pH, added methanol concentration), cell growth (OD600) and secreted enzyme activity respectively reached to 280 and 2050 U/mL in a 50-L autofermentor. Activity of Lipase-YH enzyme powder was about 40,000 U/g. Hydrolysis of Ast-E (extracted from H. pluvialis) by Lipase-YH occurred in aqueous phase, and reaction conditions were optimized based on emulsification method and enzyme/substrate ratio. The highest enzymatic reaction rate was observed for substrate concentration 200 mug/mL, with maximal free astaxanthin yield (80%) at 1 h, and maximal Ast-E hydrolysis rate 96%, as confirmed by TLC, HPLC, and mass spectroscopy. Conclusion: A novel, efficient enzymatic process was developed for production of free astaxanthin through hydrolysis of Ast-E. Lipase activity was enhanced, and production cost was greatly reduced. The unique structure of free astaxanthin allows linkage to various functional compounds, which will facilitate development of novel pharmaceutical and food products in future studies.</p></details></div>

They have been emerged as important tools in optogenetics where light is used to trigger a change in the membrane potential of live cells which induces downstream physiological cascades. There is also increased interest in their applications for generating light-responsive biomaterials. Here we have used a two-step screening protocol to develop a Pichia pastoris strain that produces superior yields of an enhance variant of CaChR2 (from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), called ChIEF. We have also studied the effect of the co-factor, namely all-trans retinal (ATR), on the recombinant overexpression, folding, and function of the protein. We found that both ChIEF-mCitrine and CaChR2 can be overexpressed and properly trafficked to the plasma membrane in yeast regardless of the presence of the ATR. The purified protein was reconstituted into large unilamellar lipid vesicle using the detergent-assisted method. Using 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) as the fluorescent proton indicator, we have developed a flux assay to verify the light-activated proton flux in the ChIEF-mCitrine vesicles. Hence such vesicles are effectively light-responsive nano-compartments. The results presented in this work lays foundations for creating bio-mimetic materials with a light-responsive function using channelrhodopsins.</p></details></div>

Here we successfully applied this technique to the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and classified its conditionally essential/non-essential gene sets. Firstly, we showed that two DNA transposons, TcBuster and Sleeping beauty, had high transposition activities in P. pastoris. By merging their insertion libraries and performing Tn-seq, we identified a total of 202,858 unique insertions under glucose supported growth condition. We then developed a machine learning method to classify the 5,040 annotated genes into putatively essential, putatively non-essential, ambig1 and ambig2 groups, and validated the accuracy of this classification model. Besides, Tn-seq was also performed under methanol supported growth condition and methanol specific essential genes were identified. The comparison of conditionally essential genes between glucose and methanol supported growth conditions helped to reveal potential novel targets involved in methanol metabolism and signaling. Our findings suggest that transposon mutagenesis and Tn-seq could be applied in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to classify conditionally essential/non-essential gene sets.

The Xop411 gp21 protein was identified here as a peptidoglycan glycohydrolase by Western blotting and zymogram assay, and localized to the phage tail by immunogold-labelling electron microscopy. This protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, larger than that calculated from the amino acid sequence, 15 kDa with 130 residues. The recombinant gp21 expressed in Escherichia coli formed inclusion bodies, which gained enzyme activity after in-gel renaturation. In contrast, the secreted recombinant protein (s-gp21His) expressed in Pichia pastoris was soluble and enzymatically active. Plate assays showed that s-gp21His was capable of killing 3 species of Xanthomonas, a genus containing 27 closely related plant pathogenic species, as well as the opportunistic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia causing nosocomial infections.

The asymmetric reduction of 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid (OPBA) by oxidoreductases is an efficient approach for its synthesis. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for asymmetric synthesis of R-HPBA using recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing the Tyr52Leu variant of D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) from Lactobacillus plantarum. The recombinant yeast cells showed impressive catalytic activity at a high concentration of NaOPBA (380 mM, 76 g/L) and achieved full conversion starting with 40 g/L NaOPBA or even at higher concentration. Under optimized reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 37 degrees C, and 2% glucose), a full conversion with > 95% reaction yield and ~ 100% product enantiomeric excess (ee) was achieved for the preparation of R-HPBA on a 2-g scale. The findings of this study promote both the biotransformation of R-HPBA and an extension of the application of recombinant yeast as biocatalysts.</p></details></div>

Using quantitative analyses of fluorescence microscopy images, a methanol-inducible promoter and a host strain were selected, and preculture and assay conditions were optimized to improve the methanol detection limit. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the distribution and geometric mean of cellular fluorescence intensity against various concentrations of methanol revealed a detection limit of 2.5 muM. Finally, this biosensor was applied to evaluate the activity of a heterologously expressed pectin methylesterase (PME). The cellular fluorescence intensity was proportional to the copy number of the PME expression cassette, the protein level, and the enzyme activity. This biosensor can be used for high-throughput screening of single cells harboring high methanol-producing activity, and thereby, the development of a bioconversion process using methanol-producing enzymes.</p></details></div>

The recombinant strain was induced by methanol for 96 hours, and we collected the supernatant and identified the VIP by mass spectrometry. The molecular weight of VIP was consistent with theoretical molecular weight. The final result showed that the target peptide VIP was successfully expressed. The experimental investigations of agarose gel diffusion revealed that the recombinant expression modified VIP had relatively strong antibacterial activity to E. coli ATCC25922 and S. aureus ATCC25923. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of VIP to E. coli ATCC25922 and S. aureus ATCC25923 was 8 mmol/L and 16 mmol/L. Further cytotoxicity and hemolytic experiments indicated that recombinant VIP was non-toxic to normal cells NCM460 and IPEC-J2, had little hemolysis activity to SD rat erythrocytes. Meanwhile, by transmission electron microscopy, we found that VIP mainly inhibited bacteria by disrupting the cell membrane.

Fructose released by the hydrolysis of fructans is an energy source for emerging asparagus spears. Plant fructans are hydrolyzed by fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), whose presence in asparagus has not yet been fully characterized. Here, we describe for the first time the purification and characterization of an FEH from asparagus, and the functional analysis of its gene. The purified enzyme was predicted to exist as a dimer (approximately 130 kDa) consisting of two polypeptides with a molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa. N-terminal sequences of the purified enzyme were matched with the amino acid sequences of aoeh4a and aoeh4b cDNAs isolated from asparagus (cv. Gijnlim and Taihouwase). Native enzymes obtained from asparagus roots and recombinant enzymes produced by Pichia pastoris showed fructan 1-exohydrolase (1-FEH) activity via the hydrolysis of inulin-type fructan. Unlike other 1-FEHs, these enzymes showed minimal hydrolysis of 1-kestose but efficiently hydrolyzed neokestose. Therefore, the enzyme was termed 6G&1-FEH. Gene expression studies in asparagus roots showed that aoeh4 increased during root storage at 2 degrees C and spear harvesting. These findings suggest that 6G&1-FEH may be involved in fructan hydrolysis in asparagus roots to provide an energy source for emerging asparagus spears.</p></details></div>

When the vector was used to express the xylanase (XynA) gene in P. pastoris, the highest enzyme activity reached 343 U/mL with glycerol as the carbon source, which was 45.9% higher than that of the integrative expression. At the same time, the specific enzyme activity of XynA was increased by 81.2%. We further studied the expression level of recombinant strains with different carbon sources such as glycerol, glucose, sucrose and mixed carbon source (sucroseglycerol=12). The highest expression level was achieved with glycerol and the lowest with sucrose. The episomal expression vector pGAPZalphaA-PARS greatly promotes the application of P. pastoris in the food industry because GAP promoter does not require methanol as induction material. Meanwhile, the episomal vector can greatly improve the expression level, which lays the foundation for further research to improve the high expression of GAP promoter.</p></details></div>

So far, cytotoxicity studies of CDs have focused on human cells and are mainly conducted on limited cell lines. In the present study, toxicity assessment of CDs was evaluated on yeast cells Pichia pastoris as a unicellular eukaryotic model. Results revealed dose-dependent toxicity of CDs on yeast cells and less relative cell growth in 25mg/ml of CDs as compared to the control group. CDs binding curve confirmed the interaction between CDs and surface of yeast cells. SEM images showed that the CDs caused cell shrinkage and hole formation on the surface of yeast cells and also induced slightly cell deformation. It was demonstrated that CDs could generate the ROS dose-dependently. Finally, results showed the growth inhibition and ROS generation effects of CDs were enhanced at light exposure, as an important environmental factor. These findings could have important implications for applications of CDs.</p></details></div>

Improving the efficiency of existing biotechnological manufacturing processes is therefore paramount. When produced biotechnologically, trypsinogen-the inactive precursor of trypsin-is advantageous, since active trypsin would impair cell viability. To study factors affecting cell physiology and the production of trypsinogen in fed-batch cultures, we built a fusion protein of porcine trypsinogen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in Pichia pastoris. The experiments were performed with two different pH values (5.0 and 5.9) and two constant specific growth rates (0.02 and 0.04 1/h), maintained using exponential addition of methanol. All the productivity data presented rely on an active determination of trypsin obtained by proteolysis of the trypsinogen produced. The pH of the medium did not affect cell growth, but significantly influenced specific production of trypsinogen: A 1.7-fold higher concentration of trypsinogen was achieved at pH 5.9 (64 mg/L at 0.02 1/h) compared to pH 5.0. EGFP was primarily used to facilitate detection of intracellular protein over the biosynthetic time course. Using flow cytometry with fluorescence detection, cell disruption was avoided, and protein extraction and purification prior to analysis were unnecessary. However, Western blot and SDS-PAGE showed that cleavage of EGFP-trypsinogen fusion protein occurred, probably caused by Pichia-endogenous proteases. The fluorescence analysis did therefore not accurately represent the actual trypsinogen concentration. However, we gained new experimentally-relevant insights, which can be used to avoid misinterpretation of tracking and quantifying as well as online-monitoring of proteins with the frequently used fluorescent tags.</p></details></div>

Antibodies to any given DENV serotype which can afford protection against that serotype tend to enhance infection by other DENV serotypes, by a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Antibodies to the viral pre-membrane (prM) protein have been implicated in ADE. We show that co-expression of the envelope protein of all four DENV serotypes, in the yeast Pichia pastoris, leads to their co-assembly, in the absence of prM, into tetravalent mosaic VLPs (T-mVLPs), which retain the serotype-specific antigenic integrity and immunogenicity of all four types of their monomeric precursors. Following a three-dose immunisation schedule, the T-mVLPs elicited EDIII-directed antibodies in mice which could neutralise all four DENV serotypes. Importantly, anti-T-mVLP antibodies did not augment sub-lethal DENV-2 infection of dengue-sensitive AG129 mice, based on multiple parameters. The 'four-in-one' tetravalent T-mVLPs possess multiple desirable features which may potentially contribute to safety (non-viral, prM-lacking and ADE potential-lacking), immunogenicity (induction of virus-neutralising antibodies), and low cost (single tetravalent immunogen produced using P. pastoris, an expression system known for its high productivity using simple inexpensive media).

The procedures for preparation of methyl-specific isotopically-labeled proteins were established for the Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system, but typically it is not feasible to express eukaryotic proteins using E. coli. The Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) expression system is the most common yeast expression system, and is known to be superior to the E. coli system for the expression of mammalian proteins, including secretory and membrane proteins. However, this system has not yet been optimized for methyl-specific isotope labeling, especially for Val/Leu-methyl specific isotope incorporation. To overcome this difficulty, we explored various culture conditions for the yeast cells to efficiently uptake Val/Leu precursors. Among the searched conditions, we found that the cultivation pH has a critical effect on Val/Leu precursor uptake. At an acidic cultivation pH, the uptake of the Val/Leu precursor was increased, and methyl groups of Val and Leu in the synthesized recombinant protein yielded intense (1)H-(13)C correlation signals.

Only a few microorganisms are industrially relevant for recombinant protein production: methylotrophic yeasts are known to use methanol efficiently as the sole carbon and energy source. Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast characterized as being an economical, fast and effective system for heterologous protein expression. Many factors can affect both the product and the production, including the promoter, carbon source, pH, production volume, temperature, and many others; but to control all of them most of the time is difficult and this depends on the initial selection of each variable. Therefore, this review focuses on the selection of the best promoter in the recombination process, considering different inductors, and the temperature as a culture medium variable in methylotrophic Pichia pastoris yeast. The goal is to understand the effects associated with different factors that influence its cell metabolism and to reach the construction of an expression system that fulfills the requirements of the yeast, presenting an optimal growth and development in batch, fed-batch or continuous cultures, and at the same time improve its yield in heterologous protein production.</p></details></div>

This work aimed to evaluate the effect of various concentrations of ascorbic acid in mixed feeding strategy with sorbitol/methanol on productivity of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH). The relevant concentration of ascorbic acid (5, 10, or 20 mmol) and 50 g/L sorbitol were added in batch-wise mode to the medium at the beginning of induction phase. The rate of methanol addition was increased stepwise during the first 12 h of production and then kept constant. Total protein and r-hGH concentrations were analyzed and the results compared with sorbitol/methanol feeding using one-way analysis of variance. Moreover, an effective clarification process using activated carbon was developed to remove process contaminants like pigments and endotoxins. Finally, a three-step chromatographic process was applied to purify the product. According to the obtained results, addition of 10 mmol ascorbic acid to sorbitol/methanol co-feeding could significantly increase cell biomass (1.7 fold), total protein (1.14 fold), and r-hGH concentration (1.43 fold). One percent activated carbon could significantly decrease pigments and endotoxins without any significant changes in r-hGH assay. The result of the study concluded that ascorbic acid in combination with sorbitol could effectively enhance the productivity of r-hGH. This study also demonstrated that activated carbon clarification is a simple method for efficient removal of endotoxin and pigment in production of recombinant protein in the yeast expression system.</p></details></div>

CTendo7 belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 7, and exhibited considerable activity against sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) and xylan of 1.91IU/mg and 3.05IU/mg at the optimum reaction condition of 55 degrees C, pH5.0, respectively.

Additionally, Ag(+), Fe(3+) and Cu(2+) negatively affected the enzyme's activity, while the presence of 1mM and 5mM Mn(2+) significantly enhanced both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. Generation of soluble oligosaccharides from lignocellulose is a critical step in bioethanol production, and it is noteworthy that CTendo7 produced cello-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides from the continuous enzymatic saccharification of CMC-Na and xylan, respectively.

Circular plasmids containing the P. pastoris-specific autonomously replicating sequence (PARS1) permit transformation of P. pastoris with higher efficiency than obtained following chromosomal integration by linearized DNA. Unfortunately, however, existing autonomously replicating plasmids are known to be inherently unstable. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data and genome sequence information to independently identify, on each of the four chromosomes, centromeric DNA sequences consisting of long inverted repeat sequences. By examining the chromosome 2 centromeric DNA sequence (Cen2) in detail, we demonstrate that an approximately 111-bp region located at one end of the putative centromeric sequence had autonomous replication activity. In addition, the full-length Cen2 sequence, which contains two long inverted repeat sequences and a nonrepetitive central core region, is needed for the accurate replication and distribution of plasmids in P. pastoris Thus, we constructed a new, stable, autonomously replicating plasmid vector that harbors the entire Cen2 sequence; this episome facilitates genetic manipulation in P. pastoris, providing high transformation efficiency and plasmid stability.IMPORTANCE Secretory production of recombinant proteins is the most important application of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, a species that permits mass production of heterologous proteins. To date, the genetic engineering of P. pastoris has relied largely on integrative vectors due to the lack of user-friendly tools. Autonomously replicating Pichia plasmids are expected to facilitate genetic manipulation; however, the existing systems, which use autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) such as the P. pastoris-specific ARS (PARS1), are known to be inherently unstable for plasmid replication and distribution. Recently, the centromeric DNA sequences of P. pastoris were identified in back-to-back studies published by several groups; therefore, a new episomal plasmid vector with centromere DNA as a tool for genetic manipulation of P. pastoris is ready to be developed.</p></details></div>

In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/p-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme' active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</p></details></div>

In particular, members of the Lactobacillaceae family are the primary bacteria of concern. Currently, antibiotics and acid washing are two major means of controlling contaminants. However, antibiotic use could lead to increased antibiotic resistance, and the acid wash step stresses the fermenting yeast and has limited effectiveness. Bacteriophage endolysins such as LysA2 are lytic enzymes with the potential to contribute as antimicrobials to the fuel ethanol industries. Our goal was to evaluate the potential of yeast-derived LysA2 as a means of controlling Lactobacillaceae contamination. LysA2 intracellularly produced by Pichia pastoris showed activity comparable to Escherichia coli produced LysA2. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) with the A4alpha peptidoglycan chemotype (L-Lys-D-Asp crosslinkage) were the most sensitive to LysA2, though a few from that chemotype were insensitive. Pichia-expressed LysA2, both secreted and intracellularly produced, successfully improved ethanol productivity and yields in glucose (YPD60) and sucrose-based (sugarcane juice) ethanol fermentations in the presence of a LysA2 susceptible LAB contaminant. LysA2 secreting Sacharomyces cerevisiae did not notably improve production in sugarcane juice, but it did control bacterial contamination during fermentation in YPD60. Secretion of LysA2 by the fermenting yeast, or adding it in purified form, are promising alternative tools to control LAB contamination during ethanol fermentation. Endolysins with much broader lytic spectrums than LysA2 could supplement or replace the currently used antibiotics or the acidic wash.</p></details></div>

The recombinant protein displayed hydrolytic activities toward various substrates such as carboxymethyl cellulose, phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, glucomannan, lichenan, and beta-glucan. In particular, the enzyme had a unique catalytic efficiency on beta-1,4-glucans rather than mixed beta-1,3/1,4-glucans as compared to other GH45 endoglucanases. The fungal enzyme was relatively thermostable, retaining more than 91.4% activity at 80 degrees C for 1 h.

Progressively decreasing the size of the N-linked N297 oligosaccharide from high mannose (Man8-Man12), to Man5, to GlcNAc, to nonglycosylated N297Q resulted in progressive increases in backbone flexibility. Comparison of these results with recently published physicochemical stability and Fcgamma receptor binding data with the same set of glycoproteins provide improved insights into correlations between glycan structure and these pharmaceutical properties. Flexibility significantly increased upon glycan truncation in 2 potential aggregation-prone regions. In addition, a correlation was established between increased local backbone flexibility and increased deamidation at asparagine 315. Interestingly, the opposite trend was observed for oxidation of tryptophan 277 where faster oxidation correlated with decreased local backbone flexibility. Finally, a trend of increasing C'E glycopeptide loop flexibility with decreasing glycan size was observed that correlates with their FcgammaRIIIa receptor binding properties.

In the present study, a cysteine-rich motif associated immunoglobulin domain containing protein (designated CgCAICP-1) was identified in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The deduced protein sequence of CgCAICP-1 contained 534 amino acidresidues, with three Ig domains which were designated as IG1, IG2 and IG3, and a cysteine-rich motif between the first and second Ig domain. The mRNA transcripts of CgCAICP-1 were highly expressed in hemocytes and up-regulated significantly (p<0.05) after the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), but not peptidoglycan (PGN). The recombinant CgCAICP-1 protein (rCgCAICP-1) exhibited binding activity to various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including LPS, PGN, mannose (Man) and D-galactose (D-Gal), and microorganisms including Vibrio splendidus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The phagocytic rates of oyster hemocytes towards Gram-negative bacteria V. splendidus and Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus were significantly enhanced (p<0.05) after pre-incubation of microbes with rCgCAICP-1. Furthermore, the transcripts of CgCAICP-1 exhibited high level of polymorphism among individuals. The ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances (dN/dS) for AA'BCC'D strands of IG1 (the possible binding sites 1, pbs1) across all allelic variants was 2.09 (p<0.05), while the ratio for the non-pbs regions was less than 1.0. The 1248 bp fragment amplified from the 5' end of CgCAICP-1 open reading frame (ORF) from 24 transcript variants could be divided artificially into seven regions of 50 elements, and all of the allelic variants might be derived from these elements by point mutation and recombination processes. These results collectively suggested that CgCAICP-1 might function as an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to recognize various PAMPs and facilitated the phagocytosis of oyster hemocytes towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Diverse isoforms of CgCAICP-1 were generated through point mutation and recombination processes and maintained by balancing selection, which would provide a broader spectrum of interaction surface and be associated with immune resistance of oysters to infectious pathogens.</p></details></div>

Gcw13, one of these GPI-anchored proteins, was found to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of the histidine auxotrophic P. pastoris strain GS115 on methanol as the sole carbon source. To investigate the biological function of Gcw13, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to compare the difference of gene expression between GS115 and GCW13-deletion strain D13. RNA-Seq analysis showed that, in strain D13, the expression of genes involved in the methanol utilization pathway or peroxisome biogenesis was not changed, and a high proportion of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids were down-regulated, whereas GAP1, which encodes a general amino acid permease, was significantly up-regulated. Besides, the intracellular concentrations of various amino acids were significantly higher in D13 than that in GS115. We also observed that deletion of GCW13 resulted in more Gap1 presented on the cell surface and more active uptake of the toxic proline analogue l-azetidine-2-carboxylate acid (AzC). These results suggest that Gcw13 suppresses the expression of GAP1 and facilitates the endocytosis of Gap1 on methanol, resulting in decreasing Gap1-dependent uptake of amino acids in P. pastoris, which might contribute to the poor growth of GS115 on methanol.</p></details></div>

Activation of the mating response requires the secretion of a- and alpha-factor pheromones, which bind to G-protein coupled receptors on cells of opposite mating type. In K. phaffii, the genes coding for the alpha-factor (MFalpha), the pheromone surface receptors and the conserved a-factor biogenesis pathway have been annotated previously. Initial homology-based search failed to identify potential a-factor genes (MFA). By using transcriptome data of heterothallic strains under mating conditions, we found two K. phaffiia-factor genes. Deletion of both MFA genes prevented mating of a-type cells. MFA single mutants were still able to mate and activate the mating response pathway in alpha-type cells. A reporter assay was used to confirm the biological activity of synthetic a- and alpha-factor peptides. The identification of the a-factor genes enabled the first characterization of the role and regulation of the mating pheromone genes and the response of K. phaffii to synthetic pheromones and will help to gain a better understanding of the mating behavior of K. phaffii.</p></details></div>

As nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce, cellulose is expected to become a major raw material for food, energy, fuel and other products. 1,4-beta-glucosidase (Bgl), as a kind of cellulose, can be degraded cellulose into industrial available glucose. In this study, we constructed mutants of Bgl with enhanced activity based on homology modeling, molecular docking, and the site-directed mutagenesis of target residues to modify spatial positions, steric hindrances, or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. On the basis of the high-activity mutations were got (N347S and G235M) by using site-directed mutagenesis and screening methods and introduced in the Pichia pastoris expression system, the enzymatic properties of mutant enzymes were analysed. Assays of the activity of the purified Bgl revealed that the two mutants exhibited increased activity. The pPICZalphaA-G235M and pPICZalphaA-N347S mutants exhibited a >33.4% and 44.8% increase in specific activity respectively, with similar pH, temperature and metal ion requirements, compared to wild-type Bgl.

SAF was uniquely created by replacing the h4 helix of the HPV-16 capsid L1 protein with an L2 peptide. Two different feeding strategies in fed-batch cultures of P. pastoris Mut(s) were evaluated: a predetermined feed rate vs. feeding based on the oxygen consumption by maintaining constant dissolved oxygen levels (DO stat). All cultures showed a significant increase in biomass when methanol was fed using the DO stat method. In P. pastoris the SAF concentrations were higher in the Mut(s) strains than in the Mut(+) strains. However, H. polymorpha produced the highest level of SAF at 132.10 mg L(-1) culture while P. pastoris Mut(s) only produced 23.61 mg L(-1) . H. polymorpha showed greater potential for the expression of HPV-16 L1/L2 chimeric proteins despite the track record of P. pastoris as a high-level producer of heterologous proteins.</p></details></div>

The combination of parallelizable ion analysis without time loss together with different fragmentation techniques (HCD/CID) and an inclusion list led to higher quality in lipid identifications exemplified in human plasma and yeast samples. Moreover, we used lipidome isotope-labeling of yeast (LILY)-a fast and efficient in vivo labeling strategy in Pichia pastoris-to produce (nonradioactive) isotopically labeled eukaryotic lipid standards in yeast. We integrated the (13)C lipids in the LC-MS workflow to enable relative and absolute compound-specific quantification in yeast and human plasma samples by isotope dilution. Label-free and compound-specific quantification was validated by comparison against a recent international interlaboratory study on human plasma SRM 1950. In this way, we were able to prove that LILY enabled quantification leads to accurate results, even in complex matrices. Excellent analytical figures of merit with enhanced trueness, precision and linearity over 4-5 orders of magnitude were observed applying compound-specific quantification with (13)C-labeled lipids. We strongly believe that lipidomics studies will benefit from incorporating isotope dilution and LC-MSn strategies.</p></details></div>

Golgins are large Golgi-resident proteins, primarily reported to play role in cargo vesicle capture, but details of such mechanisms are yet to be deciphered. Golgins that localize to the Golgi via their GRIP domain, a C-terminal Golgi anchoring domain, are known as GRIP domain Golgins. In this present study, we have identified and functionally characterized a homologue of one such GRIP domain Golgin protein, Imh1, from the budding yeast P. pastoris. We have demonstrated that the GRIP domain present at the C-terminal of P. pastoris Imh1 (PpImh1) functions as its Golgi-targeting sequence. Using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy, we have shown that PpImh1 can self-associate and form a homodimer. Analysis of purified recombinant PpImh1 by CD spectroscopy indicates the presence of an 85% alpha-helical structure, a characteristic of high-content alpha-helical coiled-coil sequences normally present in other Golgin family proteins. Two-hybrid analysis indicated self-interaction between C-terminal fragments, yet N-terminal fragments do not mediate any such form of self-interaction, suggesting that PpImh1 may form a parallel dimer. Electron microscopy data indicates that PpImh1 forms extended rod-like homo-dimeric molecules with splayed N-terminal end which can act as a tether for capturing vesicles. Our study provides the first evidence in support of the dimeric Y-shaped structure for any Golgin in the budding yeast.</p></details></div>

However, little is known about the FIPs from G. applanatum. In this study, two novel FIP genes, termed as FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2, were cloned from G. applanatum, characterized and functionally expressed after codon optimization in Pichia pastoris GS115. Results showed that FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2 comprised 342-bp encoding peptides of 113 amino acids, which shared a high homology with other Ganoderma FIPs. The yield of recombinant FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2 increased significantly after codon optimization and reached 247.4 and 197.5 mg/L, respectively. Bioactivity assay in vitro revealed that both rFIP-gap1 and rFIP-gap2 could agglutinate mouse, sheep, and human red blood cells. Besides, rFIP-gap1 and rFIP-gap2 obviously stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenocytes and enhanced IL-2 and IFN-gamma release. Cytotoxicity detection indicated that IC50 of rFIP-gap1 towards A549 and HeLa cancer cells were 29.89 and 8.34 mug/mL, respectively, whereas IC50 of rFIP-gap2 to the same cancer cells were 60.92 and 41.05 mug/mL, respectively.

Quantitative assays based on LC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QQQ-MS) and LC-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) were validated using the Standard Reference Material, SRM 1950 - metabolites in frozen human plasma. 14 amino acids (as given in the certificate) were quantified using separations by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The latter chromatographic separation provided retention and selectivity for the amino acid panel, while the studied approaches employing RPLC relied on the selectivity of the MS detection. Cross-validation using the different MS platforms showed that in all cases the application of in-vivo labelled standards resulted in a significant improvement of trueness and precision. LODs and LOQs ranged, regardless of the detection system and addition of internal standards, in the same order of magnitude. The linear dynamic range of the employed detection systems was enhanced at least for one order of magnitude for several analytes when the internal standards were applied.</p></details></div>

The secretory recombinant plasmid pPIC9-gp85 containing ALV-J gp85 gene was designed and was transfected into the genome of P. pastoris (GS115) cells. The recombinant plasmid was expressed under the induction of methanol. The expressed products in the medium of the cells were purified and identified with endoglycosidase digestion assay and western blot mediated with monoclonal antibody (MAb) JE9. The purified product combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant was inoculated intramuscularly into 7-day-old chickens and three booster inoculations were performed on 21 days post first inoculation (dpfi), 42, and 56 dpfi. The antibody responses and cellular immune responses were detected, and the protective effects were analyzed after challenge with ALV-J. The results showed that the secretory pPIC9-gp85 plasmid was successfully constructed and could be stably expressed in GS115 cells. The expressed products were N-acetylglucosylated and could specifically combine with MAb (JE9). The secreted gp85 protein combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could induce higher antibody response and spleen lymphocyte proliferation response and IFN-gamma-inducing response, and could protect all the inoculated chickens against the viremia and the immunosuppressive lesions caused by ALV-J challenge. The results of neutralizing test in vitro suggested that the antisera with some ALV-J antibody titers could neutralize ALV-J strain and inhibit the growth of virus in vitro. The result of IFA showed that IgG antibody in the antisera could specifically combine with ALV-J strain in cells. It can be concluded that the secretory recombinant gp85 protein, as a new acetylglucosylated gp85 protein, was successfully prepared and combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could protect the inoculated chickens against ALV-J infection. This study first reported the methods on preparing the secretory recombinant ALV-J gp85 protein using P. pastoris and evaluated its immunoprotection.</p></details></div>

The bovine enterokinase light chain (bEKL) produced in Pichia pastoris was shown to be a glycoprotein. To study the effects of N-glycosylation on the biochemical properties of bEKL, the enzyme was deglycosylated via site-directed mutagenesis. The results showed that elimination of the N-glycosylation sites of bEKL (N64, N103 and N165) did not significantly affect the protein secretion level in P. pastoris, but it does greatly influence its enzymatic activity. The N64Q increased the specific activity of the enzyme for GD4K-beta-naphthylamide and improved its catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the glycosylated bEKL is more thermostable than its deglycosylated counterparts. Structural analysis of glycosylated and deglycosylated bEKL revealed that the removal of N-glycosylation did not have pronounced changes on the secondary structure but there was a significant difference in the tertiary structure. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the effects of glycosylation at different degrees and sites in bEKL were diverse.

The Reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis of the fractions from these gradients was then used to generate large data sets of impurity profiles. A retention database of the biological product was also generated using the same linear salt and pH gradients on these resins, without fraction collection. The resulting two data sets were then analyzed using an in silico tool, which incorporated integrated manufacturing constraints to generate and rank potential three-step purification sequences based on their predicted purification performance as well as whole-process "orthogonality" for impurity removal. Highly ranked sequences were further examined to identify templates for process development. The efficacy of this approach was successfully demonstrated for the rapid development of robust integrated processes for human growth hormone and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.</p></details></div>

In the present study, single- and four-CRD-containing galectins were identified in oyster Crassostrea gigas (designated CgGal-2 and CgGal-3). The open reading frames (ORFs) of CgGal-2 and CgGal-3 encode polypeptides of 200 and 555 amino acids, respectively. All CRDs of CgGal-3 include two consensus motifs essential for ligand-binding, and a novel motif is present in CgGal-2. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) profiles were determined for recombinant rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3, and rCgGal-2 displayed low binding affinity for PAMPs, while rCgGal-3 bound various PAMPs including glucan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and peptidoglycan (PGN) with relatively high affinity. Furthermore, rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3 exhibited different microbe binding profiles; rCgGal-2 bound to Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Vibrio vulnificus) and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), while rCgGal-3 bound to these microbes but also to Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus). In addition, rCgGal-3 possessed microbial agglutinating activity and coagulation activity against fungi and erythrocytes, respectively, but rCgGal-2 lacked any agglutinating activity. Carbohydrate binding specificity analysis showed that rCgGal-3 specifically bound D-galactose. Furthermore, rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3 functioned as opsonin participating in the clearance against invaders in C. gigas. Thus, CgGal-2 with one CRD and CgGal-3 with four CRDs are new members of the galectin family involved in immune responses against bacterial infection. Differences in the organisation and amino acid sequences of CRDs may affect their specificity and affinity for nonself substances.</p></details></div>

Purified recombinant phytase displayed all its biochemical properties similar to wild type. Molecular modeling and docking of phytase with various substrates showed differential binding patterns with GoldScore values ranging from 40.61 to 79.78. Docking with different substrates revealed strong binding affinity with ATP and phytic acid, while the lowest with AMP and phosphoenol pyruvate. This was further confirmed using biochemical assays, as the recombinant enzyme displayed broad substrate specificity. Docking with inhibitors also showed differential binding with GoldScore values ranging from 22.94 (2,3-butanedione) to 85.72 (myo-inositol hexasulphate). Validation using biochemical analysis revealed that both 2,3-butanedione and phenyl glyoxal inhibited the phytase activity significantly. Furthermore, presence of inorganic phosphate in the reaction mixture also inhibited the phytase activity, as there was no activity at and beyond 0.8mM. Docking of phytase with metavanadate showed binding at the same atom in the active-site where the substrate i.e. phytic acid binds. Vanadium incorporation resulted in the catalytic conversion of phytase into a peroxidase with concomitant inhibition of phytase activity. Peroxidase activity was high in acidic range and the product formation showed correlation with reaction time.

The limited supply and potential infectious pathogen contamination of pHSA have stimulated the development of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA). However, rHSA often entraps endogenous or exogenous impurities, including color pigments and polysaccharides. Therefore, the purification of rHSA to high purity remains the bottleneck in large-scale production of rHSA. Herein we report a novel two-step purification protocol for rHSA generated from Pichia pastoris. In the first step, rHSA was partially unfolded to expose impurities entrapped into rHSA and was then removed. In the second step, rHSA was crystallized to further remove impurities. Through this procedure, the pigment content (A350/A280) and polysaccharides content of rHSA were reduced to 0.0141 and 0.253mug/mg, respectively, which were comparable to pHSA. In addition, the secondary structure and bioactivity of purified rHSA are preserved. The purification procedure developed in this study is a simple, short and low cost method to produce active rHSA, or rHSA-fusion proteins, to high purity, and also suitable for the purification of other disulfide-rich proteins.</p></details></div>

We report here the cloning and expression of lamprey (l)GpB5, and its ability to heterodimerize with lGpA2 to form a functional l-thyrostimulin. The full-length cDNA of lGpB5 encodes 174 amino acids with ten conserved cysteine residues and one glycosylation site that is conserved with other vertebrate GpB5 sequences. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses support that lGpB5 belongs to the vertebrate GpB5 clade. Heterodimerization of lGpB5 and lGpA2 was shown by nickel pull-down of histidine-tagged recombinant subunits. RNA transcripts of lGpB5 were detected in the pituitary of lampreys during both parasitic and adult life stages. Intraperitoneal injection with lGnRH-III (100mug/kg) increased pituitary lGpA2, lGpB5, and lGpHbeta mRNA expression in sexually mature, adult female lampreys. A recombinant l-thyrostimulin produced by expression of a fusion gene in Pichia pastoris activated lamprey GpH receptors I and II as measured by cAMP enzymeimmunoassay. In contrast to jawed vertebrates that have pituitary LH, FSH, and TSH, our data support that lampreys only have two functional pituitary GpHs, lGpH and l-thyrostimulin, which consist of lGpA2 and unique beta subunits. It is hypothesized that lGpH and l-thyrostimulin differentially regulate reproductive and thyroid activities in some unknown way(s) in lampreys.</p></details></div>

HNP1 plays a crucial role in controlling bacterial infections, particularly by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, through membrane perforation patterns. The structural characteristics of HNP1's three intramolecular disulfide bridges cause difficulty in its synthesis via chemical methods. In this study, bioactive recombinant HNP1 was produced using the Pichia pastoris (P. Pichia) expression system. HNP1 was fused with the polyhedrin of Bombyx mori and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to prevent HNP1 toxicity in yeast host cells under direct expression. An enterokinase protease cleavage site (amino acid sequence DDDDK) was designed upstream of the HNP1 peptide to obtain the antibacterial peptide HNP1 with native structure after it was cleaved by the enterokinase. The fusion HNP1 protein (FHNP1) was successfully expressed and had a molecular mass of approximately 62.6 kDa, as determined using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Then, the recovered FHNP1 was digested and purified; Tricine-SDS-PAGE results showed that HNP1 was successfully released from FHNP1. Functional analysis of induction against antibiotic-resistant Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) showed that it was challenging for HNP1 to acquire resistance to the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori. Moreover, in vitro studies showed that HNP1 exerted a strong effect against antibiotic-resistant H. pylori activity. Furthermore, the animal model of H. pylori infection established in vivo showed that HNP1 significantly reduced the colonization of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori in the stomach. Our study indicated that this could be a new potential avenue for large-scale production of HNP1 for therapeutic application against the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori infection in humans.</p></details></div>

Hence, there is an urgent need to search for new antimicrobial agents. Initially known as a defensive effector in the innate immunity of certain organs of the human body, human goose-type lysozyme 2 (hLysG2) has been shown to possess therapeutically useful potential against multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Developing a novel strategy for large-scale production that provides high yields of this protein with high purity, quality, and potency is critical for pharmaceutical applications. To overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression, here we report the production of recombinant hLysG2 (rhLysG2) using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host. The strong inducible alcoholoxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter was used to drive expression of the optimized hLysG2 gene. Under the optimal expression conditions, the lytic activity of rhLysG2 reached 113 U/mL of culture supernatant in shake flask cultivation and this was increased to 2084 U/mL in fed-batch fermentation. Using chitin affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography, rhLysG2 was produced with a yield of 137mg/L, purity of>99%, molecular weight of 21,504.6Da, and specific activity of 13,500U/mg. In vitro assays indicated that rhLysG2 possessed muramidase activity, isopeptidase activity, and free radical scavenging activity. This report describes an efficient strategy for the production of biologically active rhLysG2 in P. pastoris on a large scale with a high yield, which provides a solid foundation for possible future pharmaceutical applications.</p></details></div>

The open reading frame (ORF) of AjFL-1 was of 546 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 181 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 20kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of AjFL-1 shared 30%-40% similarity with the fucolectins from other animals. There were a typical F-type lectin domain (FLD) (residues 39-180) and a signal peptide (residues 1-24) in AjFL-1. The mRNA transcript of AjFL-1 could be detected by qRT-PCR in various tissues, such as intestinum, coelomocytes, respiratory tree, tentacle, and body wall, while undetectable in the gonads and longitudinal muscle. The mRNA expression level of AjFL-1 in coelomocytes was significantly up-regulated (47.06-fold to that in control group, p<0.05) at 12h after Vibrio splendidus challenge. Immunofluorescence assay showed that AjFL-1 protein was mainly distributed on the membrane, while few in cytoplasm of coelomocytes in sea cucumber. The recombinant AjFL-1 (rAjFL-1) could bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), mannan (MAN) and fucose (FUC), and exhibited a broader binding activities towards Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus, as well fungus Pichia pastoris. In addition, rAjFL-1 could strongly promote the agglutination of fungus P. pastoris. These results indicated that AjFL-1 was a novel member of fucose-binding lectin family, which functioned as a pattern recognition receptor with broad spectrum of microbial recognition, and involved in innate immune response of sea cucumber.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a novel Astakine gene was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (designated as EsAst). The full-length cDNA of EsAst was of 1163 bp, consisting of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 120 bp, a 3' UTR of 656 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 387 bp encoding a polypeptide of 128amino acids. There were a signal peptide and a prokineticin domain with nine conserved cysteine residues in the deduced amino acid sequence of EsAst. EsAst shared higher similarity with Astakines from Penaeus monodon and Pacifastacus leniusculus, and it was closely clustered with the Astakine from shrimp P. monodon in the phylogenetic tree. The EsAst mRNA transcript was higher expressed in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was continuously increased from 1.5 to 48h after Vibro anguillarum challenge compared that in the untreated control group. After Pichia pastoris GS115 challenge, the relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was also up-regulated. After rEsAst injection, ROS levels in HPT cells were also increased at 12 and 24h, and the total hemocyte counts were also significantly increased at 6, 9, 12, and 24h post rEsAst injection. The interference of EsAst expression with dsRNA injection could delay the recovery of hemocytes production post A. hydrophila stimulation. When mitochondrial complexes I was knock down by dsRNA, ROS levels were decreased and THCs were also decreased. Recovery of hemocyte production inducing by A. hydrophila stimulation and rEsAst injection were delayed with dsEsbc1 injection. When ROS levels were increased after RNAi of Lon protease, THCs were also increased. The expression levels of five genes (EsJNK, EsSTAT, EsPI3K, EsAKT1, EsP70S6K) involved in SAPK-JNK and mTOR signaling pathways were up-regulated at 12 and 24h in rEsAst group and EsLon dsRNA group compared with that in EGFP dsRNA group, and were similar to the trend of ROS levels.

In this work we examined the combined action of two auxiliary proteins from the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum: a family AA9 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (GtLPMO) and a GH10 xylanase (GtXyn10A). The enzymes were produced in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris. In the presence of an electron source, GtLPMO increased the activity of a commercial cellulase on filter paper, and the xylanase activity of GtXyn10A on beechwood xylan. Mixtures of GtLPMO, GtXyn10A and Celluclast 1.5L were used for hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw. Results showed that a mixture of 60% Celluclast 1.5L, 20% GtXyn10A and 20% GtLPMO increased total reducing sugar production by 54%, while the conversions of glucan to glucose and xylan to xylose were increased by 40 and 57%, respectively. This suggests that GtLPMO can contribute to lignocellulose hydrolysis, not only by oxidative activity on glycosidic bonds, but also to hemicellulose through the oxidation of xylosyl bonds in xylan. The concerted action of these auxiliary enzymes may significantly improve large-scale recovery of sugars from lignocellulose.</p></details></div>

Eleven different signal peptides, including the murine IgG1 signal peptide, were combinatorially evaluated for their effect on antibody titer. Strains using different combinations of signal peptides were identified that secreted approximately 2-7 fold higher levels of VRC01 than the previous best secretor, with the highest yield of 6.50mgL(-1) in shake flask expression. Interestingly it was determined that the highest yields were achieved when the murine IgG1 signal peptide was fused to the light chain, with several different signal peptides leading to high yield when fused to the heavy chain. Finally, we have evaluated the effect of using a 2A signal peptide to create a bicistronic vector in the attempt to reduce burden and increase transformation efficiency, but found it to give reduced yields compared to using two independent vectors.</p></details></div>

Under these conditions, the protease activity of rAp in the fermentation broth reached 400.4+/-40.5 U/mL after induction for three days. The rAp was isolated and purified, and its enzymatic characteristics were tested. Its optimal pH was 10.0, and it remained stable in a pH range of 7.0-10.0. Its optimal temperature was 45 degrees C and it retained >50% activity at 40 degrees C for 60min. The rAp activity was significantly inhibited by PMSF, Zn(2+) and Fe(2+) and the rAp had a broad substrate specificity for natural proteins and synthetic peptide substrates, and preferred substrates at P1 position with large hydrophobic side-chain groups. Compared to Papain (8.7%) and Alcalase (12.2%), the degree of hydrolysis of rAp to soy protein isolate was 16.5%; therefore, rAp was a good candidate for the processing of food industry byproducts.</p></details></div>

The maximum intracellular beta-d-mannanase activity obtained from the cell-free extract was approximately 40.0U/mL after 72h of cultivating a P. pastoris transformant (pPICZ-man) induced with methanol. Hydrolysis of native LBG galactomannan with 8U/mL beta-d-mannanase for 24h significantly decreased the weight-average molecular weight of LBG galactomannan from 5,580,010 to 3188. Native and hydrolyzed LBG galactomannan in a range of 0-0.2% did not trigger significant cytotoxicity after 24h of treatment compared with the control. The native LBG galactomannan stimulated RAW 264.7 cells to produce cytokine TNF-alpha dose-dependently, but there was no significant IL-1beta or nitric oxide production. The native LBG galactomannan also stimulated beta-hexosaminidase secretion in RBL-2H3 cells. After the native LBG galactomannan was hydrolyzed with beta-d-mannanase, all of the immunological properties disappeared.

Despite its highly selective mechanism of action, the presence of this flavooxidase in different biotechnological settings has hitherto been hampered by the lack of appropriate heterologous expression systems. We recently described the functional expression of the AAO from Pleurotus eryngii in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by fusing a chimeric signal peptide (prealphaproK) and applying structure-guided evolution. Here, we have obtained an AAO secretion variant that is readily expressed in S. cerevisiae and overproduced in Pichia pastoris. First, the functional expression of AAO in S. cerevisiae was enhanced through the in vivo shuffling of a panel of secretion variants, followed by the focused evolution of the prealphaproK peptide. The outcome of this evolutionary campaign-an expression variant that accumulated 4 mutations in the chimeric signal peptide, plus two mutations in the mature protein- showed 350-fold improved secretion (4.5 mg/L) and was stable. This secretion mutant was cloned into P. pastoris and fermented in a fed-batch bioreactor to enhance production to 25 mg/L. While both recombinant AAO from S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris were subjected to the same N-terminal processing and had a similar pH activity profile, they differed in their kinetic parameters and thermostability. The strong glycosylation observed in the evolved AAO from S. cerevisiae underpinned this effect, since when the mutant was produced in the glycosylation-deficient S. cerevisiae strain Deltakre2, its kinetic parameters and thermostability were comparable to its poorly glycosylated P. pastoris recombinant counterpart.</p></details></div>

As such, the goal of this study was to design, express, and purify a recombinant VpDef (rVpDef) in Pichia pastoris and to determine its antibacterial potency and stability. A 6.9KDa rVpDef was successfully expressed as a secreted peptide in P. pastoris, and the amount of rVpDef accumulation was shown to reach as high as approximate 60mug per 1ml of culture medium only after an initial optimization was performed. The purified rVpDef demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was active against six typical common bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. A minimal inhibition concentration of as low as 50mug/ml was observed for rVpDef against the growth of E. coli O157 (ATCC 35150). Moreover, rVpDef was tolerant to temperature shock and proteinase digestion and maintained a high stability over a relatively broad pH range. In addition, rVpDef had a low hemolytic activity against rabbit erythrocytes. Taken together, this study demonstrated that rVpDef could be produced in a large-scale manner in P. pastoris and has a good antibacterial activity and suitable stability. This is the first report on heterologous expression of a biologically active VpDef in P. pastoris, supporting its use for both research and application purposes.</p></details></div>

This result is more promising than the previous reports of industrial applications, which reported the highest yield as 92.29 mg/L/h, considering that the space-time yield of rHSA was doubled. In addition, the desired protein was purified by filtration and Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, which yielded a 58% recovery of a product that had over a 96% purity. This study reveals that Pichia pastoris is an excellent system for recombinant human serum albumin expression due to its outstanding expression capacity. In addition, the high efficiency level of rHSA production lays a solid foundation for its use in industrial production.</p></details></div>

Recently, a protein harboring DM9 repeats was identified as mannose-specific lectin (CgCGL1, renamed as CgDM9CP-1) from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. In the present study, another DM9 containing protein was identified from oyster C. gigas (designated as CgDM9CP-2). The open reading frame of CgDM9CP-2 gene was of 432 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids with two tandem DM9 repeats. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgDM9CP-2 shared 60.8% identity with that of CgDM9CP-1. In the unrooted phylogenetic tree, CgDM9CP-2 was closely clustered with CgDM9CP-1, and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate DM9CPs. The mRNA transcripts of CgDM9CP-2 were expressed in all the tested tissues, including mantle, gonad, gills, adductor muscle, hemocytes, and hepatopancreas, with the highest expression level in gills. CgDM9CP-2 protein was mainly distributed on the cytomembrane of oyster hemocytes. After mannose stimulation, the mRNA expression of CgDM9CP-2 in gills was up-regulated to the peak level (5.90-fold of that in SSW group, p<0.05) at 24h, and kept at a significantly higher level compared with that in control group at 6-48h. It significantly increased at 6h (2.33-fold, p<0.05), and 12h (3.08-fold, p<0.05) post Vibrio splendidus stimulation, and then gradually decreased from 48 to 72h (p<0.05) with significant difference comparing with that in control group. The recombinant CgDM9CP-2 protein (rCgDM9CP-2) displayed higher binding affinity to D-(+)-mannose while lower binding affinity to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. rCgDM9CP-2 also exhibited binding activity towards fungi (Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus), and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas hydrophila and V. splendidus). It could agglutinate fungi P. pastoris and Y. lipolytica, and inhibit the growth of P. pastoris, S. aureus, V. anguillarum, and V. splendidus. These results collectively indicated that CgDM9CP-2 not only served as a pattern recognition receptor with a broad range of recognition spectrum, but also involved in inhibiting the growth of invading microbe in the innate immune response of oyster, which would provide further evidence for the function of DM9 domain in the innate immune system.</p></details></div>

However, the application of lunasin is limited by its high cost. In this study, we developed a successful protocol for expression of a dimer formation protein containing 4 tandem repeated lunasin analogs (lunasin-4) in Pichia pastoris. The expression level at the optimal condition (initial pH 7.0, 1.0% final methanol concentration and induction for 72 h at 26 degrees C) was 0.24 mg/mL cell-free broth. Lunasin analog, obtained from purified lunasin-4 protein through enterokinase digestion and ultrafiltration, significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, intracellular signaling array analysis demonstrated down-regulated levels of phosphorylated Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k) and an up-regulated level of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) after lunasin analog treatment. These results suggest that lunasin analog exerted anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells partly via inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR/p70s6k signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study provides a potential strategy for recombinant production of bioactive lunasin in industry.</p></details></div>

Commercial chondroitin sulfate has been mainly acquired from animal tissue extraction. Here we report a new two-step biological strategy for producing chondroitin sulfate A and chondroitin sulfate C. First, the chondroitin biosynthesis pathway in a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain using sucrose as carbon source was systematically optimized and the titer of chondroitin was significantly enhanced to 7.15 g/L. Then, specific sulfation transformation systems were successfully constructed and optimized by combining the purified aryl sulfotransferase IV (ASST IV), chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST). Chondroitin sulfate A and C were enzymatically transformed from chondroitin at conversion rates of 98% and 96%, respectively.

To penetrate the cell wall and thereby to facilitate infection, microbial pathogens are equipped with a wide array of cell wall-degrading enzymes to depolymerize the polysaccharides in the cell wall. However, many of these enzymes and their role in the pathogenesis of microbial pathogens are not characterized, especially those from Oomycetes. In this study, we analyzed the function of four putative endo-beta-1,4-xylanase-encoding genes (ppxyn1-ppxyn4) from Phytophthora parasitica, an oomycete plant pathogen known to cause severe disease in a wide variety of plant species. All four genes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10). Recombinant proteins of ppxyn1, ppxyn2, and ppxyn4 obtained from the yeast Pichia pastoris showed degrading activities toward birch wood xylan, but they behaved differently in terms of the conditions for optimal activity, thermostability, and durability. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed upregulated expression of all four genes, especially ppxyn1 and ppxyn2, during plant infection. In contrast, ppxyn3 was highly expressed in cysts and its close homolog, ppxyn4, in germinating cysts. To uncover the role of ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the pathogenesis of P. parasitica, we generated silencing transformants for these two genes by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing. Silencing ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 reduced the virulence of P. parasitica toward tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and tomato plants. These results demonstrate the crucial role of xylanase-encoding ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the infection process of P. parasitica.</p></details></div>

After an appropriate cloning strategy, this genetically engineered inulinase was successfully overproduced in fed-batch fermentations, reaching up to 840 U/ml after a 72-h cultivation. The protein, purified to homogeneity by chromatographic techniques, was obtained at a 42% yield. The following biochemical characteristics were determined: the enzyme had an optimal pH of 3, was stable for at least 3hat 55 degrees C, and was inhibited in catalytic activity almost completely by Hg(+2). The respective Km and Vmax for the recombinant inulinase with inulin as substrate were 1.35mM and 2673mumol/min/mg. The recombinant enzyme is an exoinulinase but also possesses synthetic activity (i. e., fructosyl transferase).

Here, we used a new combined strategy to overexpress ROL in Pichia pastoris. An efficient method based on bio-brick was developed to construct a series of vectors harboring different copy numbers of ROL gene cassettes, which were then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 to generate a strain with specific copy numbers of ROL. An optimized gene-dosage recombinant strain of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# harboring five copies of ROL was screened, revealing production of the highest activity (2700 U/mL), which was 8-fold higher than that of the strain harboring one copy. The activity of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# was then enhanced to 3080 U/mL in a shaking flask under optimized culture conditions. Subsequently, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein-degradation-related genes Ubc1 or/and Hrd1 were co-expressed with ROL to further increase ROL expression. The activities of the recombinant strains, GS115/5ROL-Ubc1 22#, -Hrd1 15#, and -Hrd1-Ubc1 1#, were 4000 U/mL, 4200 U/mL, and 4750 U/mL, which was 29.9%, 36.4%, and 54.2% higher, respectively, than that observed in GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11#. Using the combined strategy, ROL expression was improved 15.8-fold, with maximum GS115/5ROL-Hrd1-Ubc1 1# activity reaching 33,900 U/mL via a sorbitol/methanol co-feeding strategy in a 3-L fermenter and resulting in a 1.65-, 1.26-, and 1.14-fold enhancement relative to the activities observed in strains GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11#, GS115/5ROL-Ubc1 22#, and GS115/5ROL-Hrd1 15#, respectively.

Neutron scattering, and in particular neutron diffraction can provide unique and detailed information on the structure of lipid membranes. However, deuterated samples are desirable to fully exploit this powerful method. Recently, the extraction of lipids from microorganisms grown in deuterated media was demonstrated to be both an attracting route to obtain complex lipid mixtures resembling the composition of natural membranes, and to producing deuterated molecules in a very convenient way. A full characterization of these deuterated extracts is hence pivotal for their use in building up model membrane systems. Here we report the structural characterization of lipid extracts obtained from Pichia pastoris by means of neutron diffraction measurements. In particular, we compare the structure of membranes extracted from yeast cells grown in a standard culture medium and in a corresponding deuterated culture medium. The results show that the different molecular composition of the deuterated and protiated lipid extracts induce different structural organization of the lipid membranes. In addition, we compare these membranes composed of extracted yeast lipids with stacked bilayers prepared from synthetic lipid mixtures.</p></details></div>

Due to lack of glycosylation, rhIL-11 is suitable to be expressed by yeast cells. However, the only available yeast-derived rhIL-11 presents an obstacle in low production yield, as well as an unamiable process, such as the use of reverse-phase chromatography employing plenty of toxic organic solvents. Our findings showed that the low yield was due to self-aggregation of rhIL-11. A novel process recovering bioactive rhIL-11 from the yeast secretory medium therefore has been developed and demonstrated, involving fermentation from Pichia pastoris, followed by a two-phase extraction to precipitate rhIL-11. After renaturing, the protein of interest was purified by a two-column step, comprising a cation-exchanger, and a hydrophobic interaction chromatography in tandem at high sample loads that was facile and cost-effective in future scale-up. Identity and quality assessments confirmed the expected amino acid sequence without N-terminal heterogeneity, as well as high quality in potency and purity.

We constructed pC- and pN-procollagen (without N- or C-propeptides, respectively) as well as CTEs located in the triple helical domain lacking both propeptides and telopeptides, and expressed these in yeast Pichia pastoris host strain GS115 (his4, Mut(+)) simultaneously with recombinant chicken prolyl-4-hydroxylase alpha and beta subunits. Both pC- and pN-procollagen monomers accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, whereas CTE was assembled into homotrimers with stable conformation and secreted into the supernatants, suggesting that the large molecular weight pC-or pN-procollagens were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the smaller CTEs proceeded through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, resulting recombinant chicken type II collagen pCalpha1(II) can induced collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, which seems to be as effective as the current standard nCCII. Notably, protease digestion assays showed that rCCII could assemble in the absence of C- and N-propeptides or telopeptides.

We produced carp rLH and rFSH as single-chain polypeptides, wherein the GTH subunit alpha was joined with either cLHbeta or cFSHbeta mature protein-coding sequences to form a fusion gene that encodes a yoked polypeptide, in which the GTH beta-subunit forms the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit forms the C-terminal part. Competitive ELISAs were developed, using primary antibodies against rcLHbeta or rcFSHbeta, respectively, and rcLHbetaalpha or rcFSHbetaalpha for the standard curves. The standard curves for cLH paralleled those of pituitary extracts of the homologous fish and also those of other cyprinids species like the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).

Both FSH and LH cells are localized in the center of the proximal pars distalis enveloping both sides of the neurohypophysis. LH cells form a continuous population throughout the PPD, while FSH cells are more loosely distributed throughout the same area and form small aggregations. Marked annual changes were encountered in gonadosomatic index (GSI), follicle diameter, mRNA levels and protein levels of FSH and LH. From September to November, all fish had low GSI, and the ovary contained previtellogenic follicles. From December, the GSI level increased and remained high until March, the follicular diameter reached its maximum in January, where the ovary contained large fully grown follicles. Thereafter, spawning occurred through March and April and ended in May, and GSI level and follicle diameter increased again; and the ovary contained mid-vitellogenic follicles. LH pituitary content and mRNA levels were low at pre- and early vitellogenesis, increasing gradually during this process to reach a peak of LH mRNA levels in mid vitellogenic ovary and a peak of LH content in fully grown ovarian follicles. However, no significant change occurred in FSH pituitary content and mRNA levels in vitellogenic fish and in fish during final maturation stages. A dramatic difference was found in the total content of each gonadotropin in the pituitary, with higher LH than FSH. Moreover, follicle diameter was positively and significantly correlated with LH pituitary content and its transcript levels - but not with the pituitary content or mRNA levels of FSH. Taken together, these results indicate that in carp, LH alone is sufficient to regulate both vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation while FSH may have another, yet undefined role.</p></details></div>
