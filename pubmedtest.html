The expressed protein was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis showed PMO9A_MALCI to be ~27kDa protein. High performance anion exchange chromatography and mass spectrometry confirmed that purified protein was active against an array of cellulosic (avicel, carboxy methyl cellulose) and hemicellulosic (birch wood xylan, wheat arabinoxylan and rye arabinoxylan) substrates, releasing both oxidized and unoxidized cello-oligosaccharide and xylo-oligosaccharide products respectively. Presence of double oxidized products during mass spectrometric analysis as well as in-silico analysis confirmed that the expressed protein belongs to Type 3 LPMO family. Molecular dynamic simulations further confirmed the sharing of common amino acid residues conserved for catalysis of both cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates which further indicates that both substrates are equally preferred. Enzymatic cocktails constituted by replacing a part of commercial cellulase CellicCTec2 with PMO9A_MALCI (9:1/8:2) led to synergistic improvement in saccharification of acid and alkali pretreated biomass. This is the first report on heterologous expression of LPMO from M. cinnamomea, exhibiting catalysis of cellulose and pure xylan.</p></details></div>

The application of this expression platform is restricted by the toxicity and inflammatory nature of methanol, especially in food and pharmaceutical products. Human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) is an important pharmaceutical protein, playing a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of innate immune cells. In this study, a methanol-free expression platform for extracellular expression of hGM-CSF was developed. To attain this goal, a novel constructed expression vector pEP(alpha)101, carrying the FMD promoter regulating recombinant expression by glycerol derepression was designed. The optimized hGM-CSF gene was subcloned into pEP(alpha)101 and transformed into P. pastoris. The expression of rhGM-CSF in three different culture media were investigated. Based on the observed heterogeneous glycosylation pattern on SDS-PAGE and western blot, the glycoproteins were deglycosylated to remove carbohydrate units. According to the results, the novel methanol independent PFMD expression platform would be a suitable candidate for driving heterologous gene expression especially for the production of food-grade and therapeutically important recombinant proteins.</p></details></div>

DesB30 is an insulin analogue in which the B chain lacks amino acid 30 (Thr) compared with human insulin. This analogue can be used to produce the long-acting insulin Degludec or Detemir. In this study, a spacer peptide was added before the sequence of DesB30 and the C-peptide was replaced with AAK, a short connecting peptide. The target gene was cloned under the control of AOX1 and expressed as a secretory protein in Pichia pastoris. A high-yield recombination strain was selected by screening for resistance to G418. The basal salts medium was optimized and a lower salt concentration medium was found to show the best effects. Both media were used to compare the yield of high-density fermentation. The maximum yield reached 4.51g/L in 1/2 basal salt medium, which is the highest reported yield to date. The insulin precursor, which is single-stranded, was purified by weak cation exchange chromatograph and preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), from which 73.39% of product was recovered at over 95% purity. The double-stranded protein (DesB30) was obtained by digesting the insulin precursor with trypsin. Using preparative RP-HPLC, the product was obtained with over 95% purity. Finally, the structure of DesB30 was confirmed.</p></details></div>

A C-terminally truncated E(rns) recombinant protein lacking the previously identified heparin-binding domain (HBD) bound to heparin column, suggesting the presence of another HBD in CSFV E(rns). Sequence analyses of the CSFV E(rns) coding region revealed a common potential N-terminal HBD at residues 301311. Site-directed mutagenesis of the basic amino acids at K(303) and K(306) significantly reduced the heparin-binding affinity of the protein. Further mutations of both T(310) and H(311) had little effect. Thus, a novel potential heparin-binding site near the N-terminus of CSFV strain TD96 E(rns) has been detected, and the two basic amino acids K(303) and K(306) are crucial for binding activity to heparin matrix and cell-surface GAGs.</p></details></div>

In the present study we present a series of experiments aiming to validate and apply an original high-tech implantable device, consisting of the coupling, for the first time, of an amperometric biosensor for brain ethanol detection, with a sensor for detecting the micro vibrations of the animal. This device allows the real-time comparison between the ethanol intake, its cerebral concentrations, and their effect on the motion when the animal is in the condition of voluntary drinking. To this end, we assessed in-vitro the efficiency of three different biosensor designs loading diverse alcohol oxidase enzymes (AOx) obtained from three different AOx-donor strains: Hansenula polymorpha, Candida boidinii and Pichia pastoris. In-vitro data disclosed that the devices loading Hansenula polymorpha and Candida boidinii were similarly efficient (respectively,</p><p><strong> LRS:</strong> 1.98+/-0.07 and 1.38+/-0.04 nA mM(-1)) but significantly less than the Pichia pastoris-loaded one (</p><p><strong>LRS:</strong> 7.57+/-0.12 nA mM(-1)). The in-vivo results indicate that this last biosensor design detected the rise of ethanol in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) after 15 minutes of voluntary 10% ethanol solution intake. At the same time, the micro-vibration sensor detected a significant increase in the rat's motion signal. Notably, both the biosensor and micro-vibration sensor described similar and parallel time-dependent U-shaped curves, thus providing a highly sensitive and time-locked high-resolution detection of the neurochemical and behavioural kinetics upon voluntary ethanol intake. The results overall indicate that such a dual telemetry unit represents a powerful device which, implanted in different brain areas, may boost further investigations on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie ethanol-induced motor activity and reward.</p></details></div>

On the other hand, collagen regions, widespread in vertebrate C1qDCs, are very uncommon in bivalves. In the present study, a C1qDC with a collagen-like domain (designated CgC1qDC-6) was identified from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and its possible involvement in immune responses was also characterized. The coding sequence of CgC1qDC-6 was of 756 bp, encoding a peptide of 251 amino acids with an N-terminal signal peptide, a central collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal ghC1q domain. CgC1qDC-6 was clustered with the C1qDCs from several mollusks in the phylogenetic tree. CgC1qDC-6 was detected at both mRNA and protein levels in all tested tissues including hepatopancreas, gonad, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, and hemocytes. The recombinant CgC1qDC-6 protein (rCgC1qDC-6) exhibited binding activity to various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including LPS, PGN, mannose and Poly</p><p><strong> I:</strong>C, and microorganisms including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Vibrio splendidus), Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), and fungus (Pichia pastoris). The phagocytic rates of oyster hemocytes towards V. splendidus pre-incubation with rCgC1qDC-6 were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05). In the chemotaxis assay, rCgC1qDC-6 could mediate the migration of oyster hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner, which exhibited a positive chemotactic effect at low concentration (< 10 nM). These results collectively indicated that CgC1qDC-6 could serve as a pattern recognition receptor and mediate the hemocyte phagocytosis and migration to eliminate the invading pathogens.</p></details></div>

Fungal defensin-like peptides (DLPs) are emerging as a potential source of new antibacterial drugs due to their potent antibacterial activity. In this study, nine novel fungal DLPs were firstly identified by querying against UniProt databases and expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their antibacterial and anti-biofilm ability were tested against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus. Results showed that among them, P2, the highest activity and expression level, showed low toxicity, no resistance, and high stability. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of P2 against Gram-positive bacteria were < 2 mug/mL. P2 exhibited the potent activity against intracellular MDR S. aureus (bacterial reduction in 80-97%) in RAW264.7 macrophages. P2 bound to/disrupted bacterial DNA, wrinkled outer membranes and permeabilized cytoplasmic membranes, but maintained the integrity of bacterial cells. P2 inhibited/eradicated the biofilm and killed 99% persister bacteria, which were resistant to 100x MIC vancomycin. P2 upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha/IL-1beta) and chemokine (MCP-1) levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages and in mice, respectively. Five milligram per kilogram P2 enhanced the survival of S. aureus-infected mice (100%), superior to vancomycin (30 mg/kg), inhibited the bacterial translocation, and alleviated multiple-organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney, and lung). These data suggest that P2 may be a candidate for novel antimicrobial agents against MDR staphylococcal infections.</p></details></div>

This trend is mostly met by the use of artificial non-nutritive sweeteners. However, these sweeteners have also been proven to have adverse health effects such as dizziness, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, and mood changes for aspartame. One of the solutions lies in the commercialization of sweet proteins, which are not associated with adverse health effects. Of these proteins, thaumatin is one of the most studied and most promising alternatives for sugars and artificial sweeteners. Since the natural production of these proteins is often too expensive, biochemical production methods are currently under investigation. With these methods, recombinant DNA technology is used for the production of sweet proteins in a host organism. The most promising host known today is the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. This yeast has a tightly regulated methanol-induced promotor, allowing a good control over the recombinant protein production. Great efforts have been undertaken for improving the yields and purities of thaumatin productions, but a further optimization is still desired. This review focuses on (i) the motivation for using and producing sweet proteins, (ii) the properties and history of thaumatin, (iii) the production of recombinant sweet proteins, and (iv) future possibilities for process optimization based on a systems biology approach.</p></details></div>

Rapid results, small-volume reactions, irrelevance of protein toxicity, flexibility, and openness of the system are strong points in favor of the cell-free system. However, the in vitro situation lacks the cellular quality control machinery comprising e.g., the translocon for inserting membrane proteins into lipid bilayers, and chaperon-assisted protein degradation pathways. Here, we compare yield and protein quality of the lactate transporter, PfFNT, from malaria parasites when produced in Pichia pastoris yeast, or in an Escherichia coli S30-extract-based cell-free system. Besides solubilization and correct folding, PfFNT requires oligomerization into homopentamers. We assessed PfFNT folding/oligomerization and function by transmission electron microscopy imaging, transport assays, and binding of small-molecule inhibitors. For the latter, we used chromatography of the PfFNT-inhibitor complex with dual-wavelength detection, and biolayer interferometry. Our data show, that PfFNT possesses an intrinsic capability for assuming the correct fold, oligomerization pattern, and functionality during in vitro translation. This competence depended on the detergent present in the cell-free reaction. The choice of detergent further affected purification and inhibitor binding. In conclusion, in the presence of a suitable detergent, cell-free systems are very well capable of producing high quality membrane proteins.</p></details></div>

Drugs are useful against hookworm infections, but hookworms rapidly reinfect people, and the parasites can develop drug resistance. Therefore, having a hookworm vaccine would be of tremendous benefit. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> We investigated the vaccine efficacy in outbred Syrian hamsters of three A. ceylanicum hookworm antigen candidates from two classes of proteins previously identified as promising vaccine candidates. These include two intestinally-enriched, putatively secreted cathepsin B cysteine proteases (AceyCP1, AceyCPL) and one small Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (AceySKPI3). Recombinant proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris, and adsorbed to Alhydrogel. Recombinant AceyCPL (rAceyCPL)/Alhydrogel and rAceySKPI3/Alhydrogel induced high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in 8/8 vaccinates, but were not protective. rAceyCP1/Alhydrogel induced intermediate serum IgG titers in ~60% of vaccinates in two different trials. rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had highly significantly decreased hookworm burdens, fecal egg counts and clinical pathology compared to Alhydrogel controls and nonresponders. Protection was highly correlated with rAceyCP1 serum IgG titer. Antisera from rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders, but not nonresponders or rAceyCPL/Alhydrogel vaccinates, significantly reduced adult A. ceylanicum motility in vitro. Furthermore, rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had canonical Th2-specific recall responses (IL4, IL5, IL13) in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> These findings indicate that rAceyCP1 is a promising vaccine candidate and validates a genomic/transcriptomic approach to human hookworm vaccine discovery.</p></details></div>

In yeasts, pexophagy depends mostly on the pexophagy receptors, such as Atg30 for Pichia pastoris and Atg36 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the autophagy scaffold proteins, Atg11 and Atg17, and the core autophagy machinery. In P. pastoris, the receptors for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) include the PTS1 receptor, Pex5, and the PTS2 receptor and co-receptor, Pex7 and Pex20, respectively. These shuttling receptors are predominantly cytosolic and only partially peroxisomal. It remains unresolved as to whether, when and how the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal receptors, as well as the peroxisomal matrix proteins, are degraded under pexophagy conditions. These cytosolic pools exist both in normal and mutant cells impaired in peroxisome biogenesis. We report here that Pex5 and Pex7, but not Pex20, are degraded by an Atg30-independent, selective autophagy pathway. To enter this selective autophagy pathway, Pex7 required its major PTS2 cargo, Pot1. Similarly, the degradation of Pex5 was inhibited in cells missing abundant PTS1 cargoes, such as alcohol oxidases and Fox2 (hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase). Furthermore, in cells deficient in PTS receptors, the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal matrix proteins, such as Pot1 and Fox2, were also removed by Atg30-independent, selective autophagy, under pexophagy conditions. In summary, the cytosolic pools of PTS receptors and their cargoes are degraded via a pexophagy-independent, selective autophagy pathway under pexophagy conditions. These autophagy pathways likely protect cells from futile enzymatic reactions that could potentially cause the accumulation of toxic cytosolic products.

Glucoamylases are usually thermostable and have peak activities at high temperature, as required for the industrial process of glucose production. In this study, a glucoamylase gene belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 15, Tlga15A, was cloned from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802, and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Recombinant glucoamylase TlGA showed optimal activities at pH 4.5 and 75 degrees C. The result of thermostability analysis showed that TlGA retained above 70% activity after incubating for 1 h at 65 degrees C, and 43% residual activity after 30 min at 70 degrees C. Moreover, TlGA had high resistance to most metal ions and chemical reagents tested. Various starch substrates could be hydrolyzed by TlGA, including soluble starch (255.6+/-15.3) U/mg, amylopectin (342.3+/-24.7) U/mg, glycogen (185.4+/-12.5) U/mg, dextrin (423.3+/-29.3) U/mg and pullulan (65.7+/-8.1) U/mg. The primary, secondary and tertiary structures of glucoamylase were further analyzed. The low ratio of Gly in the primary structure and low exposed nonpolarity solvent accessible surface in the tertiary structure may be the main reasons for TlGA's thermostability. These results show that TlGA is great promising for potential use in the commercial production of glucose syrups.

Two laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes were identified in the genome of M. importuna SCYDJ1-A1 as putative laccase-encoding genes. The two genes, belonging to Auxiliary Activity family 1 subfamily 3, were named as MiLacA and MiLacB. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences showed that MiLacA is closest to a LMCO of M. importuna 22J1, while MiLacB had low similarity with known Morchella LMCOs. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that MiLacA was expressed at much higher levels than MiLacB throughout the entire course of artificial cultivation. MiLacA was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris as a recombinant protein. Biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme showed that MiLacA simultaneously possessed laccase and polyphenol-oxidase activities. MiLacA could be strongly inhibited by Fe(2+), which is unusual. The optimum pH was four and optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. The enzyme retained over 74% of the laccase activity after 16-h incubation at 60 degrees C, which means that its thermostability is at the forefront among the currently known laccases. Our findings may help to elucidate how the laccase of M. importuna is involved in decaying lignin in plant litter, and could also provide a candidate thermostable laccase for potential industrial application.</p></details></div>

Herein, two distinct A2M genes (designated as PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2, respectively) were isolated from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 encoded proteins with 1541 or 1516 amino acids, respectively, containing the typically functional domains of A2M. Unlike highly expressed in hemocytes of most arthropods, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 were predominantly detected in gill, eyestalk and digestive tracks. During the embryonic stages, PtA2Ms were found to be expressed most highly in fertilized eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. After challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcripts of PtA2Ms showed similar time-dependent response expression pattern, while PtA2M-1 was more sensitive to Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris infection than PtA2M-2. Knockdown of PtA2M-1 or PtA2M-2 could significantly enhance the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and serine protease related genes (PtcSP1-3 and PtSPH), however, PtLSZ and the phagocytosis-related genes (PtMyosin and PtRab5) were effectively inhibited. These results were further supported by the PO and lysozyme activities in hemolymph of the PtA2M-1- or PtA2M-2-silenced crabs. In addition, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 could regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (PtALF1-3, PtCrustin1 and PtCrustin3) through the Toll and NF-kappaB pathways. Our findings together suggest that PtA2Ms might function in crab host defense via regulating the proPO system, phagocytosis and the expression of AMP genes.</p></details></div>

This study focused on identifying the removal of two widely used pesticides, isoproturon (IPU) and acetochlor (ACT), by a genetically developed paddy (or rice) plant overexpressing an uncharacterized glycosyltransferase (IRGT1). IRGT1 conferred plant resistance to isoproturon-acetochlor, which was manifested by attenuated cellular injury and alleviated toxicity of rice under isoproturon-acetochlor stress. A short-term study showed that IRGT1-transformed lines removed 33.3-48.3% of isoproturon and 39.8-53.5% of acetochlor from the growth medium, with only 59.5-72.1 and 58.9-70.4% of the isoproturon and acetochlor remaining in the plants compared with the levels in untransformed rice. This phenotype was confirmed by IRGT1-expression in yeast ( Pichia pastoris) which grew better and contained less isoproturon-acetochlor than the control cells. A long-term study showed that isoproturon-acetochlor concentrations at all developmental stages were significantly lower in the transformed rice, which contain only 59.3-69.2% (isoproturon) and 51.7-57.4% (acetochlor) of the levels in wild type. In contrast, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that more isoproturon-acetochlor metabolites were detected in the transformed rice. Sixteen metabolites of isoproturon and 19 metabolites of acetochlor were characterized in rice for Phase I reactions, and 9 isoproturon and 13 acetochlor conjugates were characterized for Phase II reactions in rice; of these, 7 isoproturon and 6 acetochlor metabolites and conjugates were reported in plants for the first time.</p></details></div>

Exploration of alternatives production systems like as extracellular expression in microorganisms generally recognized as safe (such as Pichia pastoris Glycoswitch((R))) could be advantageous, in particular, if this system is able to produce homogeneous glycosylation. Here, we evaluated extracellular expression into Glycoswitch((R)) using two different strains constructions containing the asnB gene coding for Erwinia chrysanthemi L-ASNase (with and without His-tag), in order to find the best system for producing the extracellular and biologically active protein. When the His-tag was absent, both cell expression and protein secretion processes were considerably improved. Three-dimensional modeling of the protein suggests that additional structures (His-tag) could adversely affect native conformation and folding from L-ASNase and therefore the expression and cell secretion of this enzyme.</p></details></div>

The phospholipase D-mediated green synthesis of phosphatidylserine has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In this study, the phospholipase D was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. The highest activity of phospholipase D was observed in C. glutamicum, which was 0.25 U/mL higher than these in B. subtilis (0.14 U/mL) and P. pastoris (0.22 U/mL). System engineering of three potential factors, including (1) signal peptides, (2) ribosome binding site, and (3) promoters, was attempted to improve the expression level of phospholipase D in C. glutamicum. The maximum phospholipase D activity reached 1.9 U/mL, which was 7.6-fold higher than that of the initial level. The enzyme displayed favorable transphosphatidylation activity and it could efficiently catalyze the substrates L-serine and soybean lecithin for synthesis of phosphatidylserine after optimizing the conversion reactions in detail. Under the optimum conditions (trichloromethane/enzyme solution 4:2, 8 mg/mL soybean lecithin, 40 mg/mL L-serine, and 15 mM CaCl2, with shaking under 40 degrees C for 10 h), the reaction process showed 48.6% of conversion rate and 1.94 g/L of accumulated phosphatidylserine concentration.

The results showed that EG27II has a double-psi six-stranded beta-barrel and that the structure of EG27II more closely resembles those of subfamily C enzymes than those of subfamily A enzymes. The structure of EG27II complexed with cellobiose was also determined under cryoconditions and at room temperature at three pH values, pH 4.0, 5.5 and 8.0, and no structural changes were found to be associated with the change in pH. The structural comparison and catalytic activity measurements showed that Asp137 and Asn112 function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively, and that Asp27 is also an important residue for catalysis.

Thus, they can act on water-insoluble carboxylic esters releasing long-chain fatty acids but also on sterol esters, although with different activity and affinity. The differences in the catalytic properties among the proteins of this family are explained by small changes in the hydrophobicity of some regions. One of such versatile enzymes is the sterol esterase/lipase from Ophiostoma piceae (OPE) that acts very efficiently on the two types of substrates. Structurally, OPE is characterized by the presence of a lid formed by a alpha-helix and two 310-helices rich in hydrophobic amino acids. In this study, the ope gene was modified by directed mutagenesis in order to change specific amino acids in the lid region to modify its structure with the aim of increasing its hydrophobicity. Several recombinant forms of OPE were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. In silico molecular dynamics simulations have been used to decipher the mechanistic principles behind the improvements in substrate catalysis. The analyses suggested that the enhanced activity toward hydrophobic substrates such as triglycerides could be due to a better stabilization of the substrate in the lid region as a result of an increased hydrophobicity and an improved topology. These results indicate that in silico simulations can be useful for the optimization of the activity of lipases from the C. rugose-like family for different biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

In this study, the first GH family 27 alpha-galactosidase gene from Irpex lacteus was cloned. The gene had an open reading frame of 1314bp interrupted by 12 introns. The recombinant alpha-galactosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris (rILgalA) had an apparent molecular mass of 64kDa and was highly N-glycosylated. rILgalA was maximally active at pH4.8 and 70 degrees C. It was stable over a broad pH range of 3-11, retained 90% of its activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 10h and exhibited strong resistance to digestive proteases. Unlike many other alpha-galactosidases, rILgalA was hyperactive on RFOs. Its specific activities toward melibiose, raffinose and stachyose were 644, 755 and 833Umg(-1), respectively. The corresponding Kcat/Km values were 120, 130 and 180mM(-1)s(-1), which were the highest among reported alpha-galactosidases. rILgalA almost completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose in soymilk at 60 degrees C in 30min.

In mammals, p40 can be secreted as a monomer or homodimer and acts independently to mediate cellular responses. Recently, three p40 paralogues were isolated and identified from grass carp and other fish species, but whether they exist independently as well as their functional consequences and significance remain unclear. In the present study, using grass carp as the model, we for the first time demonstrated the existence of natural fish p40a, p40b and p40c (gcp40a, gcp40b and gcp40c) mainly as a monomer in culture supernatant of head kidney leukocytes (HKLs). Particularly, their excessive secretion induced by various immune stimuli suggests possible involvement of free p40s in fish immune responses. To define their functions, recombinant grass carp p40a/b/c (rgcp40a, rgcp40b and rgcp40c) were prepared by Pichia pastoris expression system, and they possessed the activities to enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) in grass carp HKLs. These pro-inflammatory properties of p40 isoforms prompted us to investigate their roles during the inflammatory process. In line with this, in vivo study revealed the pathogenic effect of rgcp40a on intestinal inflammation, whereas gcp40a polyclonal antibodies remarkably ameliorated Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal histopathological changes. Taken together, our results uncover the biological significance of free p40s in teleost, and provide new clue for targeting fish intestinal inflammation.</p></details></div>

The complete cDNA of PtMBL gene was 1208 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 732 bp that encoded 244 amino acid proteins. PtMBL shared lower amino acid similarity with other MBLs, yet it contained the conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with QPD motif and was clearly member of the collectin family. PtMBL transcripts were mainly detected in eyestalk and gill with sexually dimorphic expression. The temporal expression of PtMBL in hemocytes showed different activation times after challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The recombinant PtMBL protein revealed antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It could also bind and agglutinate (Ca(2+)-dependent) both bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, the agglutinating activity could be inhibited by both d-galactose and d-mannose, suggesting the broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition spectrum of PtMBL.

Fusion protein was optimized in terms of best expression condition and fibrinolytic activity and compared with the rSAK. Expression level of the designed construct reached up to 175 mg/L of the culture medium after 72-hr stimulation with 2.5% methanol and remained steady for 3-4 days. The highest expression was obtained at the range of 2-3% methanol. The SAK-2RGD-TT (relative activity >82%) was more active at 25-37 degrees C than rSAK (relative activity of 93%). Further, it showed relative activity >80% at pH ranges of 7-9. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 27 and 24 kDa at ratio of 5 to 3, respectively. The specific fibrinolytic activity of the SAK-2RGD-TTI was measured as 8,269 U/mg, and 19,616 U/mg for the nonpurified and purified proteins, respectively. Deglycosylation by using tunicamycin in culture medium resulted in higher fibrinolytic activity of SAK-2RGD-TTI (2.2 fold). Consequently, compared to the rSAK, at the same equimolar proportion, addition of RGD and TTI fragments could increase fibrinolytic activity. Also, P. pastoris can be considered as an efficient host for overexpression of the soluble SAK-2RGD-TTI with high activity without requiring a complicated purification procedure.</p></details></div>

Moreover, we propose a quality control protocol based on (1) a metabolite containing selenium to assess the instrument performance and on (2) in vivo synthesized isotopically enriched Pichia pastoris to validate the accuracy of carbon isotopologue distributions (CIDs), in this case considering each isotopologue of a targeted metabolite panel. Finally, validation involved a thorough assessment of procedural blanks and matrix interferences. We compared the analytical figures of merit regarding CID determination for over 40 metabolites between the three methods. Excellent precisions of less than 1% and trueness bias as small as 0.01-1% were found for the majority of compounds, whereas the CID determination of a small fraction was affected by contaminants.

Far UV CD structure analysis revealed major beta-sheet and minor alpha helical segments present in the Lcc1. A significant change in the spectrum of Lcc1, indicative of unfolding of secondary structures, was observed with increasing concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) during Trp fluorescence, absorption and CD measurements. A similar trend was also noticed for enzyme activity with respect to GdnHCl concentrations. To establish the role of copper ion in the catalytic activity of laccase, a complete removal of copper was carried out and addition of copper was found to restore the structure and activity during the refolding process. The apo form was also reconstituted by addition of zinc ion which restored nearly 84% of enzyme activity, indicating non-essential role of copper in maintaining conformation and activity. Structural studies and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry data supported these observations.</p></details></div>

Here, recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLf) expressed in Pichia pastoris was tested for its potential cytotoxic activity on a panel of six human breast cancer cell lines. The rhLf cytotoxic effect was determined via a live-cell HTS imaging assay. Also, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry protocols were employed to investigate the rhLf mode of action. The rhLf revealed an effective CC50 of 91.4 and 109.46 microg/ml on non-metastatic and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, with favorable selective cytotoxicity index values, 11.68 and 13.99, respectively. Moreover, rhLf displayed satisfactory SCI values on four additional cell lines, MDA-MB-468, HCC70, MCF-7 and T-47D (1.55-3.34). Also, rhLf provoked plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage in MDA-MB-231 cells, being all three apoptosis-related morphological changes. Also, rhLf was able to shrink the microfilaments, forming a punctuated cytoplasmic pattern in both the MDA-MB-231 and Hs-27 cells, as visualized in confocal photomicrographs. Moreover, performing flow cytometric analysis, rhLf provoked significant phosphatidylserine externalization, cell cycle arrest in the S phase and apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Hence, rhLf possesses selective cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells. Also, rhLf caused apoptosis-associated morphologic changes, disruption of F-actin cytoskeleton organization, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and arrest of the cell cycle progression on triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall results suggest that rhLf is using the apoptosis pathway as its mechanism to inflict cell death.

This nontraditional substrate can be widely produced from syngas via hydrolysis or pyrolysis of the cellulosic biomass, chemical or microbial catalysis, anaerobic fermentation in treated wastewater, etc. However, the toxicity of acetate to microorganisms has held back its utilization, especially for the eukaryotes that are good hosts for production of complicated pharmaceuticals or chemicals. This study seeks to improve acetate utilization in a widely used yeast host, Komagataella phaffii (previously Pichia pastoris), by metabolic engineering of acetate tolerance, transport, and metabolism. Results: A kinase-deficient library of K. phaffii was firstly used to screen acetate-resistant kinases. The HRK1 knockout strain was sensitive to acetate and overexpression of this gene improved acetate tolerance and cell growth of the strain. Also, overexpression of HRK1 caused a 55% productivity improvement of acetyl-CoA-dependent 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA). However, activation of Hrk1 on membrane H(+)-ATPase Pma1 seemed not to work in the engineered strain. Acetate transporter gene ScFPS1* was further overexpressed, despite of not improving 6-MSA biosynthesis. To enhance acetate metabolism, acetyl-CoA synthesizing related genes, yeast PpACS1, ScACS1*, and E. coli ackA/pta were overexpressed separately. Introduction of PpACS1 and ScACS1* each increased biosynthesis of 6-MSA by approximately 20% on 20 mM acetate. Finally, co-overexpression of HRK1 and ScACS1* improved 6-MSA productivity by 51% on 20 mM acetate, despite that a low expression level of HRK1 happened when genes were expressed under the same promoter. Conclusions: HRK1 screened by K. phaffii kinase-deficient library played an important role in acetate tolerance and was proved to profit the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. It could be a potential target for metabolic engineering of acetate utilization in other eukaryotic hosts as well. A combined strategy of introducing genes for acetate tolerance and metabolism further improved biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA derived reporter compound in K. phaffii. This makes it a good choice for acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals with acetate as substrate or precursor in K. phaffii, which would also extend the use of this chassis host.</p></details></div>

However, practical implementation of hydrophobins at large scale has been hindered by low recombinant yields. In this study, the effects of increasing hydrophobin gene copy number and overexpressing endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone proteins Kar2p, Pdi1p, and Ero1p were explored as a means to enhance recombinant yields of the class II hydrophobin HFBI in the eukaryotic expression host Pichia pastoris. One-, 2-, and 3-copy-HFBI strains were attained using an in vitro multimer ligation approach, with strains displaying copy number stability following subsequent transformations as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Increasing HFBI copy number alone had no effect on increasing HFBI secretion, but increasing copy number in concert with chaperone overexpression synergistically increased HFBI secretion. Overexpression of PDI1 or ERO1 caused insignificant changes in HFBI secretion in 1- and 2-copy strains, but a statistically significant HFBI secretion increase in 3-copy strain. KAR2 overexpression consistently resulted in enhanced HFBI secretion in all copy number strains, with 3-copy-HFBI secreting 22+/-1.6 fold more than the 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. The highest increase was seen in 3-copy-HFBI/Ero1p overexpressing strain with 30+/-4.0 fold increase in HFBI secretion over 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. This corresponded to an expression level of approximately 330 mg/L HFBI in the 5 ml small-scale format used in this study.</p></details></div>

In this study, volumetric mass transfer (kLa) and volumetric gassed power input (Pg/V) were evaluated within values attainable in large-scale production as scale-up criteria for recombinant dextranase production by Mut(S) P. pastoris strain. Cultures were oxygen limited when the volumetric gassed power supply was limited to 2 kW m(-3). Specific growth rate, and then dextranase production, increased as kLa and Pg/V did. Meanwhile, specific production and methanol consumption rates were constant, due to the limited methanol condition also achieved at 2 L bioprocesses. The specific dextranase production rate was two times higher than the values previously reported for a Mut(+) strain. After a scale-up process, at constant kLa, the specific growth rate was kept at 30 L bioprocess, whereas dextranase production decreased, due to the effect of methanol accumulation. Results obtained at 30 L bioprocesses suggest that even under oxygen-limited conditions, methanol saturated conditions are not adequate to express dextranase with the promoter alcohol oxidase. Bioprocesses developed within feasible and scalable operational conditions are of high interest for the commercial production of recombinant proteins from Pichia pastoris.</p></details></div>

Efficient enzymatic systems are needed to degrade the plant cell wall and overcome its recalcitrance. A widely used producer of cellulolytic cocktails is the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei, but this organism secretes a limited set of enzymes. To improve the saccharification yields, one strategy is to upgrade the T. reesei enzyme cocktail with enzymes produced by other biomass-degrading filamentous fungi isolated from biodiversity. Results: In this study, the enzymatic cocktails secreted by five strains from the genus Aspergillus (Aspergillus japonicus strains BRFM 405, 1487, 1489, 1490 and Aspergillus niger strain BRFM 430) were tested for their ability to boost a T. reesei reference cocktail for the saccharification of pretreated biomass. Proteomic analysis of fungal secretomes that significantly improved biomass degradation showed that the presence of proteins belonging to a putative LPMO family previously identified by genome analysis and awaiting experimental demonstration of activity. Members of this novel LPMO family, named AA16, are encountered in fungi and oomycetes with life styles oriented toward interactions with plant biomass. One AA16 protein from Aspergillus aculeatus (AaAA16) was produced to high level in Pichia pastoris. LPMO-type enzyme activity was demonstrated on cellulose with oxidative cleavage at the C1 position of the glucose unit. AaAA16 LPMO was found to significantly improve the activity of T. reesei CBHI on cellulosic substrates. Conclusions: Although Aspergillus spp. has been investigated for decades for their CAZymes diversity, we identified members of a new fungal LPMO family using secretomics and functional assays. Properties of the founding member of the AA16 family characterized herein could be of interest for use in biorefineries.</p></details></div>

MSTN inhibition by myostatin propeptide (MSPP) increased skeletal muscle mass, myofiber growth and muscle force. Thus, this study was designed to produce wild-type porcine MSPP (WT-MSPP) and its mutated form (D75A-MSPP) in yeast Pichia pastoris and to investigate its potential enhancement of myoblast growth and differentiation. In an in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP (10mug/mL) in either a regular culture medium or in a differentiation medium for 72h. In an animal trial, post-weaning C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were administered WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP for 6weeks. The results showed that C2C12 myoblasts treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP could dramatically promote cell proliferation. Both myoD and myogenin were significantly increased (p<.05) after WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP treatment. D75A-MSPP was particularly more effective than WT-MSPP in promoting myotube formation (p<.05). The post-weaning mice treated with D75A-MSPP significantly increased both body and muscle weights compared with the mock and WT-MSPP groups (p<.05). Furthermore, the mice treatment with D75A-MSPP could prevent increased glucose injection from inducing glucose elevation. Our data indicated that a mutant-type MSPP (D75A-MSPP) was superior to WT-MSPP in effectively enhancing myofiber growth due to the highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage by the bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid (BMP-1/TLD) and thus has potential applications for clinical muscle wasting diseases or for increasing muscle mass in meat-producing animals.</p></details></div>

The beta-galactosidases from bacteria, especially lactobacilli, and yeast have neutral pH and are much more likely to be developed as food additives. However, the challenges of cumbersome purification, product toxicity, and low yield in protein production have limited the commercialization of many excellent candidates. In this study, we identified a beta-galactosidase gene (bg42-106) in Bifidobacterium animalis ACCC05790 and expressed the gene product in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris GS115, respectively. The recombinant bG42-106 purified from E. coli cells was found to be optimally active at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C and had excellent stability over a wide pH range (5.0-8.0) and at high temperature (60 degrees C). The specific activity of bG42-106 reached up to 2351 U/mg under optimal conditions. The galacto-oligosaccharide yield was 24.45 g/L after incubation with bG42-106 at 60 degrees C for 2 h. When recombinant bG42-106 was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, it was found in the culture medium but only at a concentration of 1.73 U/ml. To increase its production, three strategies were employed, including codon optimization, disulfide formation, and fusion with a Cherry tag, with Cherry-tag fusion being most effective. The culture medium of P. pastoris that expressed Cherry-tagged bG42-106 contained 24.4 U/mL of beta-galactosidase activity, which is 14-fold greater than that produced by culture of P. pastoris harboring wild-type bG42-106.</p></details></div>

The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-beta-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs and similarly to expansins, FgCPPs are trapped by cellulose and not by chitin, thus suggesting that these proteins interact with cellulose. A double knock-out mutant deleted of both FgCPPs encoding genes produces much more cellulase activity than the corresponding wild type strain when grown on CMC, likely compensating the absence of FgCPPs. This result prompted us to investigate a possible synergistic effect of these proteins with fungal cellulases. The incubation of FgCPPs in the presence of a fungal cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) determines an increased enzymatic activity on CMC, filter paper and wheat cell walls. The observation that FgCPPs act with a non-hydrolytic mechanism indicates that these proteins favor fungal cellulase activity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections.</p></details></div>

However, pIFN-gamma is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-gamma in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-gamma protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-gamma protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-gamma gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-gamma gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-gamma gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-gamma protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0-24 h at 28 degrees C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24-72 h at 25 degrees C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO.

Methanol induction however poses several drawbacks. One approach to improve processes is to use MutS strains with reduced methanol catabolic ability. Various reports claim that MutS allows higher recombinant protein production levels than Mut+, but scarcely elaborate on reasons for differences. In this study, EGFP was used as a PAOX1 -driven reporter for the investigation of expression differences between Mut+ and MutS strains. Mut+ exhibited higher responses to methanol, with faster growth (0.07 vs 0.01 h(-1) ) and higher consumption of methanol (2.25 vs 1.81 mmol.(gDCW .h)(-1) ) and oxygen (2.2 vs 0.66 mmol.(gDCW .h)(-1) ) than MutS. Mut+ yielded more biomass than MutS (2.3 vs 1.3 gDCW .L(-1) ), and carbon dioxide analysis of bioreactor off-gas suggested that considerable amounts of methanol were consumed by Mut+ via the dissimilatory pathway. In contrast, it was demonstrated that the MutS population switched to an induced state more rapidly than Mut+. In addition, MutS exhibited 3.4-fold higher fluorescence levels per cell, (77 509 vs 23 783 SFU), indicative of higher recombinant protein production. The findings were verified by similar results obtained during the expression of a lipase. Based on differences in response to methanol versus recombinant protein production, it was proposed that higher energy availability occurs in MutS for recombinant protein synthesis, contrary to Mut+ that uses the energy to maintain high levels of methanol catabolic pathways and biomass production.</p></details></div>

Here, we show that an evolutionary transition from covalent conjugation to non-covalent interaction has occurred in the ubiquitin-like autophagy-related 12 (ATG12) conjugation system. ATG12 is covalently conjugated to its sole substrate, ATG5, by a ubiquitylation-like mechanism. However, the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium and Toxoplasma and some yeast species such as Komagataella phaffii (previously Pichia pastoris) lack the E2-like enzyme ATG10 and the most carboxy (C)-terminal glycine of ATG12, both of which are required for covalent linkage. Instead, ATG12 in these organisms forms a non-covalent complex with ATG5. This non-covalent ATG12-ATG5 complex retains the ability to facilitate ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation. These results suggest that ubiquitin-like covalent conjugation can evolve to a simpler non-covalent interaction, most probably when the system has a limited number of targets.</p></details></div>

To obtain enzymes with enhanced catalytic efficiency (pH5.5) and excellent activity in acidic pH range, we performed structure-based rational design of a thermostable phytase (PhyAn). For this, six mutants based on different rational design strategies were constructed and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Particularly, the extracellular enzymatic activity was assessed to ensure that the produced enzymes met requirements of further analyses. Several positive mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency or pH-profile shifts were carefully examined. Biochemical and kinetic investigations of purified mutants revealed that E79K, E80K, E79K+E80K and D68K had higher catalytic efficiency than the parent enzyme by approximately 49%, 67%, 86% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, the optimum pH of mutant Y65H was shifted from 5.0 to 3.0, and the peak of D68K shifted to pH5.5. Analysis of the structural-functional relationships revealed that changes in amino acid charges, structural flexibility and space hindrance could significantly influence certain enzyme characteristics. Our results illustrate the feasibility and present a structural foundation for enhancing the phytase-catalytic efficiency and acid resistance by assembling mutations derived using rational design.</p></details></div>

Results showed that the E. coli-derived recombinant Hispidalin did not show any antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains, whereas the P. pastoris-derived recombinant Hispidalin (rHispidalin) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against five pathogenic bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. rHispidalin also has bactericidal activity and completely killed all of the Staphylococcus aureus within 40min. Additionally, rHispidalin showed a broad range of thermostability and pH stability, and a hemolytic activity of less than 2% even at a concentration of 300mug/ml; it was resistant to trypsin and proteinase K, but was moderately sensitive to pepsin and papain. Moreover, rHispidalin effectively permeabilized the cytoplasmic membrane and disrupted the morphology of targeted bacterial cells. After an initial optimization was performed, the amount of rHispidalin accumulation could reach as high as 98.6mug/ml.

These are proteins, typically with repetitive amino acid sequences, that have such physical properties that they can be used as functional materials. Well-known natural examples are collagen, silk, and elastin, but also artificial sequences have been devised. These proteins can be produced in a suitable host via recombinant DNA technology, and it is this inherent control over monomer sequence and molecular size that renders this class of polymers of particular interest to the fields of nanomaterials and biomedical research. Traditionally, Escherichia coli has been the main workhorse for the production of these polymers, but the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is finding increased use in view of the often high yields and potential bioprocessing benefits. We here provide an overview of protein-based polymers produced in P. pastoris. We summarize their physicochemical properties, briefly note possible applications, and detail their biosynthesis. Some challenges that may be faced when using P. pastoris for polymer production are identified: (i) low yields and poor process control in shake flask cultures; i.e., the need for bioreactors, (ii) proteolytic degradation, and (iii) self-assembly in vivo. Strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed, which we anticipate will be of interest also to readers involved in protein expression in P. pastoris in general.</p></details></div>

ChSase AC II, with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa and a specific activity of 18.7 U/mg, showed the highest activity at 37 degrees C and pH 6.5 and maintained stability at a broad range of pH (5(-)7.5) and temperature (below 35 degrees C).

In this research, FOS produced by BfrA were characterized by HPAE-PAD analysis as a mixture of 1-kestotriose, 6(G)-kestotriose (neokestose), and to a major extent 6-kestotriose. In order to increase the FOS yield, three BfrA mutants (W14Y, W14Y-N16S and W14Y-W256Y), designed from sequence divergence between hydrolases and transferases, were constructed and constitutively expressed in the non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant glycoproteins were purified and characterized. The three mutants synthesized 6-kestotriose as the major component of a FOS mixture that includes minor amounts of tetra- and pentasaccharides. In all cases, sucrose hydrolysis was the predominant reaction. All mutants reached a similar overall FOS yield, with the average value 37.6% (w/w) being 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (12.6%, w/w).

Due solely to their presence in the Wsc-family proteins working as a plasma membrane sensor for surface stress and in a fungal beta-1,3-exoglucanse, WSC domains have been presumed to possess carbohydrate-binding property without any experimental evidence. Aiming at elucidation of function(s) of WSC domains, we characterized a WSC domain-containing alcohol oxidase from the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (PoAlcOX). Recombinant PoAlcOX produced with Pichia pastoris showed alcohol oxidase activity toward a wide range of substrates including two aliphatic alcohols, a branched-chain alcohol, a diol, and a polyol. Deletion of the WSC domain virtually unaffected oxidation of these substrates by PoAlcOX, indicating that the domain makes no contribution to the catalytic activity. In analogy to some carbohydrate-binding modules, we inferred that the WSC domain plays a role in protein anchoring, and evaluated binding capability of PoAlcOX to a set of polysaccharide components of fungal and plant cell walls. This revealed that PoAlcOX binds to xylans and fungal chitin/beta-1,3-glucan in the WSC domain-dependent manner, demonstrating for the first time the carbohydrate-binding property of the domain. Additionally, we provide evidence that PoAlcOX immobilized on birch wood xylan retains the catalytic activity. Overall, the data we collected suggest that the role of the WSC domain of PoAlcOX is not recognition of substrates but attaching the enzyme to plant and/or fungal cell wall.</p></details></div>

In this sense, nonpungent capsaicin analogues as olvanil are a feasible alternative to the unpleasant sensations produced by capsaicin while maintaining a similar pharmacological profile. Olvanil can be obtained by a lipase-catalyzed chemoenzymatic process. In the present work, recombinant Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and subsequently immobilized by cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) methodology for the synthesis of olvanil. The CALB-CLEAs were obtained directly from the fermentation broth of P. pastoris without any purification step in order to assess the role of the contaminant proteins of the crude extract as co-feeders. The CALB-CLEAs were also bioimprinted to enhance the catalytic performance in olvanil synthesis. When CALB was precipitated with isopropanol, the obtained CALB-CLEAs exhibited the highest activity in the synthesis of olvanil, regardless of the glutaraldehyde concentration. The maximum product synthesis was found at 72 hr obtaining 6.8 g L(-1) of olvanil with a reaction yield of 16%. When CALB was bioimprinted with olvanil, the synthesis was enhanced 1.3 times, reaching 10.7 g L(-1) of olvanil at 72 hr of reaction with a reaction yield of 25%. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated different morphologies of the CLEAs depending on the precipitating agent and the template used for bioimprinting. Recombinant CALB-CLEAs obtained directly from the fermentation broth are a suitable alternative to commercial enzymatic preparations for the synthesis of olvanil in organic medium.</p></details></div>

However, obtaining sufficient amounts of millipedes is difficult, and the production of the Chamberlinius hualienensis HNL (ChuaHNL) in E. coli has not been very successful. Therefore, we investigated the conditions required for high-yield heterologous production of this enzyme using Pichia pastoris. When we employed P. pastoris to express His-ChuaHNL, the yield was very low (22.6 +/- 3.8 U/L culture). Hence, we investigated the effects of ChuaHNL codon optimization and the co-production of two protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) [from P. pastoris (PpPDI) and C. hualienensis (ChuaPDI1, ChuaPDI2)] on His-ChuaHNL production. The productivity of His-ChuaHNL was increased approximately 140 times per unit culture to 3170 +/- 144.7 U/L by the co-expression of codon-optimized ChuaHNL and PpPDI. Moreover, we revealed that the N-glycosylation on ChuaHNL had a large effect on the stability, enzyme secretion, and catalytic properties of ChuaHNL in P. pastoris. This study demonstrates an economical and efficient approach for the production of HNL, and the data show that glycosylation has a large effect on the enzyme properties and the P. pastoris expression system.</p></details></div>

Due to the high rate of protein production, incorrectly folded proteins may accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To restore their proper folding, the cell triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR); however, if the proteins cannot be repaired, they are degraded, which impairs process productivity. Moreover, a non-producing/non-secreting subpopulation of cells might occur, which also decreases overall productivity. Therefore, an in depth understanding of intracellular protein fluxes and population heterogeneity is needed to improve productivity. Under industrially relevant cultivation conditions in bioreactors, we cultured P. pastoris strains producing three different recombinant proteins: penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli (EcPGA), lipase B from Candida antarctica (CaLB) and xylanase A from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TlXynA). Extracellular and intracellular product concentrations were determined, along with flow cytometry-based single-cell measurements of cell viability and the up-regulation of UPR. The cell population was distributed into four clusters, two of which were viable cells with no UPR up-regulation, differing in cell size and complexity. The other two clusters were cells with impaired viability, and cells with up-regulated UPR. Over the time course of cultivation, the distribution of the population into these four clusters changed. After 30 h of production, 60% of the cells producing EcPGA, which accumulated in the cells (50-70% of the product), had up-regulated UPR, but only 13% of the cells had impaired viability. A higher proportion of cells with decreased viability was observed in strains producing CaLB (20%) and TlXynA (27%). The proportion of cells with up-regulated UPR in CaLB-producing (35%) and TlXynA-producing (30%) strains was lower in comparison to the EcPGA-producing strain, and a smaller proportion of CaLB and TlXynA (<10%) accumulated in the cells. These data provide an insight into the development of heterogeneity in a recombinant P. pastoris population during a biotechnological process. A deeper understanding of the relationship between protein production/secretion and the regulation of the UPR might be utilized in bioprocess control and optimization with respect to secretion and population heterogeneity.</p></details></div>

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of expressing PLD from Streptomyces halstedii in different hosts. The enzymatic activity of PLD reached 69.12 U/mL in the homologous Streptomyces lividans host, which was around 50-fold higher than that in the original host. Meanwhile, in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, PLD expression was poor and showed obvious toxicity to cells, which may have been one of the reasons for low levels of PLD observed in heterologous hosts. An induced (Ptip)/constitutive (PermE*) dual-promoter expression system in S. lividans was constructed, which could achieve constitutive expression with PLD enzymatic activity of 13.41 U/mL under non-induced conditions and yield the highest PLD enzymatic activity of 68.33 U/mL with 2 mug/mL thiostreptone.

They have been demonstrated to able to C6-oxidize cellulose to produce C6-hexodialdoses. However, the biological function of C6 oxidation of PMOs remains unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether C6-hexodialdoses can be further oxidized to uronic acid (glucuronic acid-containing oligosaccharides). Results: A PMO gene, Hipmo1, was isolated from Humicola insolens and expressed in Pichia pastoris. This PMO (HiPMO1), belonging to the auxiliary activity 9 (AA9) family, was shown to able to cleave cellulose to yield non-oxidized and oxidized cello-oligosaccharides. The enzyme oxidizes C6 positions in cellulose to form glucuronic acid-containing cello-oligosaccharides, followed by hydrolysis with beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase to yield glucose, glucuronic acid, and saccharic acid. This indicates that HiPMO1 can catalyze C6 oxidation of hydroxyl groups of cellulose to carboxylic groups. Conclusions: HiPMO1 oxidizes C6 of cellulose to form glucuronic acid-containing cello-oligosaccharides followed by hydrolysis with beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase to yield glucose, glucuronic acid, and saccharic acid, and even possibly by beta-eliminative cleavage to produce unsaturated cello-oligosaccharides.

In this study, an ordered biotransformation method was proposed employing Arthrobacter simplex and recombinant Pichia pastoris with 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce BD from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (AD) efficiently. To lower the oxidation towards BD in A. simplex, the transformation was conducted sequentially by C1,2 dehydrogenation in A. simplex and 17beta-carbonyl reduction in recombinant P. pastoris GS115. Moreover, the reaction system was inactivated before recombinant P. pastoris GS115 was added to further inhibit the oxidation of BD by A. simplex, and the productivity of BD was improved 10.6% compared with the control. Furthermore, by optimizing the conditions of transformation from AD to BD, 4.2 g/L BD was generated with 83% productivity from 5.0 g/L AD, which was the highest productivity reported by biological method. This study offers a promising method to produce BD by ordered biotransformation system, which can also be used to manufacture other steroidal compounds that are difficult to acquire directly.</p></details></div>

Methods: An attempt was made to produce a fusion protein (P-TUFT-ALT-2) of abundant larval transcript protein-2 and Tuftsin to enhance its immunogenicity. The fusion construct was expressed in Pichia pastoris, a nonexpensive commercial expression system. This study focused on the evaluation of immunological response produced by P-TUFT-ALT-2 in Balb/c mice. Result and discussion: P-TUFT-ALT-2 showed an enhanced IgG peak titre compared to E. coli expressed E-ALT-2 and P. pastoris expressed P-ALT-2. IgG2b, IgG2a and IgG1 production were predominant indicating a balanced Th1/Th2 response. P-TUFT-ALT-2 also induced about 28% and 9.5% higher splenocyte proliferation over control and E-ALT-2 respectively. Splenocytes produced predominant IFN-gamma followed by IL-5, IL-2 and IL-10 specifying a balanced Th1/Th2 response. P-TUFT-ALT-2 showed 55% to 80% with an average of 65% cytotoxicity in B. malayi L3 larvae in in vitro ADCC assay.

However, the high cost and low efficiency of phospholipase limit the application of enzymatic degumming. In this study, an 879 bp outer membrane phospholipase A (A1) (OM-PLA1) gene encoding 292 amino acid residues was isolated from the genome of Serratia marcescens. The recombinant OM-PLA1 profile of appropriately 33 KDa was expressed by the engineered Pichia pastoris GS115. The OM-PLA1 activity was 21.2 U/mL with the induction of 1 mM methanol for 72 h. The expression efficiencies of OM-PLA1 were 0.29 U/mL/h and 1.06 U/mL/OD600. A complex of magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) and OM-PLA1 (MGO-OM-PLA1) was prepared by immobilizing OM-PLA1 with graphene oxide-based Fe3O4 nanoparticles by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The content of phosphorus decreased to 5.1 mg/kg rapeseed oil from 55.6 mg/kg rapeseed oil with 0.02% MGO-OM-PLA1 (w/w) at 50 degrees C for 4 h. MGO-OM-PLA1 retained 51.7% of the initial activity after 13 times of continuous recycling for the enzymatic degumming of rapeseed oil.

To prevent the proliferation of undesired microorganisms, to retain labile and volatile flavor compounds, and to save energy, the current trend is to perform this process at low temperatures. However, the commercially available pectinases are highly active at temperatures approximately 50 degrees C and poorly active at temperatures below 35 degrees C, which is the reason why there is a constant search for cold-active pectinases. In preliminary studies, pectinolytic activity was detected in cold-adapted yeasts and yeast-like microorganisms isolated from Antarctica. The aim of the present work was to characterize pectinases secreted by these microorganisms and to express the best candidate in Pichia pastoris.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Degradation of pectin by extracellular protein extracellular extracts obtained from 12 yeast cultures were assayed in plates at 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C and pH from 5.4 to 7.0, obtaining positive results in samples obtained from Dioszegia sp., Phenoliferia glacialis and Tetracladium sp. An enzyme was purified from Tetracladium sp., analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting and compared to genome and transcriptome data from the same microorganism. Thus, the encoding gene was identified corresponding to a polygalacturonase-encoding gene. The enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the recombinant polygalacturonase displayed higher activity at 15 degrees C than a mesophilic counterpart.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Extracellular pectinase activity was found in three yeast and yeast-like microorganisms from which the highest activity was displayed by Tetracladium sp., and the enzyme was identified as a polygalacturonase. The recombinant polygalacturonase produced in P. pastoris showed high activity at 15 degrees C, representing an attractive candidate to be applied in clarification processes in the production of fermented beverages and fruit juices.</p></details></div>

In this study, we developed and characterized a novel monoclonal S1P1 antibody. Mice were immunized with S1P1 produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris and nine hybridoma clones producing monoclonal antibodies were created. Using different technical approaches including Western blot, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry, we show that a selected clone, hereinafter referred to as 2B9, recognizes human and mouse S1P1 in various cell lineages. The interaction between 2B9 and S1P1 is specific over receptor subtypes, as the antibody does not binds to S1P2 or S1P5 receptors. Using cell-imaging methods, we demonstrate that 2B9 binds to an epitope located at the intracellular domain of S1P1; reveals cytosolic and membrane localization of the endogenous S1P1; and receptor internalization upon S1P or FTY720-P stimulation. Finally, loss of 2B9 signal upon knockdown of endogenous S1P1 by specific small interference RNAs further confirms its specificity. 2B9 was also able to detect S1P1 in human kidney and spinal cord tissue by immunohistochemistry. Altogether, our results suggest that 2B9 could be a useful tool to detect, quantify or localize low amounts of endogenous S1P1 in various physiological and pathological processes.</p></details></div>

Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the genes involved in sea cucumber reproductive processes. The neurohormone relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide (RGP) has been identified as the active gonad-stimulating peptide in sea stars (Asteroidea), which could also be present in other echinoderm groups. In this study, a sea cucumber RGP was identified and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. A recombinant Holothuria scabra RGP was produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris and confirmed by mass spectrometry. To assess bioactivity, four levels of purification were tested in an in vitro germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) bioassay. The most pure form induced 98.56 +/- 1.19% GVBD in H. scabra and 89.57 +/- 1.19% GVBD in Holothuria leucospilota. Cruder levels of purification still resulted in some GVBD. Upon single injection into female H. scabra, the recombinant RGP induced head waving behavior followed by spawning within 90-170 min. Spawned oocytes were fertilized successfully, larvae settled and developed into juveniles. Our results provide a key finding for the development of a break-through new artificial breeding approach in sea cucumber aquaculture.</p></details></div>

Translational pausing coordinates protein translation and co-translational folding. Decelerating translation elongation speed has been shown to improve the soluble protein yield when expressing heterologous proteins in industrial expression hosts. However, rational redesign of translational pausing via synonymous mutations may not be feasible in many cases. Our goal was to develop a general and convenient strategy to improve heterologous protein synthesis in Pichia pastoris without mutating the expressed genes. Results: Here, a large-scale deletion library of ribosomal protein (RP) genes was constructed for heterologous protein expression in Pichia pastoris, and 59% (16/27) RP deletants have significantly increased heterologous protein yield. This is due to the delay of 60S subunit assembly by deleting non-essential ribosomal protein genes or 60S subunit processing factors, thus globally decreased the translation elongation speed and improved the co-translational folding, without perturbing the relative transcription level and translation initiation. Conclusion: Global decrease in the translation elongation speed by RP deletion enhanced co-translational folding efficiency of nascent chains and decreased protein aggregates to improve heterologous protein yield. A potential expression platform for efficient pharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes production was provided without synonymous mutation.</p></details></div>

To date, expression hosts for purification of AID/APOBEC3 enzymes include bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Here the establishment and optimization of a yeast expression/secretion system for AID/APOBEC3s are reported, followed by comparison with the same enzymes expressed in bacterial and mammalian hosts. AID and APOBEC3G were expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, each either with an N-terminal GST tag, C-terminal V5-His tag or as untagged native form. It was verified that the yeast-expressed enzymes exhibit identical biochemical properties to those reported using bacterial and mammalian expression, indicating high fidelity of protein folding. It was demonstrated that the system can be adapted for secretion of the enzymes into the media which was used directly in various enzyme assays. The system is also amenable to elimination of bulky fusion tags, providing native untagged enzymes. Thus, P. pastoris is an advantageous expression factory for AID/APOBEC3 enzymes, considering the cost, time, efficiency and quality of the obtained enzymes. The first report is also provided here of a functionally active, untagged, secreted AID, which may become a useful research reagent. A comprehensive comparison is made of the effect of fusion tags and expression hosts on the biochemical actions of AID and APOBEC3G.</p></details></div>

The E. coli SHu ffl e system was demonstrated to be superior to P. pastoris in generating high-levels of recombinant proteins that were soluble and stable. In addition, protein extracts from P. pastoris induced non-specific chlorosis on wheat, postulated to be caused by co-purified glucanases secreted by the host. Up to 79.6 mug/ml of ToxB was obtained using the SHu ffl e system in the absence of the native signal peptide, whilst the ToxA yield was considerably lower at 3.2 mug/ml. Results indicated that a histidine tag at the ToxA C-terminus interfered with effector functionality. Heterologously expressed ToxA and ToxB were tested on a panel of Australian cereals, including 122 varieties of bread wheat, 16 durum, 20 triticale and 5 barley varieties, as well as common plant model species including tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana. A varying degree of effector sensitivities was observed, with a higher ToxB sensitivity and prevalence in the durum and triticale varieties. ToxB-induced chlorosis was also detected on barley.

However, the enzyme displayed two electrophoretic forms due to heterogeneity of N-glycosylation at Asn354. The deglycosylation mutant N354D shared the same properties with wild-type AgdB. N354D demonstrated hydrolytic specificity toward alpha-(1-->3)- and alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic linkages, indicating that AgdB is an alpha-1,3-/alpha-1,4-glucosidase. N354D-catalyzed transglucosylation from maltose was analyzed in short- and long-term reactions, enabling us to learn the transglucosylation specificity and product accumulation, respectively.

For identity confirmation of metabolites at the MS2 level, an alternating frame approach was chosen and two different strategies were tested: a data-independent all-ions acquisition and a quadrupole broad band isolation (Q-BBI) directed by IM drift separation.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> For Q-BBI analysis, the broad mass range isolation was successfully optimized in accordance with the distinctive drift time to m/z correlation of the dansyl derivatives. To guarantee comprehensive sampling, a broad mass isolation window of 70 Da was employed. Fragmentation was performed via collision-induced dissociation, applying a collision energy ramp optimized for the dansyl derivatives. Both approaches were studied in terms of linear dynamic range and repeatability employing ethanolic extracts of Pichia pastoris spiked with 1 muM metabolite mixture. Example data obtained for histidine and glycine showed that drift time precision (<0.01 to 0.3% RSD, n = 5) compared very well with the data reported in an earlier IM-TOFMS-based study.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Chimeric mass spectra, inherent to data-independent analysis approaches, are reduced when using a drift time directed Q-BBI approach.

Alternative Saccharomyces cerevisiae ASNase II coded by the ASP3 gene was biosynthesized by recombinant Pichia pastoris MUT (s) under the control of the AOX1 promoter, using different cultivation strategies. In particular, we applied multistage fed-batch cultivation divided in four distinct phases to produce ASNase II and determine the fermentation parameters, namely specific growth rate, biomass yield, and enzyme activity. Cultivation of recombinant P. pastoris under favorable conditions in a modified defined medium ensured a dry biomass concentration of 31 gdcw.L(-1) during glycerol batch phase, corresponding to a biomass yield of 0.77 gdcw.g glycerol - 1 and a specific growth rate of 0.21 h(-1). After 12 h of glycerol feeding under limiting conditions, cell concentration achieved 65 gdcw.L(-1) while ethanol concentration was very low. During the phase of methanol induction, biomass concentration achieved 91 gdcw.L(-1), periplasmic specific enzyme activity 37.1 U.g dcw - 1 , volumetric enzyme activity 3,315 U.L(-1), overall enzyme volumetric productivity 31 U.L(-1).h(-1), while the specific growth rate fell to 0.039 h(-1). Our results showed that the best strategy employed for the ASNase II production was using glycerol fed-batch phase with pseudo exponential feeding plus induction with continuous methanol feeding.</p></details></div>

HATs are composed of two subunits, a heavy and a light subunit, which belong to the solute carrier (SLC) families SLC3 and SLC7. The two subunits are linked by a conserved disulfide bridge. Several human diseases are associated with loss of function or overexpression of specific HATs making them drug targets. The human HAT 4F2hc-LAT2 (SLC3A2-SLC7A8) is specific for the transport of large neutral L-amino acids and specific amino acid-related compounds. Human 4F2hc-LAT2 can be functionally overexpressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and pure recombinant protein purified. Here we present the first cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D-map of a HAT, i.e., of the human 4F2hc-LAT2 complex. The structure could be determined at ~13 A resolution using direct electron detector and Volta phase plate technologies. The 3D-map displays two prominent densities of different sizes. The available X-ray structure of the 4F2hc ectodomain fitted nicely into the smaller density revealing the relative position of 4F2hc with respect to LAT2 and the membrane plane.</p></details></div>

According to the codon bias of Pichia genome, the XynB gene from T. reesei was optimized and synthesized by whole gene assembly to improve its expression level in P. pastoris. Approximately 180 target mutations were successfully introduced into natural XynB. The maximum activity of xylanase (optiXynB) secreted by P. pastoris pPICZaA-optiXynB was 1299 U/mL after 96 h induction. Purified recombinant optiXynB had the molecular weight of 24 kDa. The optiXynB presented highest activity in pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C. The recombinase was highly specific towards birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, and oat-spelt xylan. In the broiler experiment, a total of 200 Arbor Acre broilers (one day old) were randomly allocated into four groups fed with basal diets containing 0 (control group), 500, 1000, and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB. Dietary 1000 and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB significantly increased (p < 0.05) final weight and body weight gain; dietary 500, 1000, and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB significantly increased (p < 0.05) pre-evisceration weight, dressed percentage, and eviscerated weight compared with the control group. Inclusion of optiXynB in broiler diets linearly increased final weight, body weight gain, breast muscle weight and leg muscle weight, but linearly decreased feed conversion rate (p < 0.05). Furthermore, inclusion of optiXynB in broiler diets linearly and quadratically increased pre-evisceration weight, dressed percentage, and eviscerated weight (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the gene fusion yielded a positive effect with respect to the wild-type recombinant enzyme in terms of both immobilization and stability. The multi-well plate with the immobilized chimera was used to develop an optical biosensor to monitor two phenolic compounds: L-DOPA ((S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid) and caffeic acid (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid); the estimation of which is a matter of interest in the pharmaceutics and food field. The method was based on the use of the analytes as competing inhibitors of the laccase-mediated ABTS oxidation.

Glucuronoyl esterases are considered to play a unique role as accessory enzymes in lignocellulosic material biodegradation by cleaving the covalent ester linkage between 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) and lignin in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). Two glucuronoyl esterases from T. terrestris named TtGE1 and TtGE2 were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Both esterases displayed features of thermophilic enzymes, with the optimal temperature at 45 degrees C and 55 degrees C. TtGE1 and TtGE2 exhibited activity towards methyl (4-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranosid) uronate (Me-GlcA-pNP) but no catalytic activity to benzyl-D-glucuronate (BnzGlcA), indicating the difference in substrate specificity from previously studied fungal GEs. A substantial increase in the release of monomeric sugars and glucuronic acid from autohydrolysis of corn bran was observed by the supplementing TtGEs into commercial xylanase; the results clearly demonstrated that the TtGEs played a significant role in this degradation process. This research on TtGEs enriches our knowledge of this novel class of fungal GEs. These newly characterized TtGEs could be used as promising accessory enzymes to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of commercial enzymes in saccharification of lignocellulosic materials due to their thermophilic characteristics.</p></details></div>

They are important immune factors resisting pathogenic bacteria infection for mollusks. The 43 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminal for Crassostrea gigas defensin (CgD) form its mature peptide region, responsible for the biological activity of CgD. First, two target genes, CgDH(+) (with 6xHis-tag at 3' end) and CgDH- (without 6xHis-tag at 3' end) were separated and amplified by RT-PCR with specific primers from Crassostrea gigas mantle. These two target genes were ligated to the expression vector pPICZalphaA to construct recombinant expression vectors, pPICZalphaA-CgDH(+) and pPICZalphaA-CgDH-, which were transformed into competent Pichia pastoris X-33 cells by electroporation respectively. The recombinant target proteins, CgDH(+) and CgDH-, were induced for 72 h with 1% methanol at 29 degrees C and 250 r/min. The recombinant CgDH(+) (5.78 kDa) was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis, demonstrating that it was the expected target protein. Based on the concentration of the purified product, the estimated yield of recombinant CgDH(+) was 2.32 mg/L. Antimicrobial assay showed that the culture medium supernatant containing recombinant CgDH(+) and recombinant CgDH-, respectively, had activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that the existence of 6xHis tag in the recombinant proteins do not affect their biological activities.</p></details></div>

In order to explore the effect of the changes of tRNAs corresponding to rare codons (rarity tRNAs) on the expression of exogenous genes, the co-expression system of rare tRNA gene and exogenous gene in Pichia pastoris was constructed. The expression of GFP in P. pastoris can be greatly reduced when a repressor region composed of four continuous proline rare codon CCG was added into the GFP gene. The expression amount of the repressed GFP could be increased about 4.9% when tRNAProCCG gene was cointegrated to the 3' of the repressed GFP gene through pPIC9K to the genome of P. pastoris GS115. Meanwhile, the expression amount of the repressed GFP increased about 12.5% by integrating the repressed GFP gene and tRNAProCCG gene to the genome of P. pastoris GS115 through pPIC9K and pFLDalpha, respectively. Using the same method, NFATc3T-GFP fusion gene and tRNAProCCG gene were co-expressed in P. pastoris GS115 resulting in 21.3% increased of the expression amount of NFATc3T-GFP fusion protein. In conclusion, tRNAProCCG gene has been confirmed to be a kind of rare tRNAs in P. pastoris GS115. Through co-expression of tRNAProCCG gene and heterologous genes which containing the continuous rare codon CCG, the expression of the repressed heterologous genes could be increased significantly.

However, due to its toxicity and flammability, there is a desire to avoid methanol while maintaining the high productivity of P. pastoris. Small scale bioreactor cultivations (0.5-5 L working volume) are commonly used to evaluate a strain and its protein production characteristics since microscale cultivation in deep well plates can be hardly controlled or relies on expensive equipment. Furthermore, traditional protocols for the cultivation and induction of P. pastoris were established for constitutive expression or methanol induction and so far, no reliable protocols were described to screen P. pastoris expression strains with derepressible promoters in (controlled and monitored) parallel cultivations. To simplify such initial cultivations to characterize and compare new protein production strains, we established a simple shake flask cultivation system for methanol free expression that simulates bioreactor conditions including a constant slow glycerol feed and online monitoring, thereby coming closer to the real conditions in bioreactors compared to mostly applied small scale batch cultivations. To drive recombinant protein expression in P. pastoris, the carbon source repressed promoters PDC and PDF were applied. Polymer discs with embedded carbon source, releasing a constant amount of glycerol, assured a feed rate delivering the necessary energy for maintaining the promoters active while keeping the biomass generation low.</p></details></div>

The most effective method of protection against influenza virus and the way to reduce the risk of epidemic or pandemic spread is vaccination. Influenza vaccine manufactured in a traditional way, though well developed, has some drawbacks and limitations which have stimulated interest in developing alternative approaches. In this study, we demonstrate that the recombinant H1 vaccine based on the hydrophilic haemagglutinin (HA) domain and produced in the yeast system elicited high titres of serum haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in mice. Transmission electron microscopy showed that H1 antigen oligomerizes into functional higher molecular forms similar to rosette-like structures. Analysis of the N-linked glycans using mass spectrometry revealed that the H1 protein is glycosylated at the same sites as the native HA. The recombinant antigen was secreted into a culture medium reaching approximately 10 mg/l. These results suggest that H1 produced in Pichia pastoris can be considered as the vaccine candidate against H1N1 virus.</p></details></div>

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the production of lactic acid from methanol using a lactate dehydrogenase copy number amplifying strategy in Pichia pastoris. We engineered methylotrophic yeast (Pichia pastoris) producing D-lactic acid by D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (d-LDH) integration into the non-transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus and post-transformational amplification. The resultant engineered strains GS115/S8/Z3 and GS115/S16/Z3 produced 3.48 and 3.26 g/L of D-lactic acid from methanol, respectively, in a 96-h test tube fermentation. To our knowledge, this is the first report about D-lactic acid production from methanol by an engineered P. pastoris strain. The technique of gene integration into the rDNA locus and post-transformational gene amplification could be useful for metabolic engineering in P. pastoris, and the chemical production from methanol by engineered P. pastoris represents a promising industrial technology.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp. ) is one of the strongest promoters for heterologous gene expression. Although increasing the gene dosage is a common strategy to improve recombinant protein productivities, P. pastoris strains harboring more than two copies of a Rhizopus oryzae lipase gene (ROL) have previously shown a decrease in cell growth, lipase production, and substrate consumption, as well as a significant transcriptional downregulation of methanol metabolism. This pointed to a potential titration effect of key transcriptional factors methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1) and methanol-induced transcription factor (Mit1) regulating methanol metabolism caused by the insertion of multiple expression vectors. To prove this hypothesis, a set of strains carrying one and four copies of ROL (1C and 4C, respectively) were engineered to coexpress one or two copies of MXR1*, coding for an Mxr1 variant insensitive to repression by 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, or one copy of MIT1. Small-scale cultures revealed that growth, Rol productivity, and methanol consumption were improved in the 4C-MXR1* and 4C-MIT1, strains growing on methanol as a sole carbon source, whereas only a slight increase in productivity was observed for re-engineered 1C strains. We further verified the improved performance of these strains in glycerol-/methanol-limited chemostat cultures.</p></details></div>

Tachyplesin I (TP-I) is an antimicrobial peptide, which exhibits potent and broad-spectrum activities against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and tumor cells. However, limited amounts of TP-I produced in horseshoe crab restrict its large-scale use. In order to solve this problem, a eukaryotic expression system of Pichia pastoris with high TP-I expression was constructed by gene engineering. To achieve high expression of TP-I, 74 amino acid-long peptide (4TP-1) was designed containing 4 copies of TP-I, and specific cleavage sites for pancreatic elastase (-Ala downward arrow or -Gly downward arrow) and carboxypeptidase A (cleaves C terminal amino acid); these cleavage sites for enzymes were located between the four copies of TP-I. The gene sequence for the designed peptide was synthesized taking into consideration codon preferences for P. pastoris, and cloned into the highly efficient expression vector pGAPZalpha B. Host Pichia pastoris strain GS115cells were transfected by the constructed expression vector pGAPZalpha B-4tp-I by electroporation. Tricine-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was carried out to detect the expression of target peptides in the fermentation medium. This analysis showed a protein band of 3.3kDa, identical to that of chemically synthesized TP-I, verifying that successful synthesis and secretion of TP-I by genetically engineered P. pastoris. The concentration of TP-I in the fermentation broth was 27.24-29.53mg/L. High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis documented that the TP-I monomer had the same molecular weight, 2262.85, as the designed 17-amino acid sequence. The recombinant TP-I peptide displayed different levels of bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, the present study demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high levels of expression of TP-I in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

P. pastoris has two set of genes for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA1 and FBA2) and transaldolase (TAL1 and TAL2), although there are single-copy genes for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) and transketolase (TKL1), respectively. Expressions of FBP1 and TAL2 were upregulated by non-fermentative carbon sources, especially methanol was the best inducer for them, and FBA2 was induced only by methanol. On the other hand, FBA1, TAL1 and TKL1 showed constitutive expression. Strain fbp1Delta showed severe growth defect on methanol and non-fermentable carbon sources, and growth rate of strain fba2Delta in methanol medium was slightly decreased. Moreover, Fba2p and Tal2p possessed peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (PTS1), and EGFP-Fba2p and EGFP-Tal2p were found to be localized in peroxisomes. From these findings, it was suggested that Fba2p, Fbp1p and Tal2p participate in the rearrangement pathway for Xu5P in peroxisomes, and that the altered Calvin cycle and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway involving Tal2p function in a complementary manner.</p></details></div>

Although satisfactory results had been obtained with recombinant E. coli OPA, endotoxin and the use of multiple antibiotics along with toxic inducer brought the potential biosafety hazard for the clinical application of Ala-Gln.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, the safer host Pichia pastoris was applied as an alternative to E. coli. A recombinant P. pastoris (named GPA) with the original gene of alpha-amino acid ester acyltransferase (SsAet) from Sphingobacterium siyangensis SY1, was constructed to produce Ala-Gln. To improve the expression efficiency of SsAet in P. pastoris, codon optimization was conducted to obtain the strain GPAp. Here, we report that Ala-Gln production by GPAp was approximately 2.5-fold more than that of GPA. The optimal induction conditions (cultivated for 3 days at 26 degrees C with a daily 1.5% of methanol supplement), the optimum reaction conditions (28 degrees C and pH 8.5), and the suitable substrate conditions (AlaOMe/Gln = 1.5/1) were also achieved for GPAp. Although most of the metal ions had no effects, the catalytic activity of GPAp showed a slight decrease in the presence of Fe(3+) and an obvious increase when cysteine or PMSF were added. Under the optimum conditions, the Ala-Gln generation by GPAp realized the maximum molar yield of 63.5% and the catalytic activity of GPAp by agar embedding maintained extremely stable after 10 cycles.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Characterized by economy, efficiency and practicability, production of Ala-Gln by recycling immobilized GPAp (whole-cell biocatalyst) is represents a green and promising way in industrial.</p></details></div>

Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT), responsible for the last step of triacylglycerol synthesis in the acyl-CoA-independent pathway, has attracted much attention by catalyzing membrane lipid transformation. However, due to lack of biochemical and enzymatic studies, PDAT has not carried forward in biocatalyst application. Here, the PDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified enzymes were studied using different acyl donors and acceptors by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography. In addition of the preferred acyl donor of PE and PC, the results identified that ScPDAT was capable of using broad acyl donors such as PA, PS, PG, MGDG, DGDG, and acyl-CoA, and ScPDAT was more likely to use unsaturated acyl donors comparing 18:0/18:1 to 18:0/18:0 phospholipids. With regard to acyl acceptors, ScPDAT preferred 1,2 to 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG), while 12:0/12:0 DAG was identified as the optimal acyl acceptor, followed by 18:1/18:1 and 18:1/16:0 DAG. Additionally, ScPDAT reveals esterification activity that can utilize methanol as acyl acceptor to generate fatty acid methyl esters.

Various optimization strategies of processes based on AOX1 promoter have been investigated, including methanol co-feeding with glycerol or sorbitol during the induction stage. Compared with carbon sources, comparatively little research has been devoted to the effects of nitrogen sources. Several reports have described the benefits of adding casamino acids (CA) to the recombinant protein production medium, however, without considering its effects at the gene expression level. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter protein, monitored using flow cytometry, CA was shown to downregulate AOX1 promoter induction. Despite higher growth rates, cultures containing CA exhibited slower transition to the induced state, whereas metabolite analysis revealed that methanol consumption was reduced in the presence of CA compared with its absence. The repressive effect of CA was further confirmed by analysing the synthesis of extracellular recombinant Candida antarctica lipase under control of the AOX1 promoter.

Since ester bonds are destroyed during the alkali extraction process, xylanase and arabinofuranosidase are mainly used to hydrolyze xylooligosaccharides. However, alkali extraction costs are very high, and the method also causes pollution. Therefore, this study focuses on elucidating a method to efficiently and directly degrade destarched wheat bran. First, an acidic acetyl xylan esterase (AXE) containing a carbohydrate-binding module-1 (CBM1) domain was cloned from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Characterization showed that the full-length acetyl xylan esterase AXE + CBM1 was similar toe uncovered AXE with an optimum temperature and pH of 55 degrees C and 6.5, respectively. Testing the acetyl xylan esterase and xylanase derived from Neocallimastix patriciarum in a starch-free wheat bran cooperative experiment revealed that AXE + CBM1 and AXE produced 29% and 16% reducing sugars respectively, compared to when only NPXYN11 was used. In addition, introduced the CBM1 domain into NPXYN11, and the results indicated that the CBM1 domain showed little effect on NPXYN11 properties. Finally, the systematically synergistic effects between acetyl xylan esterase and xylanase with/without the CBM1 domain demonstrated that the combined ratio of AXE + CBM1 coming in first and NPXYN11 + CBM1 s increased reducing sugars by almost 35% with AXE and NPXYN11.

Previous studies have shown that PLRA3 in Pichia pastoris is a strong rhamnose-inducible promoter for driving the industrial production of recombinant proteins. However, another important profile of PLRA3, the basal transcription, was not investigated yet. In this study, the basal transcription of PLRA3 was assessed according to the profiles of two test strains grown in media lacking rhamnose: (1) the production of secretory beta-galactosidase in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-LacB, in which lacB expression was regulated by PLRA3, and (2) growth in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-MazF, in which the expression of mazF, which encodes an intracellular toxic protein, was controlled by PLRA3. Analyses revealed low beta-galactosidase production and non-obviously inhibited growth of the test strains, which suggests that there was a low basal transcription level of PLRA3 when rhamnose was absent. Thus, PLRA3 was an excellent candidate for genetic manipulation in P. pastoris due to its strict regulation, a strong and a low transcriptional activity with and without rhamnose, respectively. Subsequently, two systems were developed based on PLRA3 in P. pastoris: (1) an efficient markerless gene deletion system for single or multiple genes and (2) a high efficient piggyBac transposase-mediated mutation system for investigating the functions of unknown genes, as well as for the screening of expected mutants.</p></details></div>

Thus, it is very important to develop genetic-engineering strains with high-yield NAGase to hydrolyze chitin into GlcNAc. Here, the NAGase gene of Bacillus subtilis 168 (BsnagZ) was synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris and expressed in P. pastoris. The expression level of BsNagZ in P. pastoris increased over the induced time and the highest activity reached 0.76 U/mL at the 7th day. The recombinant BsNagZ was purified for characterization. The optimal temperature and pH are 60 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. It can both keep over 80% activities after pre-incubation at 55 degrees C for one hour and at 4 degrees C for 12 h from pH 4.5 to 10.0. To further improve the expression level of BsNagZ, a recombinant strain with four copy BsnagZs was screened using a high concentration of zeocin. The highest BsNagZ activity reached 3.2 U/mL at the 12th day, which was fourfold higher than that of single-copy strain. Combined with commercial chitinase CtnSg, GlcNAc can be produced by recombinant BsNagZ when used colloidal chitin as the substrate.

Komagataella spp.). Nonetheless, the reduced number of carbon atoms and the symmetry of the glycerol molecule has hampered the comprehensive determination of metabolic fluxes when used as the labelled C-source. Moreover, metabolic models typically used for (13)C-based flux balance analysis may be incomplete or misrepresent the actual metabolic network. To circumvent these limitations, we reduced the genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026-v3.0 into a core model and used it for the iterative fitting of metabolic fluxes to the measured mass isotope distribution of proteinogenic amino acids obtained after fractional (13)C labelling of cells with [1,3-(13)C]-glycerol. This workflow allows reliable estimates to be obtained for in vivo fluxes in P. pastoris cells growing on glycerol as sole carbon source, as well as revising previous assumptions concerning its metabolic operation, such as alternative metabolic branches, calculation of energetic parameters and proposed specific cofactor utilisation.</p></details></div>

They are in most cases not synthesized in their target location and hence need to be transported to the site of action, by for instance ATP-binding cassette transporters. Within the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, Pleiotropic Drug Resistance transporters are known to be involved in phytohormone transport. Interestingly, PDRs are only present in plants and fungi. In contrast to fungi, there are few biochemical studies of plant PDRs and one major reason is that suitable overexpression systems have not been identified. In this study, we evaluate the expression system Pichia pastoris for heterologous overexpression of PDR genes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We successfully cloned and expressed the potential phytohormone transporters PDR2 and PDR8 in P. pastoris. Sucrose gradient centrifugation confirmed that the overexpressed proteins were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane of P. pastoris and initial functional studies demonstrated ATPase activity for WBC1. However, difficulties in cloning and heterologous overexpression might be particular obstacles of the PDR family, since cloning and overexpression of White Brown Complex 1, a half-size transporter of the same ABCG subfamily with comparable domain organization, was more easily achieved. We present strategies and highlight critical factors to successfully clone plant PDR genes and heterologously expressed in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

However, naturally isolated xylanases cannot withstand harsh conditions such as high temperature and basic pH. In this study, we performed structural analysis of the major T. reesei xylanase (Xyn2), and novel flexible regions of the enzyme were identified based on B-factor, a molecular dynamics (MD) parameter. To improve thermostability of the Xyn2, disulfide bonds were introduced into the unstable flexible region by using site-directed mutagenesis and two recombinant xylanases, XM1 (Xyn2Cys12-52) and XM2 (Xyn2Cys59-149) were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Secreted recombinant Xyn2 was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 24 kDa. Interestingly, the half-lives of XM1 and XM2 at 60 degrees C were 2.5- and 1.8- fold higher, respectively than those of native Xyn2. The XM1 also exhibited improved pH stability and maintained more than 60% activity over pH values ranging from 2.0 to 10.0. However, the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of XM1 was decreased as compared to those of XM2 and native Xyn2.

In here, a combinational strategy integrating codon optimization, multiple gene insertion, strong AOX1 promoter, and efficient secretion signal sequence was developed to obtain high-level secreted pIFN-alpha in Pichia pastoris GS115. The codon optimized pIFN-alpha shared 76% sequence identity with the original pIFN-alpha, which was inserted into the P. pastoris genome under AOX1d1-2x201 promoter and MF4I secretion sequence. Our results showed positive correlation between the mRNA and secreted protein levels with the copy numbers of genome-integrated pIFN-alpha gene in the recombinant P. pastoris strains. The recombinant opt-pIFN-alpha-6C strain bearing six copies of pIFN-alpha expression cassette produced the highest extracellular secretion of pIFN-alpha of 3.2 +/- 0.1 mg/mL in shake flask experiment, and 17.0 +/- 0.8 mg/mL in a 5 L high-cell-density cultivation after methanol induction of 84 h.

RNase 1 contains sequons for N-linked glycosylation at Asn34, Asn76, and Asn88 and is N-glycosylated at all three sites in vivo. The effect of N-glycosylation on the structure and function of RNase 1 is unknown. By using an engineered strain of the yeast Pichia pastoris, we installed a heptasaccharide (Man5GlcNAc2) on the side chain of Asn34, Asn76, and Asn88 to produce the authentic triglycosylated form of human RNase 1. As a glutamine residue is not a substrate for cellular oligosaccharyltransferase, we used strategic asparagine-to-glutamine substitutions to produce the three diglycosylated and three monoglycosylated forms of RNase 1. We found that the N-glycosylation of RNase 1 at any position attenuates its catalytic activity but enhances both its thermostability and its resistance to proteolysis. N-Glycosylation at Asn34 generates the most active and stable glycoforms, in accord with its sequon being highly conserved among vertebrate species. These data provide new insight on the biological role of the N-glycosylation of a human secretory enzyme.</p></details></div>

They directly act on proteins, affecting structure and function, or through receptor-mediated mechanisms. RAGE, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was identified as a receptor for AGEs. RAGE is involved in chronic inflammation, oxidative stress-based diseases and ageing. The majority of RAGE ligands bind to the VC1 domain. This domain was successfully expressed and secreted by Pichia pastoris. Out of two N-glycosylation sites, one (Asn25) was fully occupied while the other (Asn81) was under-glycosylated, generating two VC1 variants, named p36 and p34. Analysis of N-glycans and of their influence on VC1 properties were here investigated. The highly sensitive procainamide labeling method coupled to ES-MS was used for N-glycan profiling. N-glycans released from VC1 ranged from Man9GlcNAc2- to Man15GlcNAc2- with major Man10GlcNAc2- and Man11GlcNAc2- species for p36 and p34, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that VC1 maintains the same conformation also after removal of N-glycans. Thermal denaturation curves showed that the carbohydrate moiety has a small stabilizing effect on VC1 protein conformation. The removal of the glycan moiety did not affect the binding of VC1 to sugar-derived AGE- or malondialdehyde-derived ALE-human serum albumin. Given the crucial role of RAGE in human pathologies, the features of VC1 from P. pastoris will prove useful in designing strategies for the enrichment of AGEs/ALEs from plasma, urine or tissues, and in characterizing the nature of the interaction.</p></details></div>

The enzyme was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71H in a high yield and purified in a single step using anion-exchange chromatography. Homologous molecular modeling of this enzyme identified crucial differences in the enzyme active site that may be responsible for its high selectivity for N-acetylglucosamine substrates compared to fungal beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases from other sources. The enzyme was used in a sequential reaction together with a mutant beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from Talaromyces flavus with an enhanced synthetic capability, affording a bioactive disaccharide bearing an azido functional group. The azido function enabled an elegant multivalent presentation of this disaccharide on an aromatic carrier. The resulting model glycoconjugate is applicable as a selective ligand of galectin-3 - a biomedically attractive human lectin.

Amounts of biopharmaceutical drugs and industrial enzymes have been successfully produced by fed-batch high-cell-density fermentation (HCDF) of this cell factory. High levels of cell mass in defined media can be easily achieved and therefore large quantities of recombinant proteins with enhanced activities and lower costs can be obtained through HCDF technology. A robust HCDF process makes a successful transition to commercial production. Recently, efforts have been made to increase the heterologous protein production and activity by the HCDF of P. pastoris. However, challenges around selecting a suitable HCDF strategy exist. The high-level expression of a specific protein in P. pastoris is still, at least in part, limited by optimizing the methanol feeding strategy. Here, we review the progress in developments and applications of P. pastoris HCDF strategies for enhanced expression of recombinant proteins. We focus on the methanol induction strategies for efficient fed-batch HCDF in bioreactors, mainly focusing on various stat-induction strategies, co-feeding, and the limited induction strategy. These processes control strategies have opened the door for expressing foreign proteins in P. pastoris and are expected to enhance the production of recombinant proteins.</p></details></div>

RePriceXIP significantly inhibited the activity of GH11 xylanases in a concentration-dependent manner. The optimal inhibitory activity of rePriceXIP on GH11 xylanases (TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526) occurred at 40 degrees C for 30min. The IC50 values of rePriceXIP inhibiting TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 (0.5 U) were 45, 40, and 40nM, respectively. The Ki of rePriceXIP on TfxA_CD214 xylanase was 12.2nM. Increasing the concentration of rePriceXIP did not change Vmax, but increased Km, thereby suggesting that the inhibition was competitive.

HM is elongated by glycosyltransferases (GTs) from the cellulose synthase-like A (CSLA) family.

The specificity of the antibodies raised against mdFshbeta and mdLhbeta was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) for Fshbeta and Lhbeta on medaka pituitary tissue, while comparison with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for fshb and lhb mRNA was used for validation. Competitive ELISAs were developed using antibodies against mdFshbeta or mdLhbeta, and the tethered proteins mdFshbetaalpha or mdLhbetaalpha for standard curves. The standard curve for the Fsh ELISA ranged from 97.6pg/ml to 50ng/ml, and for the Lh ELISA from 12.21pg/ml to 6.25ng/ml. The sensitivity of the assays for Fsh and Lh was 44.7 and 70.8pg/ml, respectively. A profile of pituitary protein levels of medaka Fsh and Lh comparing juveniles with adults showed significant increase of protein amount from juvenile group (body length from 12mm to 16.5mm) to adult group (body length from 21mm to 26.5mm) for both hormones in male medaka. Comparing these data to a developmental profile of pituitary mRNA expression of medaka fshb and lhb, the mRNA expression of lhb also increased during male maturation and a linear regression analysis revealed a significant increase of lhb expression with increased body length that proposes a linear model. However, fshb mRNA expression did not change significantly during male development and therefore was not correlated with body length. In summary, we have developed and validated homologous ELISA assays for medaka Fsh and Lh based on proteins produced in P. pastoris, assays that will be used to study the functions and regulations of Fsh and Lh in more detail.</p></details></div>

Since the process dynamics typically exhibit nonlinear interactions amongst the critical process variables, the commonly employed controllers are suboptimal for control of most bioprocesses. In this article, we present the implementation of an augmented controller for improving the production of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) using Pichia pastoris. The augmented controller consists of a decoupled adaptive control (DAC) and a decoupled input-output linearizing control (DIOLC) in a combined architecture that permits simultaneous control of substrate concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration, sampled at different rates during fed-batch fermentation. The performance of DAC-DIOLC controller was compared to the performance of DAC and DIOLC implemented individually on the process. Our results show that the augmented controller better regulates the substrate and dissolved oxygen (DO), along the desired control trajectory compared to the individual DAC and DIOLC controllers. The performance of the augmented DAC-DIOLC controller showed deviations of only 0.021 g/L from substrate set point compared to 0.09 g/L in PID and 0.031 g/L in DIOLC, and a 1.12% deviation from DO set point compared to 11.86% in PID and 2.58% in DAC.

High level of extracellular amylase production of 72 U/mL was obtained after a 72 h induction by methanol. As expected, the recombinant strain produced only the AmyA isoform since the host is a protease deficient strain. Besides, the purified r-AmyA showed a molecular mass of 54 kDa, the same pH optimum equal to 5.6 but a higher thermoactivity of 60 degrees C against 50 degrees C for the native enzyme. Unlike AmyA which maintained 50% of its activity after a 10-min incubation at 60 degrees C, r-AmyA reached 45 min. The higher thermoactivity and thermostability could be related to the N-glycosylation. The r-AmyA activity was enhanced by 46% and 45% respectively in the presence of 4 mM Fe(2+) and Mg(2+) ions. This enzyme was more efficient in bread-making since such ions were reported to have a positive impact on the nutriment quality and the rheological characteristics of the wheat flour dough. The thermoactivity/thermostability as well as the iron and magnesium activations could also be ascribed to the presence of an additional C-terminal loop containing the His tag.</p></details></div>

Here, we report the cloning, heterologous expression, purification and characterization of a novel LMCO from the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila. The 1953 bp lmco gene sequence comprises of 3 exons interrupted by 2 introns and according to the LccED database the translated sequence belongs to superfamily 6 of multicopper oxidases. After removal of the introns, the gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris, under the control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous enzyme was purified with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa. TtLMCO1 displayed optimum activity at pH 4 and 50 degrees C and appeared thermostable up to 50 degrees C. A variety of phenolic compounds were oxidized by TtLMCO1, including standard laccase substrates such as ABTS and 2,6 dimethoxyphenol. The UV/Vis spectrum of purified TtLMCO1 indicates that it belongs to yellow laccase-like oxidases. The enzyme was used for the bioconversion of 2',3,4-trihydroxychalcone to 3',4'-dihydroxy-aurone, a bioactive aurone recently shown to possess inhibitory activity against several isoforms of the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Overall, the thermophilic yellow LMCO TtLMCO1 presents a number of superior properties with potential use in industrial biocatalysis.</p></details></div>

Both lipases were active on insoluble triglycerides as well as natural oils and hydrolyzed preferably esters with short and medium acyl and alkyl chains. Both enzymes were slightly selective for the (S)-glycidyl butyrate enantiomer and had a remarkable preference for the sn-2 position of triglycerides. The optimal activity was 40 and 50 degrees C for UMLA and CALA, respectively.

The recombinant P. pastoris was inoculated in to BMMY culture medium, incubation with 5mul/ml absolute methanol for 72hat 30 degrees C. The TC-1 peptide was concentrated with nickel affinity chromatography and electrophoresis on 16% acrylamide gels. The molecular weight of recombinant TC-1 is approximately 8kDa and under these conditions, the concentration of TC-1 considered 190mug/ml that determined by the Bradford method. The antimicrobial activity test (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) was done against: Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of these pathogenic bacteria was limited when we used peptide at a concentration of as low as 19.56mug/ml. Based on DPPH radical scavenging (DPPH-RS) activity and reducing power assays, this peptide showed relatively good antioxidant potential in comparison with standard antioxidant used in this study (BHT).

In this study, we obtained a multi-copy irisin-expressing P. pastoris strain through an optimized method, which is pH5.5, 1.8% methanol for 96h, for producing a high amount of recombinant irisin protein following a series of screening and optimization procedures. The higher-glycosylated irisin, which is supposed to be the active form was obtained by dialysis and ion-exchange chromatography purification method. Both of the laser scanning confocal microscope and the atomic force microscope not only detected the high-effectiveness entering cells of FITC-irisin but also localized it on the membrane of HepG2 cells.

In the present study, a novel LRR-only protein (designated CfLRRop-7) was identified in Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. The full-length cDNA sequence of CfLRRop-7 was 1463 bp and contained an open reading frame of 1086 bp, which encoded a protein of 361 amino acids. Five LRR motifs with a conserved signature sequence LxxLxLxxNxL were identified in the predicted protein sequence. The expression of CfLRRop-7 was particularly high in hemocytes. The expression of CfLRRop-7 was relatively high in oocytes and embryos during the ontogenesis of scallops. CfLRRop-7 expression changed in hemocytes in response to stimulation with different microbes, including Vibrio splendidus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pichia pastoris. CfLRRop-7 recognized five kinds of ligands/agonists. CfLRRop-7 recombinant protein inhibited bacterial proliferation in hemolymph and induced lysozyme activity in serum. After knocking down CfLRRop-7, the mRNA expression of selected antimicrobial peptides was reduced.

The oxidative stress inflicts severe injury to yeast cells, which causes cell death and reduces protein expression ability. N-acetyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can protect yeast cells from damage caused by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oxidative pressure environments such as ethanol treatment, freeze-thawing, or heat shock. In this study, N-acetyltransferase from P. pastoris (PpMpr1) was overexpressed for the first time to improve the anti-oxidative stress ability to protect cells from strong ROS damage during the methanol induction phase. Cell viability of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain increased significantly, while biomass was increased by 22.7% at high dissolved oxygen (DO). At the same time, the heterologous alpha-glucosidase (AGL) expression level at 25% DO was increased by 21.5%. The AGL degradation was greatly relieved in the fermentation supernatant of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain. This study shows that PpMpr1 has a great potential for improvement of anti-oxidative stress ability in P. pastoris and provides a promising recombinant microorganism for industrial production of proteins.</p></details></div>

Additionally, the recombinant expression of nanobodies is robust in various expression systems, such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. P. pastoris is the most widely used microorganism for nanobody production, but all or almost all expression vectors developed for this system are based on the regulated promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1) that requires methanol for full induction. In this study, a constitutive anti-CEACAM5 nanobody expression system was constructed under the control of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (GAP) promoter. The effects of different carbon sources and pH on nanobody expression were evaluated in shaking flask cultures. After 96h of constitutive expression in shaking flask, a yield of 51.71mg/L was obtained. In addition, this constitutive expression system produced nanobodies at equivalent yield and affinity to that produced by methanol-induced expression.

The recombinant protein was glycosylated precursor, that further undergoes limited autoproteolytic processing into two subunits (alpha and beta) which are visible in SDS-PAGE. The zebrafish AC is heterodimer associated with an inter-subunit disulfide bond. SDS-PAGE estimated the mass of native enzyme to be approximately 50kDa & size exclusion chromatography estimated the mass of the active enzyme as approximately 100kDa, suggesting the formation of a dimer of heterodimers.

Recombinant chymosin is the best alternative for the dairy industry due to the differences in physicochemical properties of coagulating enzymes and scarcity of chymosin from animal sources. In this study, glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of yak chymosin were extracellularly produced in a methylotrophic yeast, Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris). Synthetic yak prochymosin genes were cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector, expressed in P. pastoris GS115 (PDI) strain. Active chymosin expression was achieved into supernatant with Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor under the control of methanol-inducible AOXI promoter. The glycosylation of yak chymosin did not have a significant effect on yield and activity at shake flask level. In a 5L fermentor, production of native yak-chymosin was achieved and the enzyme activity was found as 214 IMCU/ml. pH of 6-7 and temperature of 40 degrees C values were optimum for the enzyme. The laboratory scale white cheese production yield with recombinant yak chymosin was very similar to a commercial bovine chymosin. These results indicate that P. pastoris expression system is very suitable for recombinant yak chymosin production to meet the needs of the cheese industry.</p></details></div>

Herein, we performed secretory expression of recombinant Tx4(6-1) using Pichia pastoris strain X33 as the host, and screened transformants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In flasks, approximately 5mg/l rTx4(6-1) was expressed as a secreted protein following induction with methanol, and this was increased to 45mg/l rTx4(6-1) in a fed-batch reactor. Approximately 4mg of high-purity rTx4(6-1) was purified from a 400ml fed-batch culture supernatant by Ni(+)-nitriloacetic acid affinity chromatography, followed by carboxymethyl (CM) sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. Purified rTx4(6-1) was determined by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, revealing a molecular weight (MW) of 7660.5Da, larger than the expected size due to O-linked glycosylation. Insect bioactivity tests of rTx4(6-1)-treated fifth-instar silkworm larvae (Bombyx mori Linnaeus) showed neurotoxin symptoms such as contraction paralysis, abdominal contraction, and mouth movement syndrome, with a half lethal dose at 12h post-injection of approximately 4.5-8.5mug/g body weight. Dietary toxicity was not observed in silkworm larvae.</p></details></div>

In the present work, Lcc9 cDNA was cloned from C. cinerea using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant laccase was found to be a heavily hyperglycoprotein, with the molecular weight of 60.2kDa as determined by MALDI-TOF. Laccase activity in the culture supernatant was 1750+/-83 U/L and reached 3138+/-62 U/L after expression condition optimization using orthogonal experiment. The biochemical property of the purified recombinant Lcc9 (rLcc9) was compared to that of wild-type Lcc9. rLcc9 shows a higher specific activity (315.3 U/mg) than Lcc9 (92.9 U/mg) when using ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sulfonate)) as the substrate. Although rLcc9 and Lcc9 showed comparable optimal pH (6.5) and temperature (70 degrees C) toward syringaldazine, rLcc9 displayed higher activity and stability in the pH range of 6.5-8.5. rLcc9 showed improved ability to oxidize indigo carmine and 5 azo dyes when methyl syringate was used as the mediator, with the decolorization rate range from 71.9+/-3.2% to 99.1+/-1.6% for different dyes in a wide pH (4.5-9.0) and temperature (4-70 degrees C) ranges. In comparison, Lcc9 decolorized 50.3+/-2.1% to 98.2+/-2.0% of the dyes used. The improved activity and stability in alkaline pH of rLcc9 relative to Lcc9, and improved dye decolorization ability towards 6 dyes suggested greater application potential of rLcc9 in biotechnologies such as wastewater treatment.</p></details></div>

Here, the results of an extensive mutagenesis study on three LPMO representatives, Phanerochaete chrysosporium LPMO9D (C1-oxidizer), Neurospora crassa LPMO9C (C4), and Hypocrea jecorina LPMO9A (C1/C4), are reported. Using a previously published indicator diagram, the authors demonstrate that several structural determinants of LPMOs play an important role in their oxidative regioselectivity. N-glycan removal and alterations of the aromatic residues on the substrate-binding surface are shown to alter C1/C4-oxidation ratios. Removing the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) is found not to alter the regioselectivity of HjLPMO9A, although the effect of mutational changes is shown to increase in a CBM-free context. The accessibility to the solvent-exposed axial position of the copper-site reveales not to be a major regioselectivity indicator, at least not in PcLPMO9D. Interestingly, a HjLPMO9A variant lacking two surface exposed aromatic residues combines decreased binding capacity with a 22% increase in synergetic efficiency. Similarly to recent LPMO10 findings, our results suggest a complex matrix of surface-interactions that enables LPMO9s not only to bind their substrate, but also to accurately direct their oxidative force.</p></details></div>

The degradation of chitin using chitinases is one way to address the accumulation of chitin waste streams in the environment, and research has therefore focused on the identification, improvement and expression of suitable enzymes. Here we describe the production, purification and characterization of Bacillus licheniformis chitinase A in the Pichia pastoris expression system. Optimal enzyme activity occurred at pH 4.0-5.0 and within the temperature range 50-60 degrees C. With colloidal chitin as the substrate, the Km (2.307mM) and Vmax (0.024mMmin(-1)) of the enzyme were determined using a 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay. The degradation products of colloidal chitin and hexa-N-acetylchitohexaose were compared by thin-layer chromatography. The activity of the glycosylated enzyme produced in P. pastoris was compared with the in vitro deglycosylated and aglycosylated version produced in Escherichia coli. We showed that the glycosylated chitinase was more active than the deglycosylated and aglycosylated variants.</p></details></div>

Innate immune signalling pathways triggered by rDer p 5 were investigated in airway epithelial cell activation assays in vitro.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Biophysical analysis showed that rDer p 5 was monomeric and adopted a similar alpha-helix-rich fold at both physiological and acidic pH. Spectrofluorimetry experiments showed that rDer p 5 is able to selectively bind lipid ligands, but only under mild acidic pH conditions. Computer-based docking simulations identified potential binding sites for these ligands. This allergen, with putatively associated lipid(s), triggered the production of IL-8 in respiratory epithelial cells through a TLR2-, NF-kB- and MAPK-dependent signalling pathway.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:</strong> Despite the fact that Der p 5 represents a HDM allergen of intermediate prevalence, our findings regarding its lipid binding and activation of TLR2 indicate that it could participate in the initiation of the HDM-allergic state.</p></details></div>

Given that their administration is relatively easy and stress-free, oral vaccines have both economic and animal welfare benefits. Yet, mostly due to their limited efficacy, only very few oral vaccines are available to aquaculture industry. Here we present a method for oral vaccine delivery based on the yeast Pichia pastoris. We could express a model antigen, green fluorescent protein (GFP), in this yeast and subsequently show delivery of the GFP protein to the intestine of juvenile flounder or adult carp and trout. We tested this approach in several commercially-relevant fish species, from juvenile to adult stage. To test the oral delivery of antigen to larval fish, the GFP-expressing Pichia pastoris was first fed to planktonic crustacean Daphnia or rotifers that served as 'bioencapsulation vehicles' and afterwards, fed to flounder larvae. Again, we could show delivery of intact GFP protein to the intestine. In rainbow trout, the orally-administered GFP-expressing yeast elicited a rapid local innate immune response in the intestine and a subsequent systemic response in the spleen. Our results show that Pichia pastoris is a good vehicle for oral antigen delivery and that it can be used in non-encapsulated form for older fish or in bioencapsulated form for larval fish. We discuss the immunomodulatory properties of the yeast itself, and its potential to enhance local immune responses and act as an adjuvant.</p></details></div>
