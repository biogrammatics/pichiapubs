Over the past five years, different strategies to improve the efficiency of recombinant protein expression by this yeast strain have been developed; these include a patent-free protein expression kit, construction of the P. pastoris CBS7435Ku70 platform strain with its high efficiency in site-specific recombination of plasmid DNA into the genomic DNA, the design of synthetic promoters and their variants by combining different core promoters with multiple putative transcription factors, the generation of mutant GAP promoter variants with various promoter strengths, codon optimization, engineering the alpha-factor signal sequence by replacing the native glutamic acid at the Kex2 cleavage site with the other 19 natural amino acids and the addition of mammalian signal sequence to the yeast signal sequence, and the co-expression of single chaperones, multiple chaperones or helper proteins that aid in recombinant protein folding. Publically available high-quality genome data from multiple strains of P. pastoris GS115, DSMZ 70382, and CBS7435 and the continuous development of yeast expression kits have successfully promoted the metabolic engineering of this strain to produce carotenoids, xanthophylls, nootkatone, ricinoleic acid, dammarenediol-II, and hyaluronic acid. The cell-surface display of enzymes has obviously increased enzyme stability, and high-level intracellular expression of acyl-CoA and ethanol O-acyltransferase, lipase and d-amino acid oxidase has opened up applications in whole-cell biocatalysis for producing flavor molecules and biodiesel, as well as the deracemization of racemic amino acids. High-level expression of various food-grade enzymes, cellulases, and hemicellulases for applications in the food, feed and biorefinery industries is in its infancy and needs strengthening.</p></details><hr><h4>Reduced methanol input induces increased protein output by AOX1 promoter in a trans-acting elements engineered Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. Wang et al., J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29230578>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>High oxygen consumption and heat release caused by methanol catabolism usually bring difficulties to industrial scale-up and cost for protein expression driven by methanol-induced AOX1 promoter in Pichia pastoris. Here, reduced methanol feeding levels were investigated for expression of insulin precursor in a trans-acting elements engineered P. pastoris strain MF1-IP. Insulin precursor expression level reached 6.69 g/(L supernatant) at the methanol feeding rate of 6.67 mL/(h.L broth), which was 59% higher than that in the wild-type strain WT-IP at the methanol feeding rate of 12 mL/(h.L broth). Correspondingly, the insulin precursor expression level in fermentation broth and maximum specific insulin precursor production rate was 137 and 77% higher than the WT-IP, respectively. However, oxygen consumption and heat evolution were reduced, and the highest oxygen consumption rate and heat evolution rate of the MF1-IP were 18.0 and 37.7% lower than the WT-IP, respectively.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical studies of two lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases from the white-rot fungus Heterobasidion irregulare and their roles in lignocellulose degradation.</h4><p>B. Liu et al., PLoS One 12 e0189479 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29228039>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) are important redox enzymes produced by microorganisms for the degradation of recalcitrant natural polysaccharides. Heterobasidion irregulare is a white-rot phytopathogenic fungus that causes wood decay in conifers. The genome of this fungus encodes 10 putative Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs. We describe the first biochemical characterization of H. irregulare LPMOs through heterologous expression of two CBM-containing LPMOs from this fungus (HiLPMO9H, HiLPMO9I) in Pichia pastoris. The oxidization preferences and substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined. The two LPMOs were shown to cleave different carbohydrate components of plant cell walls. HiLPMO9H was active on cellulose and oxidized the substrate at the C1 carbon of the pyranose ring at beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas HiLPMO9I cleaved cellulose with strict oxidization at the C4 carbon of glucose unit at internal bonds, and also showed activity against glucomannan. We propose that the two LPMOs play different roles in the plant-cell-wall degrading system of H. irregulare for degradation of softwood and that the lignocellulose degradation mediated by this white-rot fungus may require collective efforts from multi-types of LPMOs.</p></details><hr><h4>Gene cloning and expression of fungal lignocellulolytic enzymes from the rumen of gayal (Bos frontalis).</h4><p>J. Leng et al., J Gen Appl Microbiol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29225283>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A total of 6,219 positive clones were obtained by constructing a BAC library of uncultured ruminal fungi of gayal, and two clones (xynF1 and eglF2) with lignocellulolytic enzyme activity were selected. The sequencing results showed that xynF1 and eglF2 had 903-bp, and 1,995-bp, open reading frames likely to encode beta-xylanase (XynF1) and beta-glucosidase (EglF2), respectively. The amino acid sequence of XynF1 had 99% coverage and 95% homology to the endo-beta-1,4-xylanase encoded by the cellulase gene of Orpinomyces sp. LT-3 (GenBank accession No. AEO51791.1). The amino acid sequence of EglF2 had 99% coverage and 93% homology to the beta-glucosidase encoded by the cellulase gene of Piromyces sp. E2 (GenBank accession No. CAC34952.1). Analysis using the SMART software showed that XynF1 contains a glycoside hydrolase family 11 functional module and a carbohydrate-binding module, while EglF2 contains a glycoside hydrolase family 1 functional module. XynF1 showed the highest relative enzymatic activity, up to 95%, at 45 degrees C and pH 4.2, while EglF2 showed the highest relative enzymatic activity, up to 95%, at 55 degrees C and pH 6.2. In this study, we achieved efficient expression of the xynF1 and eglF2 genes in Pichia pastoris, which laid a foundation for the practical application of the lignocellulolytic enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Constitutive expression of the active fragment of human vasostatin Vs30 in Pichia pastoris SMD1168H.</h4><p>S. Calderon-Salais et al., Protein Expr Purif 144 40 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221829>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Vasostatin 30 (Vs30) is an active fragment derived from the N-terminal region (135-164 aa) of human calreticulin and has the ability to inhibit angiogenesis. In this work, the expression of Vs30 was performed using a protease-deficient strain of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The vs30 gene was optimized for P. pastoris preferential codon usage and inserted into constitutive expression vector pGAPZalphaA. In addition, a plasmid with four copies of the expression cassette was obtained and transformed into P. pastoris. The flask fermentation conditions were: culture volume of 25 mL in 250 mL baffled flasks at 28 degrees C, pH 6 and harvest time of 48 h. Up to 21.07 mg/L Vs30 were attained and purified by ultrafiltration with a 30-kDa cut-off membrane and the recovery was 49.7%. Bioactivity of Vs30 was confirmed by the inhibition of cell proliferation, as well as the inhibition of the capillary-like structures formation of EA.hy926 cells in vitro. This work constitutes the first report on the expression of Vs30 in Pichia pastoris using a constitutive promoter and multi-copy approach such as strategies to improve the recombinant Vs30 expression.</p></details><hr><h4>GoldenPiCS: a Golden Gate-derived modular cloning system for applied synthetic biology in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Prielhofer et al., BMC Syst Biol 11 123 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221460>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> State-of-the-art strain engineering techniques for the host Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella spp.) include overexpression of homologous and heterologous genes, and deletion of host genes. For metabolic and cell engineering purposes the simultaneous overexpression of more than one gene would often be required. Very recently, Golden Gate based libraries were adapted to optimize single expression cassettes for recombinant proteins in P. pastoris. However, an efficient toolbox allowing the overexpression of multiple genes at once was not available for P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> With the GoldenPiCS system, we provide a flexible modular system for advanced strain engineering in P. pastoris based on Golden Gate cloning. For this purpose, we established a wide variety of standardized genetic parts (20 promoters of different strength, 10 transcription terminators, 4 genome integration loci, 4 resistance marker cassettes).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> All genetic parts were characterized based on their expression strength measured by eGFP as reporter in up to four production-relevant conditions. The promoters, which are either constitutive or regulatable, cover a broad range of expression strengths in their active conditions (2-192% of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter P GAP ), while all transcription terminators and genome integration loci led to equally high expression strength. These modular genetic parts can be readily combined in versatile order, as exemplified for the simultaneous expression of Cas9 and one or more guide-RNA expression units. Importantly, for constructing multigene constructs (vectors with more than two expression units) it is not only essential to balance the expression of the individual genes, but also to avoid repetitive homologous sequences which were otherwise shown to trigger "loop-out" of vector DNA from the P. pastoris genome.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> GoldenPiCS, a modular Golden Gate-derived P. pastoris cloning system, is very flexible and efficient and can be used for strain engineering of P. pastoris to accomplish pathway expression, protein production or other applications where the integration of various DNA products is required. It allows for the assembly of up to eight expression units on one plasmid with the ability to use different characterized promoters and terminators for each expression unit. GoldenPiCS vectors are available at Addgene.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of N(alpha)-acetyl Talpha1-HSA through in vitro acetylation by RimJ.</h4><p>J. Chen et al., Oncotarget 8 95247 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221124>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Thymosin alpha 1 (Talpha1) is an important immunomodulating agent with various clinical applications. The natural form of Talpha1 is N(alpha) -acetylated, which was supposed to be related to in vivo stability of the hormone. In this study, fusion protein Talpha1-HSA was constructed and expressed in Pichia pastoris. RimJ, a N(alpha) -acetyltransferase from E.coli, was also overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. In vitro acetylation of Talpha1-HSA in the presence of RimJ and acetyl coenzyme A resulted in N(alpha) -acetyl Talpha1-HSA. The N(alpha) -acetylation was determined by LC-MS/MS. Kinetic assay indicated that RimJ had a higher affinity to desacetyl Talpha1 than to Talpha1-HSA. Bioactivity assay revealed fully retained activity of Talpha1 when the hormone was connected to the N-terminus of the fusion protein, while the activity was compromised in our previously constructed HSA-Talpha1. With fully retained activity and N-terminal acetylation, N(alpha) -acetyl Talpha1-HSA was expected to be a more promising pharmaceutical agent than Talpha1.</p></details><hr><h4>A bifunctional cellulase-xylanase of a new Chryseobacterium strain isolated from the dung of a straw-fed cattle.</h4><p>H. Tan et al., Microb Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29205864>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A new cellulolytic strain of Chryseobacterium genus was screened from the dung of a cattle fed with cereal straw. A putative cellulase gene (cbGH5) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 46 (GH5_46) was identified and cloned by degenerate PCR plus genome walking. The CbGH5 protein was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. It is the first bifunctional cellulase-xylanase reported in GH5_46 as well as in Chryseobacterium genus. The enzyme showed an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose of 3237 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 9, 90 degrees C and a xylanase activity on birchwood xylan of 1793 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 8, 90 degrees C. The activity level and thermophilicity are in the front rank of all the known cellulases and xylanases. Core hydrophobicity had a positive effect on the thermophilicity of this enzyme. When similar quantity of enzymatic activity units was applied on the straws of wheat, rice, corn and oilseed rape, CbGH5 could obtain 3.5-5.0x glucose and 1.2-1.8x xylose than a mixed commercial cellulase plus xylanase of Novozymes. When applied on spent mushroom substrates made from the four straws, CbGH5 could obtain 9.2-15.7x glucose and 3.5-4.3x xylose than the mixed Novozymes cellulase+xylanase. The results suggest that CbGH5 could be a promising candidate for industrial lignocellulosic biomass conversion.</p></details><hr><h4>Construction of a cellulose-metabolizing Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) by co-expressing glucanases and beta-glucosidase.</h4><p>T. Kickenweiz, A. Glieder, J. C. Wu, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204897>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cellulose is a highly available and renewable carbon source in nature. However, it cannot be directly metabolized by most microbes including Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris), which is a frequently employed host for heterologous protein expression and production of high-value compounds. A K. phaffii strain was engineered that constitutively co-expresses an endoglucanase and a beta-glucosidase both from Aspergillus niger and an exoglucanase from Trichoderma reesei under the control of bidirectional promoters. This engineered strain was able to grow on cellobiose and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) but not on Avicel. However, the detected release of cellobiose from Avicel by using the produced mixture of endoglucanase and exoglucanase as well as the released glucose from Avicel by using the produced mixture of all three cellulases at 50 degrees C indicated the production of exoglucanase under the liquid culture conditions. The successful expression of three cellulases in K. phaffii demonstrated the feasibility to enable K. phaffii to directly use cellulose as a carbon source for producing recombinant proteins or other high-value compounds.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory expression of recombinant small laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D. Yadav et al., Int J Biol Macromol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29203348>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This work reports for the first time the secretory expression of the small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in Pichia pastoris. Using an AOX1 promoter and alpha factor as a secretion signal, the recombinant P. pastoris harbouring the laccase gene (rSLAC) produced high titres of extracellular laccase (500+/-10U/l), which were further increased seven fold by pre-incubation at 80 degrees C for 30min. The enzyme ( approximately 38kDa) had an optimum activity at 80 degrees C, but optimum pH varied with substrate used. Km values for ABTS, SGZ and 2,6-DMP were 142.85muM, 10muM and 54.55muM and the corresponding kcat values were 60.6s(-1), 25.36s(-1) and 27.84s(-1), respectively. The t1/2 values of the rSLAC at 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C were 60h, 32h and 10h, respectively. The enzyme deactivation energy (Ed) was 117.275kJ/mol while DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS for thermal inactivation of the rSLAC were all positive. The rSLAC decolourised more than 90% of Brilliant Blue G and Trypan Blue dye in 6h without the addition of a mediator. High titres of SLAC expressed in P. pastoris enhances its potential for various industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Exploring three different expression systems for recombinant expression of globins: Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and Spodoptera frugiperda.</h4><p>A. Bracke, D. Hoogewijs, S. Dewilde, Anal Biochem 543 62 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29203135>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Globins are among the best investigated proteins in biological and medical sciences and represent a prime tool for the study of the evolution of genes and the structure-function relationship of proteins. Here, we explore the recombinant expression of globins in three different expression systems: Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and the baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda. We expressed two different human globin types in these three expression systems: I) the well-characterized neuroglobin and II) the uncharacterized, circular permutated globin domain of the large chimeric globin androglobin. It is clear from the literature that E.coli is the most used expression system for expression and purification of recombinant globins. However, the major disadvantage of E. coli is the formation of insoluble aggregates. We experienced that, for more complex multi-domain globins, like the chimeric globin androglobin, it is recommended to switch to a higher eukaryotic expression system.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression, purification and function of the extracellular domain of human RANK.</h4><p>Y.

In addition, this signaling pathway has also been shown to influence tumor progression as well as the development and function of the immune system. Therefore, blocking the interaction between RANKL and RANK is a new therapeutic approach to prevent bone-related diseases and cancer.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The coding sequence encoding the extracellular domain of human RANK (RANK-N) was codon optimized for Pichia pastoris and cloned into the pPIC9K vector, and the recombinant plasmid was then transformed into P. pastoris. The expression of RANK-N protein was confirmed using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain and western blotting. Recombinant RANK-N protein was purified by a multistep process including ultrafiltration (UF), Sephadex G-50 size-exclusion chromatography and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange chromatography, which resulted in a purity >95%. We found that the RANK-N protein can block RANKL-RANK signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, using a patient-derived xenograft of human colon cancer, we found that the recombinant RANK-N protein can inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The results show that a simple system to express and purify functional RANK-N protein has been developed. This work has thus laid a foundation for further research and clinical applications of RANK-N protein in treating bone-related diseases or even colorectal cancer.</p></details><hr><h4>[Preparation of isotope dilution mass spectrometry standards based on glucose pulse].</h4><p>W. Shu et al., Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao 33 1869 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202523>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) is the most accurate method for high-throughput detection of intracellular metabolite concentrations, and the key is getting the corresponding fully uniformly(U) (1)(3)C-labeled metabolites to be measured. The conventional procedure for getting fully U (1)(3)C-labeled metabolites is through batch cultivation, but intracellular metabolites concentrations by this method are generally low. By applying U (1)(3)C-labeled glucose pulse, combined with fast sampling and quenching, mixture of fully U (1)(3)C-labeled intracellular metabolites was successfully extracted with higher concentration from Pichia pastoris G/DSEL fed with fully U (1)(3)C-labeled glucose as only carbon source. Quantitative results from liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) show that concentrations of organic acids, sugar phosphates, amino acids and nucleotides were 2-10 folds higher than those without glucose pulse. Therefore, the glucose pulse method can efficiently improve the usage of fully U (1)(3)C-labeled glucose converting to (1)(3)C-labeled metabolites, and achieve the detection of intracellular metabolites with lower concentrate than the instrument detection limit.</p></details><hr><h4>Penicillium purpurogenum produces a novel endo-1,5-arabinanase, active on debranched arabinan, short arabinooligosaccharides and on the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl arabinofuranoside.</h4><p>F. Vilches et al., Carbohydr Res 455 106 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29197821>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Penicillium purpurogenum secretes numerous lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, including four arabinofuranosidases and an exo-arabinanase. In this work, the biochemical properties of an endo-arabinanase (ABN1) are presented. A gene, coding for a potential ABN was mined from the genome. It includes three introns. The cDNA is 975 bp long and codes for a mature protein of 324 residues. The cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The enzyme is active on debranched arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides. In contrast to other characterized ABNs, inactive on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside (pNPAra), ABN1 is active on this substrate. The enzyme has an optimal pH of 4.5 and an optimal temperature of 30-35 degrees C. Calcium does not activate ABN1. ABN1 belongs to GH family 43 sub-family 6, and a Clustal alignment with sequences of characterized fungal ABNs shows highest identity (54.6%) with an ABN from Aspergillus aculeatus. A three-dimensional model of ABN1 was constructed and the docking with pNPAra was compared with similar models of an enzyme very active on this substrate and another lacking activity, both from GH family 43. Differences in the number of hydrogen bonds between enzyme and substrate, and distance between the substrate and the catalytic residues may explain the differences in activity shown by these enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Dual-substrate inhibition kinetic studies for recombinant human interferon gamma producing Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A. A. Prabhu, V. Venkata Dasu, Prep Biochem Biotechnol 47 953 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29185908>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is considered as one of the prominent host extensively used as a platform for heterologous protein production. In the present study, the growth inhibition kinetics of recombinant P. pastoris expressing human interferon gamma was studied under different initial substrate concentrations of gluconate (10-100 g L(-1)) and methanol (2-50 g L(-1)) in modified FM22 medium. The highest specific growth rate of 0.0206 and 0.019 hr(-1) was observed at 60 g L(-1) of gluconate and 10 g L(-1) of methanol, respectively. Various three- and four-parametric Monod-variant models were chosen to analyze the inhibition kinetics. The model parameters as well as goodness of fit were estimated using nonlinear regression analysis. The three-parameter Haldane model was found to be best fit for both gluconate (R(2) = 0.95) and methanol substrate (R(2) = 0.96). The parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that micromax, Ki, and Ks are the most sensitive parameters for both methanol and gluconate. Different substrate inhibition models were fitted to the growth kinetic data and the additive form of double Webb model was found to be the best to explain the growth kinetics of recombinant P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Fused IgY Fc and Polysaccharide Adjuvant Enhanced the Immune Effect of the Recombinant VP2 and VP5 Subunits-A Prospect for Improvement of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Subunit Vaccine.</h4><p>H. Wang et al., Front Microbiol 8 2258 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29184548>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes damage in lymphoid organs and remains a threat to the poultry industry worldwide. Currently, subunit vaccines based on VP2 antigen expressed in prokaryotic systems are widely used in clinical settings. However, the immunogenicity of VP2 vaccines is limited because of their inherent defect that the structure of the antigen expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) may be different from its natural conformation. In this study, we fused VP2 and VP5 protective antigen genes and linked the chicken IgY Fc gene onto it. The eukaryotic expression plasmid carrying the fusion gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) to express the recombinant VP2-VP5-Fc protein. The recombinant protein was used as immunogen for evaluating immune response, and the recombinant VP2-Fc and VP2 proteins expressed in P. pastoris and the commercial VP2 subunit vaccines were used as controls. Moreover, Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), an immunomodulator found by our laboratory, was used as adjuvant to investigate its immune modulatory effects on immunogens. Chickens were divided into six groups and inoculated with VP2-VP5-Fc+TPPPS, VP2-VP5-Fc, VP2-Fc, VP2 vaccine, commercial VP2 subunit vaccine, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The recombinant VP2 subunit vaccine expressed in P. pastoris exhibited higher immunogenicity than the commercial VP2 subunit vaccine. The VP2-Fc protein showed a better effect than the VP2 protein, and the VP2-VP5-Fc subunit further improved the immune effects. In addition, TPPPS was proved to be a good immunopotentiator for the VP2-VP5-Fc subunit vaccine. Hence, the recombinant VP2-VP5-Fc subunit combined with TPPPS adjuvant exhibits potential as efficient IBDV vaccine to prevent infectious bursal disease.</p></details><hr><h4>Yeast Hog1 proteins are sequestered in stress granules under high-temperature stress.</h4><p>K. Shiraishi et al., J Cell Sci   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29183915>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The yeast high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway plays a central role in stress responses. It is activated by various stress stimuli including hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, high-temperature stress, and arsenite. Hog1, the critical MAP kinase of the pathway, localizes to the nucleus in response to high-osmolarity conditions, but otherwise little is known about its intracellular dynamics and regulation. Using the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii, we found that CbHog1-Venus formed intracellular dot structures after high-temperature stress, in a reversible manner. Microscopic observation revealed that CbHog1-mCherry was colocalized with CbPab1-Venus, a marker protein of stress granules (SGs). Hog1 homologs in Pichia pastoris and Schizosaccharomyces pombe also exhibited similar dot formation under high-temperature stress, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hog1 (ScHog1)-GFP did not. Analysis of CbHog1-Venus in C. boidinii revealed that a beta-sheet structure in the N-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for its localization to SGs. Physiological studies revealed that sequestration of activated Hog1 proteins in SGs was responsible for downregulation of Hog1 activity under high-temperature stress.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of carp gonadotropins: Structure, annual profile, and carp and zebrafish pituitary topographic organization.</h4><p>L. Hollander-Cohen et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29183794>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two gonadotropins, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), are important players in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of vertebrates. In the present work, we describe the construction of recombinant (r) common carp (Cyprinus carpio; c) FSH (rcFSH) and LH (rcLH) using the Pichia pastoris system, the generation of specific antibodies against their respective beta subunits, and their use in the development and validation of specific ELISAs. We produced carp rLH and rFSH as single-chain polypeptides, wherein the GTH subunit alpha was joined with either cLHbeta or cFSHbeta mature protein-coding sequences to form a fusion gene that encodes a yoked polypeptide, in which the GTH beta-subunit forms the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit forms the C-terminal part. Competitive ELISAs were developed, using primary antibodies against rcLHbeta or rcFSHbeta, respectively, and rcLHbetaalpha or rcFSHbetaalpha for the standard curves. The standard curves for cLH paralleled those of pituitary extracts of the homologous fish and also those of other cyprinids species like the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). We used the specific antibodies raised against cFSH and cLH to study the specific localization of the different GTH cells in the pituitary of carp and its taxonomic relative species - the zebrafish. Both FSH and LH cells are localized in the center of the proximal pars distalis enveloping both sides of the neurohypophysis. LH cells form a continuous population throughout the PPD, while FSH cells are more loosely distributed throughout the same area and form small aggregations. Marked annual changes were encountered in gonadosomatic index (GSI), follicle diameter, mRNA levels and protein levels of FSH and LH. From September to November, all fish had low GSI, and the ovary contained previtellogenic follicles. From December, the GSI level increased and remained high until March, the follicular diameter reached its maximum in January, where the ovary contained large fully grown follicles. Thereafter, spawning occurred through March and April and ended in May, and GSI level and follicle diameter increased again; and the ovary contained mid-vitellogenic follicles. LH pituitary content and mRNA levels were low at pre- and early vitellogenesis, increasing gradually during this process to reach a peak of LH mRNA levels in mid vitellogenic ovary and a peak of LH content in fully grown ovarian follicles. However, no significant change occurred in FSH pituitary content and mRNA levels in vitellogenic fish and in fish during final maturation stages. A dramatic difference was found in the total content of each gonadotropin in the pituitary, with higher LH than FSH. Moreover, follicle diameter was positively and significantly correlated with LH pituitary content and its transcript levels - but not with the pituitary content or mRNA levels of FSH. Taken together, these results indicate that in carp, LH alone is sufficient to regulate both vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation while FSH may have another, yet undefined role.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the Secretion Yield of the beta-Galactosidase Bgal1-3 in Pichia pastoris for Use as a Potential Catalyst in the Production of Prebiotic-Enriched Milk.</h4><p>L. Cao et al., J Agric Food Chem 65 10757 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29181978>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, three kinds of milk were treated with the beta-galactosidase Bgal1-3 (4 U/mL), resulting in 7.2-9.5 g/L galactooligosaccharides (GOS) at a lactose conversion of 90-95%. Then, Bgal1-3 was secreted from Pichia pastoris X33 under the direction of an alpha-factor signal peptide. After cultivation for 144 h in a flask culture with shaking, the extracellular activity of Bgal1-3 was 4.4 U/mL. Five more signal peptides (HFBI, apre, INU1A, MF4I, and W1) were employed to direct the secretion, giving rise to a more efficient signal peptide, W1 (11.2 U/mL). To further improve the secretion yield, recombinant strains harboring two copies of the bgal1-3 gene were constructed, improving the extracellular activity to 22.6 U/mL (about 440 mg/L). This study successfully constructed an engineered strain for the production of the beta-galactosidase Bgal1-3, which is a promising catalyst in the preparation of prebiotic-enriched milk.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of single-domain antibody in different systems.</h4><p>Y.

These VHHs possess unique structural and functional features, as they are small in size and exhibit thermal stability and high solubility. Compared to conventional antibodies, VHHs can be manufactured in microorganisms to significantly save on cost, labor, and time since VHHs lack the Fc domain with its N-linked oligosaccharide. Until now, VHHs have been expressed in several kinds of production systems, ranging from prokaryotic cells, yeasts, fungi, insect cells, and mammalian cell lines, to plants. In this review, we focus on the recent production of VHHs, introduce different platforms, and summarize the current state of this area and its future trends. Finally, the first potential VHH product, produced in Pichia pastoris, will probably be available on the market in 2018; thus, it is of great importance to give this antibody fragment timely attention. This is the first review concerning the production of VHHs in laboratory settings.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification of novel factors enhancing recombinant protein production in multi-copy Komagataella phaffii based on transcriptomic analysis of overexpression effects.</h4><p>X.

However, overexpression of recombinant protein often leads to severe burden on the physiology of K. phaffii and triggers cellular stress. To elucidate the global effect of protein overexpression, we set out to analyze the differential transcriptome of recombinant strains with 12 copies and a single copy of phospholipase A2 gene (PLA 2) from Streptomyces violaceoruber. Through GO, KEGG and heat map analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes, the results indicated that the 12-copy strain suffered heavy cellular stress. The genes involved in protein processing and stress response were significantly upregulated due to the burden of protein folding and secretion, while the genes in ribosome and DNA replication were significantly downregulated possibly contributing to the reduced cell growth rate under protein overexpression stress. Three most upregulated heat shock response genes (CPR6, FES1, and STI1) were co-overexpressed in K. phaffii and proved their positive effect on the secretion of reporter enzymes (PLA2 and prolyl endopeptidase) by increasing the production up to 1.41-fold, providing novel helper factors for rational engineering of K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>Fungal feruloyl esterases: Functional validation of genome mining based enzyme discovery including uncharacterized subfamilies.</h4><p>A.

FAEs as auxiliary enzymes significantly assist xylanolytic and pectinolytic enzymes in gaining access to their site of action during biomass saccharification for biofuel and biochemical production. A limited number of FAEs have been functionally characterized compared to over 1000 putative fungal FAEs that were recently predicted by similarity-based genome mining, which divided phylogenetically into different subfamilies (SFs). In this study, 27 putative and six characterized FAEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were selected and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant proteins biochemically characterized to validate the previous genome mining and phylogenetical grouping and to expand the information on activity of fungal FAEs. As a result, 20 enzymes were shown to possess FAE activity, being active towards pNP-ferulate and/or methyl hydroxycinnamate substrates, and covering 11 subfamilies. Most of the new FAEs showed activities comparable to those of previously characterized fungal FAEs.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of catalytically efficient xylanases from thermophilic fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea for synergistically enhancing hydrolysis of lignocellulosics.</h4><p>N.

The maximum level of xylanase expression was found to be 24.3U/ml for rXYN10A_MALCI and 573.32U/ml for rXYN11A_MALCI. The purified recombinant rXYN11A_MALCI was stable at 70 degrees C and catalytically active against a variety of substituted (arabinoxylans) as well as unsubstituted xylans. The hydrolytic potential of recombinant xylanases for enhancing the hydrolysis of acid/alkali pretreated lignocellulosics (rice straw and bagasse) by the commercial cellulase Cellic CTec2 was assessed which revealed that both rXYN10A_MALCI and rXYN11A_MALCI act synergistically with commercial cellulases and resulted in 1.54 and 1.58 folds improved hydrolysis of acid treated rice straw and alkali treated rice straw using cocktail comprising of Cellic CTec2 and XYN11A_MALCI (8:2 ratio) when compared to Cellic CTec2 alone at same protein loading rate of ( approximately 5.7mg/g biomass).</p></details><hr><h4>A novel tumor-activated ALA fusion protein for specific inhibition on the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231.</h4><p>X.

It will provide an effective approach for controlled release of the peptide toxins to treat cancerous cells.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> The ALA fusion proteins were expressed in pichia pastoris, and the recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The proteins were added to human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) in order to investigate the characteristic of selective targeting and releasing of scorpion toxin AGAP in cancer cells with high uPAR expression. The inhibitory effect of ALA on MDA-MB-231, MCF7, LO2 and HEK-293 was evaluated by MTT assay. Moreover, the antiproliferation mechanism of ALA was determined by flow cytometric and western blot analysis.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The results showed that ALA could target MDA-MB-231 cells and the scorpion toxin AGAP could be released with high efficiency and selectivity. ALA inhibited the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells MDA-MB231. Also, cell apoptosis pathway was found to be associated with the inhibition mechanism of ALA according to the data of flow cytometric and western blot analysis. Therefore, ALA could be a novel antitumor candidate for targeting treatment of malignant cell.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study successfully demonstrated that fusion of biotoxins with tumor target domain could provide a simple yet effective way to delivery of peptide or protein drugs.</p></details><hr><h4>Maturation and cytokine pattern of human dendritic cells in response to different yeasts.</h4><p>S.

This study systematically investigated the capacity of different biotechnically relevant yeast species and strains including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Candida glabrata to initiate maturation of human DC. As important prerequisite for T-cell activation, all yeasts were shown to effectively induce, though to a different extent, the expression of the activation marker CD83, the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, CD54, CD58, and CD40, as well as the antigen-presenting molecules MHCs I and II. Furthermore, yeast-activated DC secreted various cytokines including inflammatory TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta or T-cell polarizing IL-12, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-27. Variability was observed in the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in response to the tested yeasts, whereas expression levels of IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 were similar. Interestingly, maturation marker expression and cytokine secretion were not negatively affected after application of yeast mutants with altered cell wall mannoprotein structure (Deltamnn11) or defective in protein N-glycosylation (Deltaost3), indicating that elongated cell wall mannoproteins at the outer yeast cell surface are not a prerequisite for the observed yeast-mediated DC maturation. Thus, our data provide a valuable basic knowledge for the future design of effective yeast-based delivery approaches.</p></details><hr><h4>The Verticillium dahliae SnodProt1-Like Protein VdCP1 Contributes to Virulence and Triggers the Plant Immune System.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, an integrated proteomic analysis of secreted V. dahliae proteins was performed, and a conserved secretory protein, designated VdCP1, was identified as a member of the SnodProt1 phytotoxin family. An expression analysis of the vdcp1 gene revealed that the transcript is present in every condition studied and displays elevated expression throughout the infection process. To investigate the natural role of VdCP1 in V. dahliae, two vdcp1 knockout mutants and their complementation strains were generated. Bioassays of these mutants revealed no obvious phenotypic differences from the wild-type (WT) in terms of mycelial growth, conidial production or mycelial/spore morphology. However, compared with the WT, the vdcp1 knockout mutants displayed attenuated pathogenicity in cotton plants. Furthermore, treating plants with purified recombinant VdCP1 protein expressed in Pichia pastoris induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of several defense-related genes, leakage of ion electrolytes, enhancement of defense-related enzyme activity and production of salicylic acid. Moreover, VdCP1 conferred resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci in tobacco and to V. dahliae in cotton. Further research revealed that VdCP1 possesses chitin-binding properties and that the growth of vdcp1 knockout mutants was more affected by treatments with chitinase, indicating that VdCP1 could protect V. dahliae cell wall from enzymatic degradation, which suggests an effector role of VdCP1 in infecting hosts.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification, expression analysis, and antibacterial activity of NK-lysin from common carp Cyprinus carpio.</h4><p>G.

Nevertheless, the implication of NK-lysin in the protection against bacterial infection is not aware in common carp. In this study, six different NK-lysin genes (nkl1, nkl2, nkl3, nkl4, nkl5 and nkl6) were identified in the common carp genome. Each of the mature peptides of common carp NK-lysin has six well-conserved cysteine residues, and shares a Saposin B domain, characteristic of saposin-like protein (SALIP) family. The gene nkl1 contains 5 extrons and 4 introns, and nkl2, nkl3, nkl4 or nkl5 contains 4 extrons and 3 introns, however, the nkl6 has 3 extrons and 2 introns. By quantitative real-time PCR, nkl2 transcripts were predominantly expressed in spleen of healthy common carp, while elevated mainly in gill and spleen upon Aeromonas hydrophila infection. The recombinant NK-lysin-2 purified from Pichia pastoris shows antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli M15, Aeromonas hydrophila, as well as Edwardsiella tarda (Gram-negative), the latter two are important pathogens of aquaculture. Our results indicate that NK-lysin in common carp might play an important role in fish immune response by enhancing antibacterial defense against bacterial pathogens.</p></details><hr><h4>Fine-tuning the P. pastoris iMT1026 genome-scale metabolic model for improved prediction of growth on methanol or glycerol as sole carbon sources.</h4><p>M.

In the past recent years, important breakthroughs in the systems-level quantitative analysis of its physiology have been achieved. This wealth of information has allowed the development of genome-scale metabolic models, which make new approaches possible for host cell and bioprocess engineering. Nevertheless, the predictive accuracy of the previous consensus model required to be upgraded and validated with new experimental data sets for P. pastoris growing on glycerol or methanol as sole carbon sources, two of the most relevant substrates for this cell factory. In this study, we have characterized P. pastoris growing in chemostat cultures using glycerol or methanol as sole carbon sources over a wide range of growth rates, thereby providing physiological data on the effect of growth rate and culture conditions on biomass macromolecular and elemental composition. In addition, these data sets were used to improve the performance of the P. pastoris consensus genomic-scale metabolic model iMT1026. Thereupon, new experimentally determined bounds, including the representation of biomass composition for these growth conditions, have been incorporated. As a result, here, we present version 3 (v3.0) of the consensus P. pastoris genome-scale metabolic model as an update of the iMT1026 model. The v3.0 model was validated for growth on glycerol and methanol as sole carbon sources, demonstrating improved prediction capabilities over an extended substrate range including two biotechnologically relevant carbon sources.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and purification of plant fructan exohydrolases and their potential applications in fructose production.</h4><p>W.

Fructan can also be hydrolyzed by plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), but these enzymes have not been used to produce fructose commercially. Two Ht1-FEHs (Ht1-FEH I and Ht1-FEH II) were recently characterized in Jerusalem artichoke. In this study, we cloned the third member of the Ht1-FEH family in Jerusalem artichoke (i.e., Ht1-FEH III). When heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33, Ht1-FEH III not only demonstrated hydrolysis activity towards beta (2, 1)-linked fructans and beta (2, 6)-linked levan, but also towards sucrose. To explore the potential industrial applications, we heterologously expressed and purified six plant 1-FEHs from two typical fructan plants (i.e., chicory and Jerusalem artichoke) and showed that chicory Ci1-FEH IIa had the highest hydrolysis capacity to fructan in vitro. Furthermore, we immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa on resin and optimized the immobilization conditions. We found that inulin-type fructan or the tuber extract from Jerusalem artichoke could be rapidly degraded into fructose and sucrose by immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa. The capacity of Ci1-FEH IIa to release fructose from fructans was comparable to that of some inulinases from microorganisms. Thus, plant FEHs have potential applications in fructose production.</p></details><hr><h4>Overexpression of a Cellobiose-Glucose-Halotolerant Endoglucanase from Scytalidium thermophilum.</h4><p>L. P.

The gene encoding the endoglucanase from Scytalidium thermophilum (egst) was cloned and expressed as a soluble protein in Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant enzyme (Egst) was monomeric (66 kDa) and showed an estimated carbohydrate content of 53.3% (w/w). The optimum temperature and pH of catalysis were 60-70 degrees C and pH of 5.5, respectively. The enzyme was highly stable at pH 3.0-8.0 with a half-life in water of 100 min at 65 degrees C. The Egst presented good halotolerance, retaining 84.1 and 71.4% of the control activity in the presence of 0.5 and 2.0 mol L(-1) NaCl, respectively. Hydrolysis of medium viscosity carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) by Egst was stimulated 1.77-, 1.84-, 1.64-, and 1.8-fold by dithiothreitol, beta-mercaptoethanol, cysteine, and manganese at 10, 10, 10, and 5 mmol L(-1) concentration, respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed CMC with maximal velocity and an apparent affinity constant of 432.10 +/- 16.76 and 10.5 +/- 2.53 mg mL(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the Egst was tolerant to reaction products and able to act on pretreated fractions sugarcane bagasse demonstrating excellent properties for application in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>A streamlined cloning workflow minimising the time-to-strain pipeline for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

We have validated the workflow by cloning 24 human proteins of biopharmaceutical value, either as direct therapeutics or as research targets, which span a continuous range in size and GC content. This includes demonstrating the applicability of the workflow to three-part assemblies for a monoclonal antibody and its single-chain antibody fragments derivatives. This workflow should enable future research into recombinant protein production by P. pastoris and a synthetic biology approach to this industrial host.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression and characterization of a new lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and used for biodiesel production.</h4><p>W.

Pflip1, a new extracellular lipase gene from Pseudomonas. fluorescens Pf0-1, was first cloned and respectively expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris KM71, the recombinant proteins Pflip1a and Pflip1b were later purified separately. Then Pflip1a was further characterized. The optimum pH of Pflip1a was 8.0 and its optimal temperature was 70 degrees C. After incubation at 70 degrees C for 12 h, Pflip1a could retain over 95% of its original activity. It showed the highest activity towards p-nitrophenyl caprylate. Moreover, its activity was profoundly affected by metal ion, ionic surfactants and organic solvents. Furthermore, the two obtained recombinant lipases were immobilized on the magnetic nanoparticles for biodiesel preparation. The GC analysis showed that for the immobilized lipases Pflip1b and Pflip1a, the biodiesel yield within 24 h respectively attained 68.5% and 80.5% at 70 degrees C. The activities of the two immobilized lipases still remained 70% and 82% after 10 cycles of operations in non-solvent system. These characteristics and transesterification capacity of the recombinant protein indicated its great potential for organic synthesis, especially for biodiesel production.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and expression of complement component C8alpha, C8beta and C8gamma gene in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and C8alpha recombinant protein antibacterial activity analysis.</h4><p>G.

The cDNA sequences of the C8alpha, C8beta and C8gamma genes were cloned from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). Full-length cDNA of CsC8alpha (C8alpha of C. semilaevis), CsC8beta and CsC8gamma was 1990, 2219 and 886 bp, respectively, which contained open reading frames of 1797, 1749 and 666 bp, encoding 598, 582 and 221 amino acids, respectively. The deduced proteins of CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma showed the closest amino acid similarity to C8alpha (73%) of Siniperca chuatsi, C8beta (76%) of Oryzias latipes and C8gamma (72%) of Takifugu rubripes, respectively. The highest expression level of CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma among the 13 normal tissues was observed in liver tissue, followed by much lower levels in other tissues. After infection with Vibrio anguillarum, CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma were significantly up-regulated in all of the detected tissues, including the intestine, liver, gill, head kidney, blood and spleen. Then, a recombinant expression plasmid was constructed, and the recombinant CsC8alpha protein was expressed in GS115 pichia pastoris yeast. Furthermore, to investigate the biological functions of recombinant CsC8alpha, an antibacterial assay was performed, and the results showed that recombinant CsC8alpha obviously inhibited growth of V. anguillarum, Edwardsiella tarda and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Taken together, these results suggest that CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma may play important roles in the immune defense of C. semilaevis.</p></details><hr><h4>Sialic acid-binding lectins (SABLs) from Solen grandis function as PRRs ensuring immune recognition and bacterial clearance.</h4><p>X.

In present study, recombinant protein and antibodies of two SABLs from mollusk Solen grandis (SgSABL-1 and SgSABL-2) were prepared to investigate their functions in innate immunity. The recombinant protein of SgSABL-1 (rSgSABL-1) could bind LPS, PGN and beta-glucan in vitro, while rSgSABL-2 could only bind PGN rather than LPS and beta-glucan. Be coincident with their PAMPs recognition properties, rSgSABL-1 displayed a broad agglutination spectrum towards gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus, gram-negative bacteria Listonella anguillarum and fungi Pichia pastoris, and rSgSABL-2 only showed remarkable agglutinative effect on M. luteus and L. anguillarum. More importantly, after PAMPs recognition, rSgSABL-1 and rSgSABL-2 enhanced phagocytosis as well as encapsulation ability of hemocytes in vitro, and the enhanced encapsulation could be blocked by specific antibodies. All these results indicated that SgSABL-1 and SgSABL-2 functioned as two compensative pattern-recognition receptor (PRRs) with distinct recognition spectrum and involved in the innate immune response of S. grandis.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel, highly efficient beta-glucosidase with a cellulose-binding domain: characterization and properties of native and recombinant proteins.</h4><p>J. A. Mendez-Liter et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 256 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29142591>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Background: Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on earth, is an alternative for fossil fuels as a renewable feedstock for the production of second-generation biofuels and other chemicals. The discovery of novel, highly efficient beta-glucosidases remains as one of the major bottlenecks for cellulose degradation. In this context, the ascomycete Talaromyces amestolkiae, isolated from cereal samples, has been studied as a promising source for these enzymes. Results: BGL-2 is the major beta-glucosidase secreted by this fungus in the presence of cellulosic inductors. This enzyme possesses a CBD (Cellulose Binding Domain), an unusual feature among this type of proteins. Besides, when growing on cellulose, the fungus produced two different bgl-2 mRNAs that were cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. A complete recombinant protein (BGL-2*) and its truncated form, lacking CBD (BGL-2T*), have been purified, characterized and compared with the native enzyme (BGL-2). The three BGL-2 forms studied are highly stable in a wide pH range, but BGL-2T* showed an improved thermal stability at 50 degrees C after 72 h. Using p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside as a substrate, the steady-state kinetic characterization of the three proteins showed a similar Km and kcat for BGL-2 and BGL-2*, while the truncated protein displayed a threefold higher value for kcat . All tested BGL-2 enzymes were as well highly efficient using cellobiose and other short oligosaccharides as a substrate. In view of biotechnological applications, the recombinant T. amestolkiae enzymes in saccharification of brewers' spent grain were studied, being comparable to commercial beta-glucosidase cocktails. Conclusion: A new beta-glucosidase from T. amestolkiae has been studied. The enzyme, containing a functional CBD, has been expressed in P. pastoris. The comparative analyses of the native protein and its recombinant forms, with and without CBD, suggest that they could be suitable tools for valorization of lignocellulosic biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>Integrating metabolic modeling and population heterogeneity analysis into optimizing recombinant protein production by Komagataella (Pichia) pastoris.</h4><p>C.

This success story is linked to its specific physiological traits, i.e., the ability to grow at high cell density in inexpensive culture medium and to secrete proteins at high yield. Exploiting methanol metabolism is at the core of most P. pastoris-based processes but comes with its own challenges. Co-feeding cultures with glycerol/sorbitol and methanol is a promising approach, which can benefit from improved understanding and prediction of metabolic response. The development of profitable processes relies on the construction and selection of efficient producing strains from less efficient ones but also depends on the ability to master the bioreactor process itself. More specifically, how a bioreactor processes could be monitored and controlled to obtain high yield of production. In this review, new perspectives are detailed regarding a multi-faceted approach to recombinant protein production processes by P. pastoris; including gaining improved understanding of the metabolic pathways involved, accounting for variations in transcriptional and translational efficiency at the single cell level and efficient monitoring and control of methanol levels at the bioreactor level.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering strategies for enhanced production of protein and bio-products in Pichia pastoris: A review.</h4><p>Z.

To address the issues, strategies involving genetic and process engineering have been employed. Optimization of codon usage and gene dosage, as well as engineering of promoters, protein secretion pathways and methanol metabolic pathways have proved beneficial to innate protein expression levels. Large-scale production of proteins via high cell density fermentation additionally relies on the optimization of process parameters including methanol feed rate, induction temperature and specific growth rate. Recent progress related to the enhanced production of proteins in P. pastoris via various genetic engineering and cultivation strategies are reviewed. Insight into the regulation of the P. pastoris alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and the development of methanol-free systems are highlighted. Novel cultivation strategies such as mixed substrate feeding are discussed. Recent advances regarding substrate and product monitoring techniques are also summarized. Application of P. pastoris to the production of biodiesel and other value-added products via metabolic engineering are also reviewed. P. pastoris is becoming an indispensable platform through the use of these combined engineering strategies.</p></details><hr><h4>Antibacterial, antifungal and anticoagulant activities of chicken PLA2 group V expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A. Karray et al., Int J Biol Macromol 108 127 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129630>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Secretory class V phospholipase A2 (PLA2-V) has been shown to be involved in inflammatory processes in cellular studies, but the biochemical and physical properties of this important enzyme have been unclear. As a first step towards understanding the structure, function and regulation of this PLA2, we report the expression and characterization of PLA2-V from chicken (ChPLA2-V). The ChPLA2-V cDNA was synthesized from chicken heart polyA mRNA by RT-PCR, and an expression construct containing the PLA2 was established. After expression in Pichia pastoris cells, the active enzyme was purified. The purified ChPLA2-V protein was biochemically and physiologically characterized. The recombinant ChPLA2-V has an absolute requirement for Ca(2+) for enzymatic activity. The optimum pH for this enzyme is pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer with phosphatidylcholine as substrate. ChPLA2-V was found to display potent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bactericidal activity and antifungal activity in vitro. The purified enzyme ChPLA2-V with much stronger anticoagulant activity compared with the intestinal and pancreatic chicken PLA2-V was approximately 10 times more active. Chicken group V PLA2, like mammal one, may be considered as a future therapeutic agents against fungal and bacterial infections and as an anticoagulant agent.</p></details><hr><h4>Thermostability improvement of a Talaromyces leycettanus xylanase by rational protein engineering.</h4><p>X. Wang et al., Sci Rep 7 15287 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29127292>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Thermophilic xylanases with high catalytic efficiency are of great interest in the biofuel, food and feed industries. This study identified a GH11 xylanase gene, Tlxyn11B, in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802. Recombinant TlXyn11B produced in Pichia pastoris is distinguished by high specific activity (8259 +/- 32 U/mg with beechwood xylan as substrate) and excellent pH stability (from 1.0 to 10.5). The beechwood xylan hydrolysates consisted mainly of xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose, thus TlXyn11B could be used for the production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharide. By using the structure-based rational approach, the N-terminal sequence of TlXyn11B was modified for thermostability improvement. Mutants S3F and S3F/D35V/I/Q/M had elevated T m values of 60.01 to 67.84 degrees C, with S3F/D35I the greatest. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis revealed that the substituted F3 and I35 formed a sandwich structure with S45 and T47, which may enhance the overall structure rigidity with lowered RMSD values. This study verifies the efficiency of rational approach in thermostability improvement and provides a xylanase candidate of GH11 with great commercialization potential.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and purification of chimeric HBc virus-like particles carrying influenza virus LAH domain as vaccine candidates.</h4><p>A.

Interest is now focused on structurally conserved protein domains capable of eliciting protection against a broad range of influenza virus strains. The long alpha helix (LAH) is an attractive vaccine component since it is one of the most conserved influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stalk regions. For an improved immune response, the LAH domain from H3N2 strain has been incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) using recently developed tandem core technology.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Fermentation conditions for recombinant HBc-LAH were established in yeast Pichia pastoris and a rapid and efficient purification method for chimeric VLPs was developed to match the requirements for industrial scale-up. Purified VLPs induced strong antibody responses against both group 1 and group 2 HA proteins in mice.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Our results indicate that the tandem core technology is a useful tool for incorporation of highly hydrophobic LAH domain into HBc VLPs. Chimeric VLPs can be successfully produced in bioreactor using yeast expression system. Immunologic data indicate that HBc VLPs carrying the LAH antigen represent a promising universal influenza vaccine component.</p></details><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris Alcohol Oxidase 1 (AOX1) Core Promoter Engineering by High Resolution Systematic Mutagenesis.</h4><p>R. M. C. Portela et al., Biotechnol J   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29125227>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unravelling the core promoter sequence-function relationship is fundamental for engineering transcription initiation and thereby a feasible "tuning knob" for fine-tuning expression in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications. Here a systematic replacement studies of the core promoter and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the exceptionally strong and tightly methanol regulated Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter at unprecedented resolution is performed. Adjacent triplets of the 200 bp long core promoter are mutated at a time by changing the wild-type sequence into cytosine or adenine triplets, resulting in 130 variants that are cloned upstream of an eGFP reporter gene providing a library for expression fine-tuning. Mutations in the TATA box motif, regions downstream of the transcription start site or next to the start codon in the 5'UTR had a significant effect on the eGFP fluorescence. Surprisingly, mutations in most other regions are tolerated, indicating that yeast core promoters can show a high tolerance toward small mutations, supporting regulatory models of degenerate motifs, or redundant design. The authors exploited these neutral core promoter positions, not affecting expression, to introduce extrinsic sequence elements such as cloning sites (allowing targeted core promoter/5'UTR modifications) and bacterial promoters (applicable in multi host vectors).</p></details><hr><h4>Properties of two fungal endo-beta-1,3-galactanases and their synergistic action with an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase in degrading arabinogalactan-proteins.</h4><p>Y. Yoshimi et al., Carbohydr Res 453-454 26 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121496>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are plant proteoglycans, which are widely encountered in the plant kingdom, usually localized on the cell surface. The carbohydrate moieties of AGPs consist of beta-1,3-galactan main chains and beta-1,6-galactan side chains, to which other auxiliary sugars are attached. To date, FvEn3GAL isolated from Flammulina velutipes is the sole beta-1,3-galactanase acting on beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner. Here we cloned two homologous genes, designated Af3G and NcEn3GAL, possibly encoding endo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Aspergillus flavus and Neurospora crassa, respectively. The recombinant Af3G (rAf3G) and rNcEn3GAL expressed in Pichia pastoris specifically hydrolyzed beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner, as did the rFvEn3GAL. Among galactooligosaccharides, beta-1,3-galactotriose was identified as the smallest substrate for these enzymes. These results suggest that enzymatic characteristics are conserved in many endo-beta-1,3-galactanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 16 family. On the other hand, rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL generated more beta-1,3-galactobiose from beta-1,3-galactotetraose than did rFvEn3GAL, suggesting that rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL prefer hydrolyzing the central beta-1,3-glycosidic linkage of three in beta-1,3-galactotetraose. Although rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL alone hardly hydrolyze native AGP, they acted synergistically with a fungal exo-beta-1,3-galactanase on the AGP. These endo-beta-1,3-galactanases presumably aid hydrolysis by internally breaking up AGPs, which creates more sites of attack for exo-beta-1,3-galactanase.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient production and characterization of the novel and highly active antifungal protein AfpB from Penicillium digitatum.</h4><p>S. Garrigues et al., Sci Rep 7 14663 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29116156>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Filamentous fungi encode distinct antifungal proteins (AFPs) that offer great potential to develop new antifungals. Fungi are considered immune to their own AFPs as occurs in Penicillium chrysogenum, the producer of the well-known PAF. The Penicillium digitatum genome encodes only one afp gene (afpB), and the corresponding protein (AfpB) belongs to the class B phylogenetic cluster. Previous attempts to detect AfpB were not successful. In this work, immunodetection confirmed the absence of AfpB accumulation in wild type and previous recombinant constitutive P. digitatum strains. Biotechnological production and secretion of AfpB were achieved in P. digitatum with the use of a P. chrysogenum-based expression cassette and in the yeast Pichia pastoris with the alpha-factor signal peptide. Both strategies allowed proper protein folding, efficient production and single-step purification of AfpB from culture supernatants. AfpB showed antifungal activity higher than the P. chrysogenum PAF against the majority of the fungi tested, especially against Penicillium species and including P. digitatum, which was highly sensitive to the self-AfpB. Spectroscopic data suggest that native folding is not required for activity. AfpB also showed notable ability to withstand protease and thermal degradation and no haemolytic activity, making AfpB a promising candidate for the control of pathogenic fungi.</p></details><hr><h4>Fungal mannosylation enhances human papillomavirus 16 E7 therapeutic immunity against TC-1 tumors.</h4><p>Z. Wang et al., Oncol Rep 39 425 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115562>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cervical cancer, resulting from infection with human papillomavirus (HPV)16, remains the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. Recently, three prophylactic HPV vaccines targeting high-risk HPVs (particularly HPV16 and HPV18) have been implemented to protect younger women. However, individuals with pre-existing infections have no benefit from prophylactic vaccines. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic vaccines. HPV16 E7 has been widely utilized as a target for immune therapy of HPV16-associated lesions or cancers, reflecting the sustained existence of this virus in cancerous cells. We developed mannosylated HPV16 E7 (mE7) expressed from Pichia pastoris as a therapeutic vaccine against HPV16-associated cancer. Unmannosylated E7 (E7) was also generated from Pichia pastoris as a control. Mannosylation enhanced the uptake of mE7 by mannose receptors of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), while the uptake of E7 was unaffected. mE7-uptake BMDCs in vitro induced more IFN-gamma secretion by splenocytes of immunized mice than E7. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with mE7 combined with adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) elicited stronger Th1 (type 1 T helper cell) responses and E7-specific T cell responses than E7. The mE7 vaccine induced the increased production of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha, elicited more E7-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T cells in spleen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and promoted stronger E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses compared with E7. Furthermore, TC-1 tumor challenged mice were used to confirm the antitumor activity of the vaccines. As a result, mE7 generated complete antitumor activity against TC-1 tumors, while E7 only provided partial antitumor activity. Taken together, mE7 can be a promising immunotherapy for treating cervical cancer.</p></details><hr><h4>Combined effect of gene dosage and process optimization strategies on high-level production of recombinant human interleukin-3 (hIL-3) in Pichia pastoris fed-batch culture.</h4><p>V. K. Dagar, Y. P. Khasa, Int J Biol Macromol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113894>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, the combined effects of gene dosage and process optimization strategies were studied to achieve higher hIL-3 expression in Pichia system. The in-vitro multimerization method was used to generate various Pichia X-33 transformants having multi-copy expression cassettes. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) strategy was used to further confirm the genome integration of hIL-3 expression cassette. From shake flask expression studies, the recombinant hIL-3 concentration in culture supernatant increased upto 8 copies to a level of 310mg/L, thereafter a considerably lower expression was observed. The small scale optimization experiments at shake flask level resulted in an improved product concentration of 350mg/L. The batch and fed-batch fermentation runs in complex medium showed a product concentration of 1.81 and 1.49g/L, respectively. To further enhance the production level, the fermentation runs were conducted in modified minimal media where a maximum hIL-3 protein level of 2.23g/L was obtained in batch fermentation. The specific product yield (YP/X) was at a level of 25.65mg/g DCW, whereas the overall volumetric productivity of the process was 27.31mg/L/h. The biological activity of the partially purified hIL-3 protein was confirmed via the proliferation of human erythroleukemia TF-1 cells using MTT assay.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level heterologous production and Functional Secretion by recombinant Pichia pastoris of the shortest proline-rich antibacterial honeybee peptide Apidaecin.</h4><p>X. Chen et al., Sci Rep 7 14543 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109421>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Drug resistance is a major problem in antibacterial chemotherapy. Apidaecins, which refer to a series of small, proline-rich antimicrobial peptides, are predominantly active against many drug-resistant bacteria. The apidaecins have special antibacterial mechanisms, and are non-toxic for human cells, a prerequisite for using them as novel antibiotic drugs. However, no efficient non-tagged apidaecin expression system has been reported, which is the limiting factor for their application. Here we successfully generated a Pichia pastoris transformant expressing and secreting apidaecin. However, expression was unstable and poor. Analysis of this revealed that the integration plasmid was frequently lost and that apidaecin expression resulted in cell death. Using N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine mutagenesis and selection, a mutant strain Apmu4 was derived, in which the rate of loss of the integration plasmid was much lower after induction, and which produced improved titres of apidaecin. Additionally, we discovered that using glucose as the sole carbon source to pre-culture the strain before induction could greatly enhance apidaecin production. A pilot-scale 10 L fermentation yielded 418 mg/L of recombinant apidaecin, which represents the highest reported yield of apidaecin. Consequently, this study reports the first super heterologous expression and secretion of apidaecin in yeast.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimized expression of the Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase in Pichia pastoris through temperature adaptation, codon-optimization and co-expression with HAC1.</h4><p>S. De Waele et al., Protein Expr Purif 143 62 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108944>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase (SBLE) is a novel enzyme that, in vivo, catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of acidic sophorolipids in an aqueous environment. In fact, this is an unusual reaction given the unfavorable conditions for dehydration. This characteristic strongly contributes to the potential of SBLE to become a 'green' tool in industrial applications. Indeed, lactonization occurs normally in organic solvents, an application for which microbial lipases are increasingly used as biocatalysts. Previously, we described the production of recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). However, expression was not optimal to delve deeper into the enzyme's potential for industrial application. In the current study, we explored codon-optimization of the SBLE gene and we optimized the rSBLE expression protocol. Temperature reduction had the biggest impact followed by codon-optimization and co-expression of the HAC1 transcription factor. Combining these approaches, we achieved a 32-fold improvement of the yield during rSBLE production (from 0.75 mg/l to 24 mg/L culture) accompanied with a strong reduction of contaminants after affinity purification.</p></details><hr><h4>Furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural degradation using recombinant manganese peroxidase.</h4><p>K. L. Yee et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 108 59 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108628>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Biomass pretreatment-derived degradation compounds, such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF), inhibit the growth of fermentation microorganisms that utilize biomass to produce fuels and chemicals. Here we report that recombinant manganese peroxidase (rMnP) produced from the yeast Pichia pastoris can degrade furfural and HMF making them less toxic to microorganisms. Treatment with rMnP or manganese(III) acetate reduced furfural and HMF concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Furfural disappearance was accompanied by malonate disappearance and accumulation of four distinct degradation products. Furfural was more readily degraded by rMnP and manganese(III) acetate than HMF. Growth assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that rMnP treatment reduced the toxicity of furfural and HMF. This work provides an avenue to use rMnP to increase the growth of fermentation microorganisms that are inhibited by toxic compounds derived from pretreatment of biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel engineered interchain disulfide bond in the constant region enhances the thermostability of adalimumab Fab.</h4><p>H. Nakamura, N. Oda-Ueda, T. Ueda, T. Ohkuri, Biochem Biophys Res Commun   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097200>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We constructed a system for expressing the Fab of the therapeutic human monoclonal antibody adalimumab at a yield of 20 mg/L in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. To examine the contribution of interchain disulfide bonds to conformational stability, we prepared adalimumab Fab from which the interchain disulfide bond at the C-terminal region at both the CH1 and CL domains was deleted by substitution of Cys with Ala (FabDeltaSS). DSC measurements showed that the Tm values of FabDeltaSS were approximately 5 degrees C lower than those of wild-type Fab, suggesting that the interchain disulfide bond contributes to conformational thermostability. Using computer simulations, we designed a novel interchain disulfide bond outside the C-terminal region to increase the stability of FabDeltaSS. The resulting Fab (mutSS FabDeltaSS) had the mutations</p><p><strong> H:</strong>V177C and</p><p><strong> L:</strong>Q160C in FabDeltaSS, confirming the formation of the disulfide bond between CH1 and CL. The thermostability of mutSS FabDeltaSS was approximately 5 degrees C higher than that of FabDeltaSS. Therefore, the introduction of the designed interchain disulfide bond enhanced the thermostability of FabDeltaSS and mitigated the destabilization caused by partial reduction of the interchain disulfide bond at the C-terminal region, which occurs in site-specific modification such as PEGylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Integrated Bottom-Up and Top-Down Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for Characterization of Recombinant Human Growth Hormone Degradation Products.</h4><p>Y. A. Wang et al., Anal Chem 89 12771 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29096433>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>With the advent of biosimilars to the U.S. market, it is important to have better analytical tools to ensure product quality from batch to batch. In addition, the recent popularity of using a continuous process for production of biopharmaceuticals, the traditional bottom-up method, alone for product characterization and quality analysis is no longer sufficient. Bottom-up method requires large amounts of material for analysis and is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Additionally, in this analysis, digestion of the protein with enzymes such as trypsin could induce artifacts and modifications which would increase the complexity of the analysis. On the other hand, a top-down method requires a minimum amount of sample and allows for analysis of the intact protein mass and sequence generated from fragmentation within the instrument. However, fragmentation usually occurs at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein with less internal fragmentation. Herein, we combine the use of the complementary techniques, a top-down and bottom-up method, for the characterization of human growth hormone degradation products. Notably, our approach required small amounts of sample, which is a requirement due to the sample constraints of small scale manufacturing. Using this approach, we were able to characterize various protein variants, including post-translational modifications such as oxidation and deamidation, residual leader sequence, and proteolytic cleavage. Thus, we were able to highlight the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches, which achieved the characterization of a wide range of product variants in samples of human growth hormone secreted from Pichia pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcriptional analysis of impacts of glycerol transporter 1 on methanol and glycerol metabolism in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X. Li et al., FEMS Yeast Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29092019>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The efficient promoter of alcohol oxidase 1 (PAOX1) in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is strictly induced by methanol but repressed by glycerol with an unclear molecular mechanism. In the present study, the gene of a previously characterized transmembrane protein glycerol transporter 1 (GT1) of P. pastoris GS115 was deleted by homologous recombination. Transcriptional profiles of the mutant (gt1 big up tri, open) and wild-type (WT) were compared with different carbon sources (glycerol, methanol, and glycerol-methanol mix) at various time points using high-throughput RNA-Seq techniques. We determined that the loss of glycerol transporter 1 (Gt1p) could relieve catabolite repression in the glycerol-methanol mixed medium and shared a similar transcriptional profile with the WT in methanol medium. By calculating the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in three distinct paired groups, genes involved in the stress response, nutrition deprivation, and translational process were identified, explaining the potential roles of glycerol in the regulation of methanol metabolism. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), the relationship between biological traits and the transcriptional profile was established. With the support of published research and our data, we propose two possible regulatory pathways that are involved in the regulation of catabolite repression (AMPK/SNF1 and MAPK/HOG), thereby providing potential targets for both research and industrial strain improvement.</p></details><hr><h4>Expanding the CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit for Pichia pastoris with efficient donor integration and alternative resistance markers.</h4><p>A. Weninger et al., J Cell Biochem   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091307>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) is one of the most commonly used host systems for recombinant protein expression. Achieving targeted genetic modifications had been hindered by low frequencies of homologous recombination (HR). Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has been implemented for P. pastoris enabling gene knockouts based on indels (insertion, deletions) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at near 100% efficiency. However, specifically integrating homologous donor cassettes via HR for replacement studies had proven difficult resulting at most in approximately 20% correct integration using CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we demonstrate the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated integration of markerless donor cassettes at efficiencies approaching 100% using a ku70 deletion strain. The Ku70p is involved in NHEJ repair and lack of the protein appears to favor repair via HR near exclusively. While the absolute number of transformants in the Deltaku70 strain is reduced, virtually all surviving transformants showed correct integration. In the wildtype strain, markerless donor cassette integration was also improved up to 25-fold by placing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) on the donor cassette. Alternative strategies for improving donor cassette integration using a Cas9 nickase variant or reducing off targeting associated toxicity using a high fidelity Cas9 variant were so far not successful in our hands in P. pastoris. Furthermore we provide Cas9/gRNA expression plasmids with a Geneticin resistance marker which proved to be versatile tools for marker recycling. The reported CRSIPR-Cas9 tools can be applied for modifying existing production strains and also pave the way for markerless whole genome modification studies in P. pastoris.

The performance of Pichia pastoris as a host for transketolase whole-cell biocatalysis was investigated using a transketolase-overexpressing strain to catalyze formation of l-erythrulose from beta-hydroxypyruvic acid and glycolaldehyde substrates. Pichia pastoris transketolase coding sequence from the locus PAS_chr1-4_0150 was subcloned downstream of the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter in a plasmid for transformation of strain GS115, generating strain TK150. Whole and disrupted TK150 cells from shake flasks achieved 62% and 65% conversion, respectively, under optimal pH and methanol induction conditions. In a 300 muL reaction, TK150 samples from a 1L fed-batch fermentation achieved a maximum l-erythrulose space time yield (STY) of 46.58 g L(-1) h(-1) , specific activity of 155 U gCDW-1, product yield on substrate (Yp/s ) of 0.52 mol mol(-1) and product yield on catalyst (Yp/x ) of 2.23g gCDW-1. We have successfully exploited the rapid growth and high biomass characteristics of Pichia pastoris in whole cell biocatalysis. At high cell density, the engineered TK150 Pichia pastoris strain tolerated high concentrations of substrate and product to achieve high STY of the chiral sugar l-erythrulose.

Wang et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 8419 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29075828>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hydrophobins are a series of low molecular weight proteins produced by filamentous fungi that play an important role in fungal growth. They have a globular structure and possess a unique hydrophobic patch on their surface that makes them amphiphilic, making them among the most surface-active proteins. Herein, the surface charge properties of HGFI, a class I hydrophobin from Grifola frondosa, were altered by replacing the negatively charged Glu24 with a positively charged Lys to generate the ME24 mutant. Pichia pastoris GS115 was used for recombinant expression of the ME24 mutant, which was purified by a two-step procedure. The function of the mutated residue in HGFI self-assembly was investigated. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that the polarity of ME24 was enhanced compared with HGFI. Circular dichroism, thioflavin T assay, water contact angle and atomic force microscopy indicated that Glu24 participates in rodlet formation. Water solubility detection and dynamic light scattering showed that Glu24 affects the assembled state of HGFI in aqueous solution. The behaviour of the mutant in an emulsion, in the dispersion of insoluble materials and in large-scaled protein production suggests the functions of hydrophobins can be tuned for new applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Vaccine Containing the Three Allelic Variants of the Plasmodium vivax Circumsporozoite Antigen Induces Protection in Mice after Challenge with a Transgenic Rodent Malaria Parasite.</h4><p>A.

In the present study, recombinant proteins representing the PvCSP alleles (VK210, VK247, and P. vivax-like), as well as a hybrid polypeptide, named PvCSP-All epitopes, were generated. This hybrid containing the conserved C-terminal of the PvCSP and the three variant repeat domains in tandem were successfully produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. After purification and biochemical characterization, they were used for the experimental immunization of C57BL/6 mice in a vaccine formulation containing the adjuvant Poly(</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C). Immunization with a recombinant protein expressing all three different allelic forms in fusion elicited high IgG antibody titers reacting with all three different allelic variants of PvCSP. The antibodies targeted both the C-terminal and repeat domains of PvCSP and recognized the native protein on the surface of P. vivax sporozoites. More importantly, mice that received the vaccine formulation were protected after challenge with chimeric Plasmodium berghei sporozoites expressing CSP repeats of P. vivax sporozoites (Pb/PvVK210). Our results suggest that it is possible to elicit protective immunity against one of the most common PvCSP alleles using soluble recombinant proteins expressed by P. pastoris. These recombinant proteins are promising candidates for clinical trials aiming to develop a multiallele vaccine against P. vivax malaria.</p></details><hr><h4>Creation of stable heterothallic strains of Komagataella phaffii enables dissection of mating gene regulation.</h4><p>L.

Mattanovich, Mol Cell Biol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29061733>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) is homothallic and has been described to switch mating-type by an ancient inversion mechanism. Two mating-type (MAT) loci encode homologs of the MATa and MATalpha transcription factors, with the expression from one locus being downregulated by telomere position effects. However, not much is known about mating gene regulation since the mix of mating-types complicates detailed investigations. Within this study, we developed K. phaffii strains with stable mating-types by deletion of the inverted repeat region required for mating-type switching. These heterothallic strains retain their ability to mate with cells of opposite mating-type and were used to further elucidate mating gene regulation. Functional analysis of MAT mutant strains revealed the essential role of MATa2 and MATalpha1 in diploid cell formation. Disruption of MATa1 or MATalpha2 did not affect mating, however, in diploid cells both genes are required for sporulation and the repression of shmoo formation. The heterothallic strains generated in this study allowed the first detailed characterization of mating gene regulation in K. phaffii They will be a valuable tool for further studies investigating cell type specific behavior and will enable in-depth genetic analyses and strain hybridization in this industrially relevant yeast species.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel reverse micellar purification strategy for histidine tagged human interferon gamma (hIFN-gamma) protein from Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A.

The codon optimized hIFN-gamma gene was cloned in Pichia pastoris X-33 and the expression was evaluated in batch reactor study. The purification was carried out with modified nickel chelated reverse micellar system and compared with the existing Nickle- Nitrilotriacetic acid (NI-NTA) method. The parameter optimization for forward extraction demonstrated a significant enhancement of 72% in forward extraction efficiency (FEE). Furthermore, the factors governing back extraction efficiency (BEE) were also optimized with sequential optimization involving Taguchi orthogonal array and Artificial Neural Network linked Simulated Annealing Algorithm (ANN-SA). The optimization resulted in 91.2% back extraction efficiency of recombinant human interferon gamma (rhIFN-gamma). The development of this purification system with optimized parameters led to an efficient recovery of 67.3% and improved purity of 79.54%. Alongside, the anti-proliferative activity in MCF-7 cell lines were also investigated and it demonstrated that at 60ngmL(-1) concentration of rhIFN-gamma more that 25%.</p></details><hr><h4>Fungal glucuronoyl esterases: Genome mining based enzyme discovery and biochemical characterization.</h4><p>A.

Glucuronoyl esterases (4-O-methyl-glucuronoyl methylesterases, GEs) can cleave this ester bond, and therefore may play a significant role as auxiliary enzymes in biomass saccharification for the production of biofuels and biochemicals. GEs belong to a relatively new family of carbohydrate esterases (CE15) in the CAZy database (www.cazy.org), and so far around ten fungal GEs have been characterized. To explore additional GE enzymes, we used a genome mining strategy. BLAST analysis with characterized GEs against approximately 250 publicly accessible fungal genomes identified more than 150 putative fungal GEs, which were classified into eight phylogenetic sub-groups. To validate the genome mining strategy, 21 selected GEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. Of these enzymes, 18 were active against benzyl d-glucuronate demonstrating the suitability of our genome mining strategy for enzyme discovery.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of extracellular bacterial protein production in Pichia pastoris by co-expression of endoplasmic reticulum residing GroEL-GroES.</h4><p>P.

However, the potential productivity of this system can be limited. In this study, the Escherichia coli chaperones (GroES-GroEL) were expressed from the PGAP promoter and targeted to the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ability of the ER targeted chaperones to improve production of bacterial protein in P. pastoris was evaluated. The chaperones tagged with alpha-factor secretion- and ER retention-signal sequences were co-expressed with either extracellularly secreted phytase or intracellular d-phenylglycine aminotransferase (D-PhgAT) enzymes. The ER residing GroEL-GroES successfully increased the levels of active phytase extracellularly, 1.5-2.3-fold higher than the phytase expression alone, but did not enhance the formation of active, intracellular D-PhgAT. These results indicate that the chaperones have the potential to enhance production of active enzymes when present in the same trafficking pathway. This is the first report on the improvement of extracellular bacterial protein production through co-expression with ER residing bacterial chaperones in the Pichia system. The modified P. pastoris expression system may be beneficial for extracellular expression of other prokaryotic proteins.</p></details><hr><h4>The polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 enables normal growth under heat shock conditions in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Bonanomi et al., Sci Rep 7 13417 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29042637>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The protein ataxin-3 carries a polyglutamine stretch close to the C-terminus that triggers a neurodegenerative disease in humans when its length exceeds a critical threshold. A role as a transcriptional regulator but also as a ubiquitin hydrolase has been proposed for this protein. Here, we report that, when expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, full-length ataxin-3 enabled almost normal growth at 37 degrees C, well above the physiological optimum of 30 degrees C. The N-terminal Josephin domain (JD) was also effective but significantly less, whereas catalytically inactive JD was completely ineffective. Based on MudPIT proteomic analysis, we observed that the strain expressing full-length, functional ataxin-3 displayed persistent upregulation of enzymes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism during growth at 37 degrees C compared with the strain transformed with the empty vector. Concurrently, in the transformed strain intracellular ATP levels at 37 degrees C were even higher than normal ones at 30 degrees C. Elevated ATP was also paralleled by upregulation of enzymes involved in both protein biosynthesis and biosynthetic pathways, as well as of several stress-induced proteins. A similar pattern was observed when comparing a strain expressing JD with another expressing its catalytically inactive counterpart. We suggest that such effects mostly result from mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.</p></details><hr><h4>Cellobiohydrolase B of Aspergillus niger over-expressed in Pichia pastoris stimulates hydrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunches.</h4><p>J. S. Woon et al., PeerJ 5 e3909 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29038760>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Aspergillus niger, along with many other lignocellulolytic fungi, has been widely used as a commercial workhorse for cellulase production. A fungal cellulase system generally includes three major classes of enzymes i.e., beta-glucosidases, endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases. Cellobiohydrolases (CBH) are vital to the degradation of crystalline cellulose present in lignocellulosic biomass. However, A. niger naturally secretes low levels of CBH. Hence, recombinant production of A. niger CBH is desirable to increase CBH production yield and also to allow biochemical characterisation of the recombinant CBH from A. niger.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> In this study, the gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase B (cbhB) from A. niger ATCC 10574 was cloned and expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris X-33. The recombinant CBHB was purified and characterised to study its biochemical and kinetic characteristics. To evaluate the potential of CBHB in assisting biomass conversion, CBHB was supplemented into a commercial cellulase preparation (Cellic((R)) CTec2) and was used to hydrolyse oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), one of the most abundant lignocellulosic waste from the palm oil industry. To attain maximum saccharification, enzyme loadings were optimised by response surface methodology and the optimum point was validated experimentally. Hydrolysed OPEFB samples were analysed using attenuated total reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to screen for any compositional changes upon enzymatic treatment.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Recombinant CBHB was over-expressed as a hyperglycosylated protein attached to N-glycans. CBHB was enzymatically active towards soluble substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside (MUC), p-nitrophenyl-cellobioside (pNPC) and p-nitrophenyl-cellobiotrioside (pNPG3) but was not active towards crystalline substrates like Avicel((R)) and Sigmacell cellulose. Characterisation of purified CBHB using MUC as the model substrate revealed that optimum catalysis occurred at 50 degrees C and pH 4 but the enzyme was stable between pH 3 to 10 and 30 to 80 degrees C. Although CBHB on its own was unable to digest crystalline substrates, supplementation of CBHB (0.37%) with Cellic((R)) CTec2 (30%) increased saccharification of OPEFB by 27%. Compositional analyses of the treated OPEFB samples revealed that CBHB supplementation reduced peak intensities of both crystalline cellulose Ialpha and Ibeta in the treated OPEFB samples.</p><p><strong> DISCUSSION:</strong> Since CBHB alone was inactive against crystalline cellulose, these data suggested that it might work synergistically with other components of Cellic((R)) CTec2. CBHB supplements were desirable as they further increased hydrolysis of OPEFB when the performance of Cellic((R)) CTec2 was theoretically capped at an enzyme loading of 34% in this study. Hence, A. niger CBHB was identified as a potential supplementary enzyme for the enzymatic hydrolysis of OPEFB.</p></details><hr><h4>A New Yeast Peroxin, Pex36, a Functional Homolog of Mammalian PEX16, Functions in the ER-to-Peroxisome Traffic of Peroxisomal Membrane Proteins.</h4><p>J.

In mammals and yeast, several PMPs traffic via the ER in a Pex3- and Pex19-dependent manner. In Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) specifically, the indirect traffic of Pex2, but not of Pex11 or Pex17, depends on Pex3, but all PMPs tested for indirect trafficking require Pex19. In mammals, the indirect traffic of PMPs also requires PEX16, a protein that is absent in most yeast species. In this study, we isolated PEX36, a new gene in K. phaffii, which encodes a PMP. Pex36 is required for cell growth in conditions that require peroxisomes for the metabolism of certain carbon sources. This growth defect in cells lacking Pex36 can be rescued by the expression of human PEX16, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex34, or by overexpression of the endogenous K. phaffii Pex25. Pex36 is not an essential protein for peroxisome proliferation, but in the absence of the functionally redundant protein, Pex25, it becomes essential and less than 20% of these cells show import-incompetent, peroxisome-like structures (peroxisome remnants). In the absence of both proteins, peroxisome biogenesis and the intra-ER sorting of Pex2 and Pex11C are seriously impaired, likely by affecting Pex3 and Pex19 function.</p></details><hr><h4>Crude glycerol from biodiesel as a carbon source for production of a recombinant highly thermostable beta-mannanase by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Z.

The CQMa102 phosphatase was expressed in Pichia pastoris to verify its protease activity. The molecular weight (MW) and the isoelectric point (pI) of the phosphatase were about 85 kDa and 6.15, respectively. Substrate specificity evaluation showed that the purified enzyme exhibited high activity on O-phospho-L-tyrosine. At its optimal pH of 6.5 and optimum temperature of 70 degrees C, the protein showed the highest activity respectively.

In this study, a phytase of histidine acidic phosphatase (HAP) family was identified in Morchella importuna, a psychrophilic mushroom. The phytase showed 38% identity with Aspergillus niger PhyB, which was the closest hit. The M. importuna phytase was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. The phytase had an optimum temperature at 25 degrees C, which is the lowest among all the known phytases to our knowledge. The optimum pH (6.5) is higher than most of the known HAP phytases, which is fit for the weak acidic condition in fish gut. At the optimum pH and temperature, MiPhyA showed the maximum activity level (2384.6+/-90.4 mumol/min/mg), suggesting that the enzyme possesses a higher activity level over many known phytases at low temperatures. The phytate degrading efficacy was tested on three common feed materials (soybean meal/rapeseed meal/corn meal) and was compared with the well-known phytases of Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger. When using the same amount of activity units, MiPhyA could yield at least 3x inorganic phosphate than the two reference phytases. When using the same weight of protein, MiPhyA could yield at least 5x inorganic phosphate than the other two. Since it could degrade phytate in feed materials efficiently under low temperature and weak acidic conditions, which is common for aquacultural application, MiPhyA might be a promising candidate as a feed additive enzyme.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancing monellin production by Pichia pastoris at low cell induction concentration via effectively regulating methanol metabolism patterns and energy utilization efficiency.</h4><p>L.

The alternative strategy by initiating methanol induction at lower cells concentration was also reported to be effective in easing DO control, reducing toxic by-metabolites accumulation and increasing targeted proteins titers. However, the methanol/energy regulation mechanisms are seldom reported. We theoretically analyzed the methanol/energy metabolisms in protein expression process with the strategies of initiating induction at higher or lower cells concentrations, using monellin production as a prototype. When initiating induction at lower cells concentration and controlling induction temperature at 30 degrees C, monellin concentration reached the highest levels of 2.62~2.71 g/L, which was 2.5~4.9 fold of those obtained with the strategy of initiating induction at higher cells concentration. With the desired induction strategy, 1) carbon metabolism ratio directing into the precursors synthesis route for monellin production reached the highest level of 65%, carbon metabolism ratios towards to precursors synthesis and ATP regeneration routes were regulated at relatively balanced levels; 2) monellin synthesis was completely cell growth associated, with the largest associated coefficient and higher specific growth rate; 3) theoretical NADH (energy) utilization efficiency eta was the highest, and eta stayed high levels (>/=0.8) during most period (89%) within induction phase to supply sufficient energy in supporting monellin synthesis.</p></details><hr><h4>Synthesis of Isomalto-Oligosaccharides by Pichia pastoris Displaying the Aspergillus niger alpha-Glucosidase.</h4><p>N.

IMOs are a mixture that includes isomaltose (IG2), panose (P), and isomaltotriose (IG3). In this study, the IMOs were synthesized by a hydrolysis-transglycosylation reaction in an aqueous system of maltose. In a 2 mL reaction system, the IMOs were synthesized with a conversion rate of approximately 49% in 2 h when 30% maltose was utilized under optimal conditions by Pp-ANGL-GCW61. Additionally, the 0.5-L reaction system was conducted in a 2-L stirred reactor with a conversion rate of approximately 44% in 2 h. Moreover, the conversion rate was relatively stable after the whole-cell catalyst was reused three times. In conclusion, Pp-ANGL-GCW61 has a high reaction efficiency and operational stability, which makes it a powerful biocatalyst available for industrial scale synthesis.</p></details><hr><h4>Purification and function analysis of the Delta-17 fatty acid desaturase with or without transmembrane domain.</h4><p>H.

In the present study, a transgenic microorganism was used to clone the Delta-17 full length (Delta-17FL) and Delta-17 without transmembrane domain (Delta-17NT), the expression efficiency was improved and western blotting was used to detect the protein expression level. The purification of Delta-17 was precipitated using saturated ammonium sulfate solution, dissolved in phosphate buffered saline buffer, and then filtered using a 10 kDa ultrafiltration cube. Gas chromatography analysis was used to measure the effect of Delta-17NT or Delta-17FL expression on Pichia pastoris fatty acid composition. Furthermore, the function of Delta-17NT in HepG2 cells was measured and the mechanism was explored. It was demonstrated that Delta-17NT decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in vitro. In conclusion, successful expression of high levels of recombinant Delta-17NT represents a critical step towards the elucidation of the function of membrane fatty acid desaturases.</p></details><hr><h4>A Novel Vector for Construction of Markerless Multicopy Overexpression Transformants in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

Multicopy integration of the target gene is commonly used to improve the production of the target protein. Cre/lox recombination system is a powerful tool for the marker rescue during multiple integrations with one selection marker. Here we reported a novel expression vector based on the Cre/lox recombination system for multiple integrations of target gene to construct multicopy expression strain of P. pastoris. PAOX1 promoter was fused to cre to construct a methanol inducible Cre recombinase. The leakage expression of Cre recombinase in Escherichia coli was blocked by introducing the operator gene lacO. The expression vector designed pMCO-AOXalpha was stable in E. coli and could effectively rescue the Zeocin resistance gene for next round of integration in P. pastoris. Phytase AppA from E. coli was chosen as a reporter gene. Transformants with 2-16 copies of appA were constructed by using a single antibiotic. Expression of appA was gene dosage dependent when <12 copies were integrated. The protein yield increased 4.45-folds when 12 copies of appA were integrated comparing with the single copy integration. Our results showed that pMCO-AOXalpha was highly effective for rational construction of multicopy transformat in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel bifunctional acetyl xylan esterase/arabinofuranosidase from Penicillium chrysogenum P33 enhances enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose.</h4><p>Y.

The enzyme tolerates the presence of a wide range of metal ions. Sequence alignment revealed a GH62 domain exhibiting alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activity with pH and temperature optima of pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, in addition to the expected esterase domain. rPcAxe displayed significant synergy with a recombinant xylanase, with a degree of synergy of 1.35 for the hydrolysis of delignified corn stover.

Only 0.04 mg/mL enzyme could completely remove 0.15 mM malathion in aqueous solution within 20 min. Furthermore, 12 mumol malathion on apples and cucumbers surfaces was completely removed by 0.05 mg/mL PoOPHM9 in tap water after 35 min washing. The efficient production of the highly active PoOPHM9 has cleared a major barrier to biodegradation of pesticide residues in food industry.</p></details><hr><h4>New lipases by mining of Pleurotus ostreatus genome.</h4><p>A.

Since no biochemical or physiological data are available so far, a functional approach was applied to identify lipases from P. ostreatus. In the tested growth conditions, four lipases were found expressed, with different patterns depending on the used C source. Two of the four identified proteins (PleoLip241 and PleoLip369), expressed in both analysed conditions, were chosen for further studies, such as an in silico analysis and their molecular characterization. To overcome limits linked to native production, a recombinant expression approach in the yeast Pichia pastoris was applied. Different expression levels were obtained: PleoLip241 reached a maximum activity of 4000 U/L, whereas PleoLip369 reached a maximum activity of 700 U/L. Despite their sequence similarity, these enzymes exhibited different substrate specificity and diverse stability at pH, temperature, and presence of metals, detergents and organic solvents. The obtained data allowed classifying PleoLip241 as belonging to the "true lipase" family. Indeed, by phylogenetic analysis the two proteins fall in different clusters. PleoLip241 was used to remove the hydrophobic layer from wool surface in order to improve its dyeability. The encouraging results obtained with lipase treated wool led to forecast PleoLip241 applicability in this field.</p></details><hr><h4>Biological function of Dictyocaulus viviparus asparaginyl peptidase legumain-1 and its suitability as a vaccine target.</h4><p>J. Holzhausen et al., Parasitology  1 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942744>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The present study characterized the biological function of the asparaginyl peptidase legumain-1 (LEG-1) of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus and its suitability as a recombinant vaccine against dictyocaulosis. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed LEG-1 to be almost exclusively transcribed and expressed in parasitic lungworm stages. Immunohistochemistry localized the enzyme in the parasite's gut, which was confirmed by immunoblots detecting LEG-1 in the gut as well as male testes. LEG-1 was recombinantly (rLEG-1) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and subsequently analysed in activity assays for its enzyme functions and substrate specificity. For sufficient functionality, rLEG-1 needed trans-activation through D. viviparus cathepsin L-2, indicating a novel mechanism of legumain activation. After trans-activation, rLEG-1 worked best at pH 5.5 and 35-39 degrees C and cleaved a legumain-specific artificial substrate as well as the natural substrates bovine collagen types I and II. In a clinical vaccination trial, rLEG-1 did not protect against challenge infection. Results of in vitro characterization, transcription pattern and localization enhance the presumption that LEG-1 participates in digestion processes of D. viviparus. Since rLEG-1 needs trans-activation through a cathepsin, it is probably involved in an enzyme cascade and therefore remains interesting as a candidate in a multi-component vaccine.</p></details><hr><h4>Antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities of insect defensins-DLP2 and DLP4 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</h4><p>Z. Li et al., Sci Rep 7 12124 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935900>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are the most frequent cause of sepsis, which urgently demanding new drugs for treating infection. Two homologous insect CSalphabeta peptides-DLP2 and DLP4 from Hermetia illucens were firstly expressed in Pichia pastoris, with the yields of 873.5 and 801.3 mg/l, respectively. DLP2 and DLP4 displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria especially MRSA and had greater potency, faster killing, and a longer postantibiotic effect than vancomycin. A 30-d serial passage of MRSA in the presence of DLP2/DLP4 failed to produce resistant mutants. Macromolecular synthesis showed that DLP2/DLP4 inhibited multi-macromolecular synthesis especially for RNA. Flow cytometry and electron microscopy results showed that the cell cycle was arrested at R-phase; the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall were broken by DLP2/DLP4; mesosome-like structures were observed in MRSA. At the doses of 37.5 mg/kg DLP2 or DLP4, the survival of mice challenged with MRSA were 80100%. DLP2 and DLP4 reduced the bacterial translocation burden over 95% in spleen and kidneys; reduced serum pro-inflammatory cytokines levels; promoted anti-inflammatory cytokines levels; and ameliorated lung and spleen injury. These data suggest that DLP2 and DLP4 may be excellent candidates for novel antimicrobial peptides against staphylococcal infections.</p></details><hr><h4>Systems biotechnology for protein production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R.

Komagataella spp.) is one of the most important production systems for heterologous proteins. After the first genome sequences were published in 2009, tremendous effort was made to establish systems-level analytical methods. Methylotrophic lifestyle was one of the most thoroughly investigated topics, studied at the levels of transcriptome, proteome and metabolic flux. Also the responses of P. pastoris to environmental stress conditions experienced during high cell density production processes were studied. Metabolomics and flux analysis revealed the plasticity of the cellular metabolism in its adaption to the production of foreign proteins and served as blueprints for subsequent cell engineering and/or process design. The transcriptional response elicited by overexpression of heterologous proteins seems to depend on the nature and complexity of the recombinant product. Based on these data, novel targets for strain engineering could be deduced from transcriptomics and proteomics data mining and effectively enhanced protein secretion. Transcriptional regulation data also served as a valuable resource to identify novel promoters with the desired regulatory characteristics. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of systems biology applications in P. pastoris ranging from increased understanding of cell physiology to improving recombinant protein production in this cell factory.</p></details><hr><h4>Going native: Direct high throughput screening of secreted full-length IgG antibodies against cell membrane proteins.</h4><p>Y.

For example, phage and cell surface display benefit from exceptionally high throughput, but generally require high quality, soluble antigen target and necessitate the use of anchored antibody fragments. In contrast, the GMD-FACS assay can screen for soluble, secreted, full-length IgGs at rates of several thousand clones per second, and the technique enables direct screening against membrane protein targets in their native cellular context. In proof-of-concept experiments, rare anti-EGFR antibody clones were efficiently enriched from a 10,000-fold excess of anti-CCR5 clones in just three days. Looking forward, GMD-FACS has the potential to contribute to antibody discovery and engineering for difficult targets, such as ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of human S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase in vitro and identification of its potential inhibitors.</h4><p>W.

In this study, SAHH protein was successfully cloned and purified with optimized, Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) expression system.

Duan et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 223 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932264>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Butyl butyrate has been considered as a promising fuel source because it is a kind of natural ester which can be converted from renewable and sustainable lignocellulosic biomass. Compared with the conventional chemical methods for butyl butyrate production, the enzymatic approach has been demonstrated to be more attractive, mainly owing to the mild reaction conditions, high specificity, low energy consumption, and environmental friendliness. Cutinases play an important role in the butyl butyrate production process. However, the production level of cutinases is still relatively low. Thus, to identify novel cutinases suitable for butyl butyrate synthesis and enhance their yields is of great value in biofuel industry.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A novel cutinase gene (McCut) was cloned from a thermophilic fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The highest cutinase activity of 12, 536 U/mL was achieved in 5-L fermentor, which is by far the highest production for a cutinase. McCut was optimally active at pH 8.0 and 45 degrees C. It exhibited excellent stability within the pH range of 3.0-10.5 and up to 75 degrees C. The cutinase displayed broad substrate specificity with the highest activity towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate and tributyrin. It was capable of hydrolyzing cutin, polycaprolactone, and poly(butylene succinate). Moreover, McCut efficiently synthesized butyl butyrate with a maximum esterification efficiency of 96.9% at 4 h. The overall structure of McCut was resolved as a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. The structural differences between McCut and Aspergillus oryzae cutinase in groove and loop provide valuable information for redesign of McCut. These excellent features make it useful in biosynthesis and biodegradation fields.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A novel cutinase from M. cinnamomea was identified and characterized for the first time. High-level expression by P. pastoris is by far the highest for a cutinase. The enzyme exhibited excellent stability and high esterification efficiency for butyl butyrate production, which may make it a good candidate in biofuel and chemical industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of a fermentation process for the production of two PfAMA1-DiCo-based malaria vaccine candidates in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Kastilan et al., Sci Rep 7 11991 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931852>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a simple and powerful expression platform that has the ability to produce a wide variety of recombinant proteins, ranging from simple peptides to complex membrane proteins. A well-established fermentation strategy is available comprising three main phases: a batch phase, followed by a glycerol fed-batch phase that increases cell density, and finally an induction phase for product expression using methanol as the inducer. We previously used this three-phase strategy at the 15-L scale to express three different AMA1-DiCo-based malaria vaccine candidates to develop a vaccine cocktail. For two candidates, we switched to a two-phase strategy lacking the intermediate glycerol fed-batch phase. The new strategy not only provided a more convenient process flow but also achieved 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold higher space-time yields for the two candidates, respectively, and simultaneously reduced the final cell mass by a factor of 1.3, thus simplifying solid-liquid separation. This strategy also reduced the quantity of host cell proteins that remained to be separated from the two vaccine candidates (by 34% and 13%, respectively), thus reducing the effort required in the subsequent purification steps. Taken together, our new fermentation strategy increased the overall fermentation performance for the production of two different AMA1-DiCo-based vaccine candidates.</p></details><hr><h4>Role of induced glutathione-S-transferase from Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) HaGST-8 in detoxification of pesticides.</h4><p>C. P. Labade et al., Ecotoxicol Environ Saf 147 612 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923727>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The present study deals with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) based detoxification of pesticides in Helicoverpa armigera and its potential application in eliminating pesticides from the environment. Dietary exposure of a pesticide mixture (organophosphates - chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, pyrethroid - cypermethrin; 2-15ppm each) to H. armigera larvae resulted in a dose dependant up-regulation of GST activity and gene expression. A variant GST from H. armigera (HaGST-8) was isolated from larvae fed with 10ppm pesticide mixture and it was recombinantly expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris HaGST-8). HaGST-8 had a molecular mass of 29kDa and was most active at pH 9 at 30 degrees C. GC-MS and LC-HRMS analysis validated that HaGST-8 was effective in eliminating organophosphate type of pesticides and partially reduced the cypermethrin content (53%) from aqueous solutions. Unlike the untransformed yeast, P. pastoris HaGST-8 grew efficiently in media supplemented with pesticide mixtures (200 and 400ppm each pesticide) signifying the detoxification ability of HaGST-8. The amino acid sequence of HaGST-8 and the already reported sequence of HaGST-7 had just 2 mismatches. The studies on molecular interaction strengths revealed that HaGST-8 had stronger binding affinities with organophosphate, pyrethroid, organochloride, carbamate and neonicotinoid type of pesticides. The abilities of recombinant HaGST-8 to eliminate pesticides and P. pastoris HaGST-8 to grow profusely in the presence of high level of pesticide content can be applied for removal of such residues from food, water resources and bioremediation.</p></details><hr><h4>Evaluating Potential Risks of Food Allergy and Toxicity of Soy Leghemoglobin Expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Y.

The potential allergenicity and toxicity of LegHb and 17 Pichia host-proteins each representing >/=1% of total protein in production batches are evaluated by literature review, bioinformatics sequence comparisons to known allergens or toxins, and in vitro pepsin digestion.</p><p><strong> METHODS AND RESULTS:</strong> Literature searches found no evidence of allergenicity or toxicity for these proteins. There are no significant sequence matches of LegHb to known allergens or toxins. Eleven Pichia proteins have modest identity matches to minor environmental allergens and 13 Pichia proteins have significant matches to proteins from toxic sources. Yet the matched allergens and toxins have similar matches to proteins from the commonly consumed yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, without evidence of food allergy or toxicity. The demonstrated history of safe use indicates additional tests for allergenicity and toxicity are not needed. The LegHb and Pichia sp. proteins were rapidly digested by pepsin at pH 2.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> These results demonstrate that foods containing recombinant soy LegHb produced in Pichia sp. are unlikely to present an unacceptable risk of allergenicity or toxicity to consumers.</p></details><hr><h4>The yeast Geotrichum candidum encodes functional lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases.</h4><p>S.

Fungal LPMOs of the AA9 family target cellulose and hemicelluloses. AA9 LPMO-coding genes have been identified across a wide range of fungal saprotrophs (Ascomycotina, Basidiomycotina, etc.), but so far they have not been found in more basal lineages. Recent genome analysis of the yeast Geotrichum candidum (Saccharomycotina) revealed the presence of several LPMO genes, which belong to the AA9 family.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, three AA9 LPMOs from G. candidum were successfully produced and biochemically characterized. The use of native signal peptides was well suited to ensure correct processing and high recombinant production of GcLPMO9A, GcLPMO9B, and GcLPMO9C in Pichia pastoris. We show that GcLPMO9A and GcLPMO9B were both active on cellulose and xyloglucan, releasing a mixture of soluble C1- and C4-oxidized oligosaccharides from cellulose. All three enzymes disrupted cellulose fibers and significantly improved the saccharification of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass upon addition to a commercial cellulase cocktail.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The unique enzymatic arsenal of G. candidum compared to other yeasts could be beneficial for plant cell wall decomposition in a saprophytic or pathogenic context. From a biotechnological point of view, G. candidum LPMOs are promising candidates to further enhance enzyme cocktails used in biorefineries such as consolidated bioprocessing.</p></details><hr><h4>Quantification of the Intracellular Life Time of Water Molecules to Measure Transport Rates of Human Aquaglyceroporins.</h4><p>M. Palmgren et al., J Membr Biol 250 629 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28914342>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Orthodox aquaporins are transmembrane channel proteins that facilitate rapid diffusion of water, while aquaglyceroporins facilitate the diffusion of small uncharged molecules such as glycerol and arsenic trioxide. Aquaglyceroporins play important roles in human physiology, in particular for glycerol metabolism and arsenic detoxification. We have developed a unique system applying the strain of the yeast Pichia pastoris, where the endogenous aquaporins/aquaglyceroporins have been removed and human aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are recombinantly expressed enabling comparative permeability measurements between the expressed proteins. Using a newly established Nuclear Magnetic Resonance approach based on measurement of the intracellular life time of water, we propose that human aquaglyceroporins are poor facilitators of water and that the water transport efficiency is similar to that of passive diffusion across native cell membranes. This is distinctly different from glycerol and arsenic trioxide, where high glycerol transport efficiency was recorded.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and Characteristics of a Novel Xylose- and Alkali-tolerant GH 43 beta-xylosidase from Penicillium oxalicum for Promoting Hemicellulose Degradation.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, a novel intracellular glycoside hydrolase family 43 beta-xylosidase gene (xyl43) from Penicillium oxalicum 114-2 was successfully high-level overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and the secreted enzyme was characterized. The beta-xylosidase Xyl43 exhibited great pH stability and high catalytic activity in the range of pH 6.0 to 8.0, and high tolerance to xylose with the Ki value of 28.09 mM. The Xyl43 could effectively promote enzymatic degradation of different source of xylan and hemicellulose contained in alkaline-pretreated corn stover, and high conversion of xylan to xylose could be obtained.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel bi-directional promoter system allows tunable recombinant protein production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>V. Rajamanickam, K. Metzger, C. Schmid, O. Spadiut, Microb Cell Fact 16 152 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903770>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a well-studied host organism for recombinant protein production, which is usually regulated either by a constitutive promoter (e.g. promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGAP) or an inducible promoter (e.g. promoter of alcohol oxidase 1; PAOX1). Both promoter systems have several advantages and disadvantages; with one of the main disadvantages being their lack of tunability. Various novel promoter systems, which are either inducible or de-repressed, allowing higher degrees of freedom, have been reported. Recently, bi-directional promoter systems in P. pastoris with two promoter systems regulating recombinant expression of one or more genes were developed. In this study, we introduce a novel bi-directional promoter system combining a modified catalase promoter system (PDC; derepressible and inducible) and the traditional PAOX1, allowing tunable recombinant protein production.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We characterized a recombinant P. pastoris strain, carrying the novel bi-directional promoter system, during growth and production in three dynamic bioreactor cultivations. We cloned the model enzyme cellobiohydralase downstream of either promoter and applied different feeding strategies to determine the physiological boundaries of the strain. We succeeded in demonstrating tunability of recombinant protein production solely in response to the different feeding strategies and identified a mixed feed regime allowing highest productivity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this feasibility study, we present the first controlled bioreactor experiments with a recombinant P. pastoris strain carrying a novel bi-directional promotor combination of a catalase promoter variant (PDC) and the traditional PAOX1. We demonstrated that this bi-directional promoter system allows tunable recombinant protein expression only in response to the available C-sources. This bi-directional promoter system offers a high degree of freedom for bioprocess design and development, making bi-directional promoters in P. pastoris highly attractive for recombinant protein production.</p></details><hr><h4>COMPARATIVE PHYSIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF HYDROPHOBINS PRODUCED IN ESCHERICHIA COLI AND PICHIA PASTORIS.</h4><p>A.

Being amphiphilic, they spontaneously form layers that convert surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and vice versa. We have compared properties of the class II HFB4 and HFB7 from Trichoderma virens as produced in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Since the production in E. coli required denaturation/renaturation steps because of inclusion bodies, this treatment was also applied to HFBs produced and secreted in yeast. The protein yields for both systems were similar. Both HFBs produced by E. coli proved less active on PET compared to HFBs produced in P. pastoris. HFBs produced in E. coli decreased the hydrophilicity of glass the most, which correlated with the adsorption of a more dense protein layer on glass compared to HFBs produced in P. pastoris. The hydrophobins produced in P. pastoris formed highly structured monolayers. Layers of hydrophobins produced in E. coli were less prone to self-organization. Our data suggests that irrespective of the production host, the HFBs could be used in various applications that are based on their surface activity. However, the production host and the subsequent purification procedure will influence the stability of HFB layers. In the area of high-value biomedical devices and nanomaterials, where the formation of highly ordered protein monolayers is essential, our results point to P. pastoris as the preferred production host. Furthermore, the choice of an appropriate hydrophobin for a given application appears to be equally important.</p></details><hr><h4>Double promoter expression systems for recombinant protein production by industrial microorganisms.</h4><p>S. Ozturk, B. G. Ergun, P. Calik, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 7459 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28900685>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using double promoter expression systems is a promising approach to increase heterologous protein production. In this review, current double promoter expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins (r-proteins) by industrially important bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli; and yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, are discussed by assessing their potentials and drawbacks. Double promoter expression systems need to be designed to maintain a higher specific product formation rate within the production domain. While bacterial double promoter systems have been constructed as chimeric tandem promoters, yeast dual promoter systems have been developed as separate expression cassettes. To increase production and productivity, the optimal transcriptional activity should be justified either by simultaneously satisfying the requirements of both promoters, or by consecutively stimulating the changeover from one to another in a biphasic process or via successive-iterations. Thus, considering the dynamics of a fermentation process, double promoters can be classified according to their operational mechanisms, as: i) consecutively operating double promoter systems, and ii) simultaneously operating double promoter systems. Among these metabolic design strategies, extending the expression period with two promoters activated under different conditions, or enhancing the transcriptional activity with two promoters activated under similar conditions within the production domain, can be applied independently from the host. Novel studies with new insights, which aim a rational systematic design and construction of dual promoter expression vectors with tailored transcriptional activity, will empower r-protein production with enhanced production and productivity. Finally, the current state-of-the-art review emphasizes the advantages of double promoter systems along with the necessity for discovering new promoters for the development of more effective and adaptive processes to meet the increasing demand of r-protein industry.</p></details><hr><h4>Glycosylation is important for FcXTH1 activity as judged by its structural and biochemical characterization.</h4><p>A.

Previous studies suggest that XTHs might play a key role in ripening of Fragaria chiloensis fruit as FcXTH1 transcripts increase as fruit softens. FcXTH1 protein sequence contains a conserved N-glycosylation site adjacent to catalytic residues. The FcXTH1 structure was built through comparative modeling methodology, the structure displays a beta-jellyroll-type folding with a curvature generated by eight antiparallel beta-sheets that holds the catalytic motif that is oriented towards the central cavity of the protein. Through Molecular Dynamic Simulations (MDS) analyses the protein-ligand interactions of FcXTH1 were explored, finding a better interaction with xyloglucans than cellulose. Nevertheless, the stability of the protein-ligand complex depends on the glycosylation state of FcXTH1: better energy interactions were determined for the glycosylated protein. As a complement, the molecular cloning and heterologous expression of FcXTH1 in Pichia pastoris was performed, and the recombinant protein was active and displayed strict XET activity. A KM value of 17.0 muM was determined for xyloglucan oligomer. The deglycosylation of FcXTH1 by PNGase-F treatment affects its biochemical properties (increase KM and reduce kcat/KM ratio) and reduces its stability. As a conclusion, glycosylation of FcXTH1 is important for its biological function.</p></details><hr><h4>Recycling of a selectable marker with a self-excisable plasmid in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

However, with its multiple genetic modifications to solve bottlenecks for heterologous protein productivity, P. pastoris lacks selectable markers. Existing selectable marker recycling plasmids have drawbacks (e.g., slow growth and conditional lethality). Here, zeocin-resistance marker recycling vectors were constructed using the Cre/loxP recombination system. The vectors were used to (i) knock in heterologous phytase, xylanase and lipase expression cassettes, (ii) increase the phytase, xylanase and lipase gene copy number to 13, 5, and 5, respectively, with vector introduction and (iii) engineer the secretion pathway by co-overexpressing secretion helper factors (Sly1p and Sec1p) without introducing selectable markers, giving a phytase field of 0.833 g/L. The vectors allow selectable marker recycling and would be a useful tool to engineer P. pastoris for high heterologous protein productivity.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of stable and active human DNA topoisomerase I in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

First, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplification of the enzyme coding region was performed. The PCR fragment was cloned into pPICZ-alpha-A vector and sequenced. It was then transformed into X33, GS115, SMD1168H and KM71H strains of Pichia. PCR-screening for positive clones was performed, and estimation of multiple copy integrants in each Pichia strain was carried out using agar plates containing increasing concentrations of Zeocin((R)). The selected clones of multiple copy recombinant genes were then induced for TopoI expression in shaker flasks. GS115 and SMD1168 were found to be better Pichia strains to accommodate the recombinant gene for the expression of TopoI extracellularly. However, the DNA relaxation activity revealed that only the target enzyme in the culture supernatants of GS115-pPICZ-alpha-A-TopoI exhibited consistent enzyme activity over the cultivation time-points.

A. F. Blaha et al., Biotechnol Prog   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884522>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The time and cost benefits of miniaturized fermentation platforms can only be gained by employing complementary techniques facilitating high-throughput at small sample volumes. Microbial cell disruption is a major bottleneck in experimental throughput and is often restricted to large processing volumes. Moreover, for rigid yeast species, such as Pichia pastoris, no effective high-throughput disruption methods exist. The development of an automated, miniaturized, high-throughput, noncontact, scalable platform based on adaptive focused acoustics (AFA) to disrupt P. pastoris and recover intracellular heterologous protein is described. Augmented modes of AFA were established by investigating vessel designs and a novel enzymatic pretreatment step. Three different modes of AFA were studied and compared to the performance high-pressure homogenization. For each of these modes of cell disruption, response models were developed to account for five different performance criteria. Using multiple responses not only demonstrated that different operating parameters are required for different response optima, with highest product purity requiring suboptimal values for other criteria, but also allowed for AFA-based methods to mimic large-scale homogenization processes. These results demonstrate that AFA-mediated cell disruption can be used for a wide range of applications including buffer development, strain selection, fermentation process development, and whole bioprocess integration.

Li et al., 3 Biotech 7 291 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868218>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Human C-reactive protein (CRP), a classical human acute-phase plasma protein, is not only a sensitive systemic inflammatory marker but also an independent risk predictor of cardiovascular diseases. However, existing heterologous expression systems for expressing CRP is not efficient and cost-effective for large-scale industrial production of CRP to meet the growing market demand for CRP. This study aims to improve the secretion of recombinant CRP by Pichia pastoris via optimizing signal peptides, promoters and carbon sources. The CRP genes with encoding four different signal peptides were designed and synthesized. The genes were cloned into pPICZalphaA or pPICZ B, respectively via splicing by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR) technology and expressed in P. pastoris X-33, regulated by the alcohol oxidase I promoter (pAOX1). The CRP led by the alpha-mating factor secretion signal peptide (alpha-MF) was secreted at the highest level in these signal peptides. Then, a constitutive construct and expression of the CRP genes were achieved by switching to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (pGAP). Subsequently, different carbon sources and at different concentrations were used to further improve the secretion of CRP. The expression of CRP with the alpha-MF driven by the pGAP gave the highest yield of secreted CRP, about 3 mg/l of culture on the optimized culture conditions. The purified recombinant CRP exhibited good immunoreactivity determined by ELISA with anti-human CRP monoclonal antibody. The efficient engineering strategy established in this work might provide potential uses in large-scale industrial production of human CRP in the future.</p></details><hr><h4>Malachite Green and Crystal Violet Decolorization by Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus Supernatant and by rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B Concentrates: Molecular Docking Analysis.</h4><p>E.

Triphenylmethane dyes are synthetic compounds widely used in diverse industries. Their removal from effluents is difficult, due to their high degree of structural complexity; hence, their high concentration in effluents cause a negative impact on the environment. In the present work, molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between rGlLCC1 or rPOXA 1B enzymes with Crystal Violet (CV) or Malachite Green (MG) dyes. In addition, removal tests of the two dyes were performed. Van der Waals interactions were obtained for only the CV dye for both GlLCC1 and POXA 1B enzymes. Nevertheless, in the GlLCC1 model, two pi-pi interactions were observed. For the MG dye only, Van der Waals interactions were obtained. Moreover, amino acid composition interacting in each model with each dye was similar. It is important to highlight that by molecular docking, none of the estimated ligand configurations generated hydrogen bonds. Thus, explaining the difficulty to degrade CV and MG. Regarding CV, maximum decolorization percentage was 23.6 +/- 1.0% using Ganoderma lucidum supernatant and 5.0 +/- 0.5% with Pleurotus ostreatus supernatant. When using recombinant laccase enzyme concentrates, decolorization percentages were 9.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.5 +/- 1.0% for rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B, respectively. On the other hand, for the MG dye, maximum decolorization percentages were 52.1 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2% using G. lucidum and P. ostreatus concentrates, respectively. Whereas with recombinant laccase enzymatic concentrates, values of 9.4 +/- 0.8% were obtained, with rGlLCC1, and 2.1 +/- 0.1% when using rPOXA 1B. These findings represent an important step in bioremediation processes improvement and efficiency of industry-generated products, using environmentally friendly alternatives.</p></details><hr><h4>Development of a general defined medium for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

More than 500 proteins have been expressed in the organism at a variety of cultivation scales, from small shake flasks to large bioreactors. Large-scale fermentation strategies typically employ chemically defined growth medium because of its greater batch-to-batch consistency and in many cases, lower costs compared to complex medium. For biopharmaceuticals, defined growth medium may also simplify downstream purification and regulatory documentation. Standard formulations of defined media for P. pastoris are minimal ones that lack the metabolic intermediates provided by complex components such as peptone and yeast extract. As a result, growth rates and per-cell productivities are significantly lower than in complex medium. We have designed a rich defined medium (RDM) for Pichia pastoris by systematically evaluating nutrients of increasing complexity and identifying those that are most critical for growth. We have also employed transcriptomics to gain deeper insights into the underlying metabolic processes and inform our media design. We have demonstrated that using RDM for expression of three heterologous proteins yields titers comparable to, or higher than, those in standard complex medium. RDM improves productivity of P. pastoris fermentations and its development demonstrates the usefulness of transcriptomics to accelerate process development for new molecules.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant neuritin affects the senescence, apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</h4><p>W.

We previously isolated the cDNA that codes for a laccase isozyme (Lac2a) from the medicinal mushroom Agaricus brasiliensis (Matsumoto-Akanuma et al., Int. J. Med. Mushrooms, 16, 375-393, 2014). In this study, we first attempted heterologous expression of the wild-type laccase using a Pichia pastoris secretory expression system. However, the trial was unsuccessful most likely because the enzyme was too unstable and degraded immediately after production. Therefore, we improved the stability of the laccase by using a phylogeny-based design method. We created a mutant laccase in which sixteen original residues were replaced with those found in the phylogenetically inferred ancestral sequence. The resulting mutant protein was successfully produced using the P. pastoris secretory expression system and then purified. The designed laccase showed catalytic properties similar to those of other fungal laccases. Moreover, the laccase is highly thermally stable at acidic and neutral pH and is also stable at alkaline pH at moderate temperatures. We expect that the laccase will serve as a useful tool for enzymatic polymerization of di-phenolic compounds.</p></details><hr><h4>Active Expression of Human Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) c-DNA from Pulmonary Metastases in the Methylotrophic Yeast Pichia Pastoris KM71H Strain</h4><p>A.

It catalyzes the activation of zymogen plasminogen to the fibrin-degrading proteinase, plasmin, leading to digestion of fibrin clots. The recombinant enzyme produced by recombinant technology issued to dissolve blood clots in treatment of various human diseases such as coronary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Pichia pastoris expression system is a unique system for the production of high level of recombinant proteins. GS115 and KM71H are two kinds of Pichia pastoris strains whilst production of recombinant proteins in these strains is not predictable. The aim of the study was evaluation of t-PA expression in KM71H strains. Methods: In this study, the cDNA of the t-PA gene was amplified by PCR, sequenced and cloned into Pichia pastoris KM71H host strain using pPICZalphaA expression vector that allows methanol-induced expression and secretion of the protein. Results: Dot blotting results confirmed the presence oft-PA in the cell supernatant. Western blotting test revealed the approximate size of 70 KDa for recombinant t-PA. Quantitative ELISA experiment showed 810 mug/L of t-PA in the supernatant samples. Zymography analysis confirmed the proteolytic activity and biological function of the expressed recombinant t-PA. Conclusions: Correspondingly, Pichia pastoris KM71H is an appropriate strain for production of active recombinant protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and expression of the recombinant crustacean hyperglycemic hormone isoform B2 (rCHH-B2) and its effects on the metabolism and osmoregulation of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.</h4><p>L. Camacho-Jimenez et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol 253 33 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28842215>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Crustacean hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs) are multifunctional neuropeptides ubiquitous in crustaceans. In Litopenaeus vannamei, CHH-B2 is a CHH eyestalk isoform whose expression has been shown to vary with enviromental conditions, suggesting its relevance for ecophysiological performance of shrimp, controlling processes related to metabolism and osmo-ionic regulation. To study the involvement of CHH-B2 in these processes, we cloned and expressed a recombinant version with a free C-terminal glycine (rCHH-B2-Gly) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The rCHH-B2-Gly peptide secreted to the culture medium was purified by RP-HPLC and used for in vivo glucose, triglyceride, and osmoregulation dose-response analyses with juvenile shrimp. The peptide was also amidated at the C-terminus using an alpha-amidating enzyme to produce rCHH-B2-amide. The shrimp showed a dose-dependent effect of rCHH-B2-Gly to hemolymph glucose and triglyceride levels, inducing maximal increases by injecting 500 and 1000pmol of hormone, respectively. Additionally, 10pmol of hormone was sufficient to reduce the hypo-osmoregulatory capacity of shrimp at 35 per thousand. These findings suggest that CHH-B2 has regulatory roles in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and a potential involvement in osmoregulation of L. vannamei. Injection of 100pmol of rCHH-B2-amide increased glucose and triglyceride levels by 15 and 28%, respectively in comparison with rCHH-B2-Gly, suggesting an important role for the C-terminal amidation. Additionally, an in silico structural analysis done with the CHH-B1 and rCHH-B2-Gly peptides suggests that the C-terminal region may be relevant for the activity of the L. vannamei isoforms and explain the functional divergence from other crustacean CHH/CHH-like peptides.</p></details><hr><h4>A new type of gene-disruption cassette with a rescue gene for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>T.

However, the efficiency of mutant isolation by gene-targeting is usually low and the procedure is difficult for those inexperienced in yeast genetics. In order to overcome these issues, we developed a new gene-disruption system with a rescue gene using an inducible Cre/mutant-loxP system. With only short homology regions, the gene-disruption cassette of the system replaces its target-gene locus containing a mutation with a compensatory rescue gene. As the cassette contains the AOX1 promoter-driven Cre gene, when targeted strains are grown on media containing methanol, the DNA fragment, i.e., the marker, rescue and Cre genes, between the mutant-loxP sequences in the cassette is excised, leaving only the remaining mutant-loxP sequence in the genome, and consequently a target gene-disrupted mutant can be isolated. The system was initially validated on ADE2 gene disruption, where the disruption can easily be detected by color-change of the colonies. Then, the system was applied for knocking-out URA3 and OCH1 genes, reported to be difficult to accomplish by conventional gene-targeting methods. All three gene-disruption cassettes with their rescue genes replaced their target genes, and the Cre/mutant-loxP system worked well to successfully isolate their knock-out mutants. This study identified a new gene-disruption system that could be used to effectively and strategically knock out genes of interest, especially whose deletion is detrimental to growth, without using special strains, e.g., deficient in nonhomologous end-joining, in P. pastoris.

The specific detection of allergy to the venom of this wasp is often hampered by the lack of recombinant allergens currently available for molecular diagnosis. Antigen 5 (~23 kDa) from P. paulista venom (Poly p 5) is a highly abundant and glycosylated allergenic protein that could be used for development of component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Here, we describe the cloning and heterologous expression of the antigen 5 (rPoly p 5) from P. paulista venom using the eukaryotic system Pichia pastoris. The expression as a secreted protein yielded high levels of soluble rPoly p 5. The recombinant allergen was further purified to homogeneity (99%) using a two-step chromatographic procedure. Simultaneously, the native form of the allergen (nPoly p 5) was purified from the wasp venom by Ion exchange chromatography. The rPoly p 5 and nPoly p 5 were then submitted to a comparative analysis of IgE-mediated immunodetection using sera from patients previously diagnosed with sensitization to wasp venoms. Both rPoly p 5 and nPoly p 5 were recognized by specific IgE (sIgE) in the sera of the allergic individuals. The high levels of identity found between nPoly p 5 and rPoly p 5 by the alignment of its primary sequences as well as by 3-D models support the results obtained in the immunoblot. Overall, we showed that P. pastoris is a suitable system for production of soluble rPoly p 5 and that the recombinant allergen represents a potential candidate for molecular diagnosis of P.paulista venom allergy.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the catalytic characteristics of lipase-displaying yeast cells by hydrophobic modification.</h4><p>K.

However, the hydrophilic characteristics of the yeast cell surface may impede efficient immobilisation. Herein, we tested three methods to enhance the hydrophobicity of the surface of Candida antarctica lipase B-displaying Pichia pastoris cells, co-displaying a fungal hydrophobin, coating with ionic liquids, and adding decane as a hydrophobic carbon source during fermentation. Modified cells showed higher surface hydrophobicity and superior esterification of C6-C18 saturated fatty acids in hydrophobic solvents. When used for biodiesel synthesis, modified cells exhibited an improved initial reaction rate and equilibrium fatty acid methyl ester yield. We systematically discuss the influence of cell surface hydrophobicity on the catalytic properties, and the results provide guidance for improving the catalytic efficiency and operational characteristics of lipase-displaying yeast cells for organic bioconversions.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of the antimicrobial peptide ABP-dHC-cecropin A in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

The SacI-linearized plasmid pPICZalphaA-ABP-dHC-cecropin A was then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation. Expression was induced after a 96-h incubation with 0.5% methanol at 20 degrees C in a culture supplied with 2% casamino acids to avoid proteolysis. Under these conditions, approximately 48 mg of ABP-dHC-cecropin A was secreted into 1L (4 x 250-mL)of medium. Recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was purified using size-exclusion chromatography, and 21 mg of pure active ABP-dHC-cecropin A was obtained from 1L (4 x 250-mL)of culture. Electrophoresis on 4-20% gradient gels indicated that recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was secreted as a protein approximately 4 kDa in size. Recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was successfully expressed, as the product displayed antibacterial and antifungal activities (based on an antibacterial assay, scanning electron microscopy, and antifungal assay) indistinguishable from those of the synthesized protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural Insights into the Mode of Action of the Peptide Antibiotic Copsin.</h4><p>M.

Because of their unique mode of action and rapid killing of pathogenic microbes, defensins are considered promising alternatives to clinically applied antibiotics. Copsin is a defensin-like peptide, previously identified in the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea. It exerts its activity against a range of Gram-positive bacteria by binding to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and prevention of proper cell wall formation. In this study, we present a new workflow for the generation, production, and activity-driven selection of copsin derivatives, based on their expression in Pichia pastoris. One hundred fifty-two single-amino acid mutants and combinations thereof allowed the identification of k-copsin, a peptide variant exhibiting significantly enhanced activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, we performed in silico characterizations of membrane interactions of copsin and k-copsin, in the presence and absence of lipid II. The molecular dynamics data highlighted a high variability in lipid II binding, with a preference for the MurNAc moiety with 47 and 35% of the total contacts for copsin and k-copsin, respectively. Mutated amino acids were located in loop regions of k-copsin and shown to be crucial in the perturbation of the bacterial membrane. These structural studies provide a better understanding of how defensins can be developed toward antibacterial therapies less prone to resistance issues.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative analysis of the effect of protein Z4 from barley malt and recombinant Pichia pastoris on beer foam stability: Role of N-glycosylation and glycation.</h4><p>C.

The malt protein Z4 and recombinant protein Z4 showed similar N-glycosylation patterns while recombinant protein Z4 was glycosylated at a higher degree. In the simulated mashing and boiling, malt protein Z4 and deglycosylated malt protein Z4 preferred to glycate with glucose and maltose while recombinant protein Z4 and deglycosylated recombinant protein Z4 showed preference towards fructose. The addition of protein Z4 and protein Z4-saccharide complexes in finished beer showed that the addition of glycosylated protein Z4 only slightly enhanced the beer foam stability while the addition of glycated protein Z4 and protein Z4 with both glycation and glycosylation could significantly increase the beer foam stability. Therefore, glycation instead of N-glycosylation of protein Z4 played important roles in maintaining beer foam stability.</p></details><hr><h4>The heterologous expression strategies of antimicrobial peptides in microbial systems.</h4><p>T.

Compared to traditional antibiotics, AMPs are more stable and have lower propensity for developing resistance through functioning in the innate immune system, thus having important applications in the fields of medicine, food and so on. However, despite of their high economic values, the low yield and the cumbersome extraction process in AMPs production are problems that limit their industrial application and scientific research. To conquer these obstacles, optimized heterologous expression technologies were developed that could provide effective ways to increase the yield of AMPs. In this review, the research progress on heterologous expression of AMPs using Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as host cells was mainly summarized, which might guide the expression strategies of AMPs in these cells.</p></details><hr><h4>The Magnaporthe oryzae Alt A 1-like protein MoHrip1 binds to the plant plasma membrane.</h4><p>Y.

To determine the location of MoHrip1 in M. oryzae, a mohrip1-gfp mutant was generated. Fluorescence microscopy observations and western blotting analysis showed that MoHrip1 was both present in the secretome and abundant in the fungal cell wall. To obtain MoHrip1 protein, we carried out high-yield expression of MoHrip1 in Pichia pastoris. Treatment of tobacco plants with MoHrip1 induced the formation of necrosis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and expression of several defense-related genes, as well as conferred disease resistance. By fusion to green fluorescent protein, we showed that MoHrip1 was able to bind to the tobacco and rice plant plasma membrane, causing rapid morphological changes at the cellular level, such as cell shrinkage and chloroplast disorganization. These findings indicate that MoHrip1 is a microbe-associated molecular pattern that is perceived by the plant immune system. This is the first study on an AA1 family protein that can bind to the plant plasma membrane.</p></details><hr><h4>The versatile functions of LRR-only proteins in mollusk Chlamys farreri.</h4><p>M.

In the present study, three novel LRR-only proteins, CfLRRop-4, CfLRRop-5 and CfLRRop-6, were identified and characterized from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. They all contained LRR motifs with consensus signature sequences of LxxLxLxxNxL or LxxLxLxxCxxL. All the mRNA transcripts of three CfLRRops were high abundant in hepatopancreas, gills and gonads, and their mRNA transcripts in hemocytes could respond to the stimulations of different microbes, including Vibrio anguillarum, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. These three CfLRRops exhibited similar ligand binding and recognition characteristics as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). The immune effectors, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, superoxide dismutase, catalase and lysozyme, varied significantly after the scallops were stimulated by recombinant LRR-only proteins. All these results indicated that LRR-only proteins are functionally differentiated and exhibit different immunomodulation activities on various downstream immune effectors.</p></details><hr><h4>UBX domain-containing proteins are involved in lipid homeostasis and stress responses in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

UBX proteins can bind to the N-terminal region of Cdc48 to perform endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this study, we identified two UBX domain-containing proteins, Ubx1 and Ubx2, in Pichia pastoris and found that the two proteins could recover the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in ubx2Delta. Our results revealed that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play critical roles in synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by affecting Spt23. In addition, the results demonstrated that both Ubx1 and Ubx2 are involved in lipid droplet formation and protein degradation. Deletion of UBX1 led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and disruption of UBX2 impaired cell viability under osmotic stress. The phenotypes of ubx1Delta+UBX2, ubx2Delta+UBX1 and ubx1Deltaubx2Delta and RNA-seq data suggested that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play different roles in cell functions, and the roles of Ubx1 may be more numerous than Ubx2. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the relationship between lipid homeostasis and cell functions in the oil-producing organism P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical characterization of Aspergillus oryzae recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase protein revealed smeared bands with apparent molecular mass of 90-130 kDa. After N-deglycosylation, the recombinant enzyme showed a molecular mass of 70 kDa. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at a pH of 5.0 and a temperature of 70 degrees C. Specific activity of the enzyme was higher toward hesperidin than toward naringin, which consist of alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,2 linkages, respectively. The activity was also higher toward hesperidin than toward rutin, which consist of 7-O- and 3-O-glycosyl linkages of flavonoids, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme showed that the Michaelis constant (Km) was lowest toward rutin, moderate toward naringin, and higher toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside and hesperidin. Its high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward rutin was results of its low Km value while its high catalytic efficiency toward hesperidin was results of a considerably high kcat value.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of Functional Anti-Ebola Antibodies in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

We then created strains expressing each of the three monoclonal antibodies that comprise the ZMapp cocktail, and demonstrated that the secreted antibodies bind to the Ebola virus glycoprotein by immunofluorescence assay. We anticipate that this approach could accelerate the production of therapeutics against future pathogen outbreaks.</p></details><hr><h4>A Novel Colletotrichum graminicola Raffinose Oxidase in the AA5 Family.</h4><p>M. Andberg et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 83  (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778886>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe here the identification and characterization of a copper radical oxidase from auxiliary activities family 5 (AA5_2) that was distinguished by showing preferential activity toward raffinose. Despite the biotechnological potential of carbohydrate oxidases from family AA5, very few members have been characterized. The gene encoding raffinose oxidase from Colletotrichum graminicola (CgRaOx; EC 1.1.3.-) was identified utilizing a bioinformatics approach based on the known modular structure of a characterized AA5_2 galactose oxidase. CgRaOx was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the purified enzyme displayed the highest activity on the trisaccharide raffinose, whereas the activity on the disaccharide melibiose was three times lower and more than ten times lower activity was detected on d-galactose at a 300 mM substrate concentration. Thus, the substrate preference of CgRaOx was distinguished clearly from the substrate preferences of the known galactose oxidases. The site of oxidation for raffinose was studied by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, and we confirmed that the hydroxyl group at the C-6 position was oxidized to an aldehyde and that in addition uronic acid was produced as a side product. A new electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method for the identification of C-6 oxidized products was developed, and the formation mechanism of the uronic acid was studied. CgRaOx presented a novel activity pattern in the AA5 family.IMPORTANCE Currently, there are only a few characterized members of the CAZy AA5 protein family. These enzymes are interesting from an application point of view because of their ability to utilize the cheap and abundant oxidant O2 without the requirement of complex cofactors such as FAD or NAD(P). Here, we present the identification and characterization of a novel AA5 member from Colletotrichum graminicola As discussed in the present study, the bioinformatics approach using the modular structure of galactose oxidase was successful in finding a C-6 hydroxyl carbohydrate oxidase having substrate preference for the trisaccharide raffinose. By the discovery of this activity, the diversity of the CAZy AA5 family is increasing.</p></details><hr><h4>An automated data-driven DSP development approach for glycoproteins from yeast.</h4><p>V.

In a previous study, we purified three recombinant glycoproteins from Pichia pastoris using a simple two-step flowthrough mode approach using monolithic columns. In this study, we investigated a novel automated data science approach for identifying purification conditions for such glycoproteins using monolithic columns. We performed three sets of design of experiments in analytical scale to determine the separation efficiency of monolithic columns for three different recombinant horseradish peroxidase (HRP) isoenzymes. For ease of calculation, we introduced an arbitrary term, the relative impurity removal (IR), which is representative of the amount of impurities cleared. Both, the experimental part and the data analysis were automated and took less than 40 min for each HRP isoenzyme. We tested the identified purification conditions in laboratory scale and performed respective offline analyses to verify results from analytical scale. We found a clear correlation between the IR estimated online through our novel data-driven approach and the IR determined offline. Summarizing, we present a novel methodology, applying analytical scale advantages which can be used for fast and efficient DSP development for recombinant glycoproteins from yeast without offline analyses.</p></details><hr><h4>Co-expression of lipase isozymes for enhanced expression in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H. Cai et al., Lett Appl Microbiol 65 335 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763110>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To enhance the overall expression level of lipase isozymes which catalyse the same reaction in Pichia pastoris through co-expression of isozymes from different sources; several types of co-expression ways were constructed to determine the co-expression efficiencies of lipase isozymes in P. pastoris. The results showed that the Kex2-mediated co-expression of lipase isozymes could express Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) and Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) simultaneously, and GS-RMk-kTL displayed an average lipase activity of 306.91 U ml(-1) , higher than GS-RML and GS-kTL (2.89 and 300.59 U ml(-1) ) expressed independently in P. pastoris, and the sum of both (303.48 U ml(-1) ), implying the potential of isozyme co-expression mediated by Kex2 in increasing the overall recombinant expression, but the low recombinant expression of RML in P. pastoris weakened the overall increasing effect on lipase expression in the isozyme co-expression strains. In addition, the fusion isozymes were successfully expressed, but with low lipase activities. Furthermore, 2A peptide could successfully mediate the co-expression and secretion of lipase isozymes, but it seriously affected the expression of TLL downstream of 2A peptide.</p><p><strong> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> The low production level is one of the limitation factors for decreasing the prices of enzymes and expanding their application in industry as the biocatalysts. This research focuses on developing lipase isozyme co-expression strategies in Pichia pastoris to enhance the expression level of overall lipase isozymes which catalyse the same reaction. The Kex2-mediated co-expression strategy of lipase isozymes could potentially enhance the overall isozyme expression, and isozyme co-expression might provide a new direction for improving the recombinant isozyme expression, and decreasing the production and application prices of these mixed enzymes as biocatalysts.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>W.

They are important nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products that are biosynthesized through the action of chondroitin sulfotransferases on either an unsulfated chondroitin or a dermatan polysaccharide precursor. While the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfates are well known, the cloning end expression of these membrane-bound Golgi enzymes continue to pose challenges. The major chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase, Homo sapiens C4ST-1, had been previously cloned and expressed from mammalian CHO, COS-7, and HEK 293 cells, and its activity was shown to require glycosylation. In the current study, a C4ST-1 construct was designed and expressed in both Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris in its non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms. Both constructs showed similar activity albeit different kinetic parameters when acting on a microbially prepared unsulfated chondroitin substrate. Moreover, the glycosylated form of C4ST-1 showed lower stability than the non-glycosylated form.</p></details><hr><h4>Towards systems metabolic engineering in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. P.

Already, a sizeable amount of systems biology knowledge has been acquired for this non-conventional yeast. By applying various omics-technologies, productivity features have been thoroughly analyzed and optimized via genetic engineering. However, challenging clonal variability, limited vector repertoire and insufficient genome annotation have hampered further developments. Yet, in the last few years a reinvigorated effort to establish P. pastoris as a host for both protein and metabolite production is visible. A variety of compounds from terpenoids to polyketides have been synthesized, often exceeding the productivity of other microbial systems. The clonal variability was systematically investigated and strategies formulated to circumvent untargeted events, thereby streamlining the screening procedure. Promoters with novel regulatory properties were discovered or engineered from existing ones. The genetic tractability was increased via the transfer of popular manipulation and assembly techniques, as well as the creation of new ones. A second generation of sequencing projects culminated in the creation of the second best functionally annotated yeast genome. In combination with landmark physiological insights and increased output of omics-data, a good basis for the creation of refined genome-scale metabolic models was created. The first application of model-based metabolic engineering in P. pastoris showcased the potential of this approach. Recent efforts to establish yeast peroxisomes for compartmentalized metabolite synthesis appear to fit ideally with the well-studied high capacity peroxisomal machinery of P. pastoris. Here, these recent developments are collected and reviewed with the aim of supporting the establishment of systems metabolic engineering in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>High level expression of beta-mannanase (RmMan5A) in Pichia pastoris for partially hydrolyzed guar gum production.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, a novel beta-mannanase gene (RmMan5A) from Rhizomucor miehei was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and subjected for PHGG production. Enzyme activity of fermentation supernatant reached 85,200UmL(-1) after 168h high cell density fermentation. The purified RmMan5A exhibited the highest enzyme activity at pH 7.0 and 65 degrees C. RmMan5A was then employed for guar gum hydrolysis and PHGG obtained demonstrated a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 2.5x10(4)Da. Total dietary fiber accounted 90.6% of PHGG and 24.9% (w/w) of PHGG were identified as manno-oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization<7. PHGG was further fractionated (F1-F4) by gradual ethanol precipitation. PHGG F1 with an Mw value of 3.6x10(4)Da and a mannose/galactose (M/G) ratio of 1.47 was precipitated initially, followed by PHGG F2 and F3 which showed lower Mw and higher M/G ratio. According to the structure analysis, the distribution of alpha-d-galactose of PHGG F1 was compact and regular, and that of other fractions was more random. A suitable beta-mannanase for PHGG production and some useful information of PHGG are provided in this paper.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering of Yersinia Phytases to Improve Pepsin and Trypsin Resistance and Thermostability and Application Potential in the Food and Feed Industry.</h4><p>C.

We sought to improve the pepsin and trypsin resistance of YeAPPA from Yersinia enterocolitica and YkAPPA from Y. kristensenii by optimizing amino acid polarity and charge. The predicted pepsin/trypsin cleavage sites F89/K226 in pepsin/trypsin-sensitive YeAPPA and the corresponding sites (F89/E226) in pepsin-sensitive but trypsin-resistant YkAPPA were substituted with S and H, respectively. Six variants were produced in Pichia pastoris for catalytic and biochemical characterization. F89S, E226H, and F89S/E226H elevated pepsin resistance and thermostability and K226H and F89S/K226H improved pepsin and trypsin resistance and stability at 60 degrees C and low pH. All the variants increased the ability of the proteins to hydrolyze phytate in corn meal by 2.6-14.9-fold in the presence of pepsin at 37 degrees C and low pH. This study developed a genetic manipulation strategy specific for pepsin/trypsin-sensitive phytases that can improve enzyme tolerance against proteases and heat and benefit the food and feed industry in a cost-effective way.</p></details><hr><h4>A step forward in laccase exploitation: Recombinant production and evaluation of techno-economic feasibility of the process.</h4><p>C.

The high redox potential laccase POXA1b from Pleurotus ostreatus was chosen as case study of marketable enzyme, due to its desirable properties in terms of activity/stability profile, and already assessed applicability. POXA1b was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris by investigating the effect of inducible and constitutive expression systems on both the yield and the cost of its production. System performances were first assessed in shaken-flasks and then scaled-up in bioreactor. The production level obtained in the inducible system is 42U/mL, while the activity value achieved with the constitutive one is 60U/mL, the highest obtained in constitutive systems so far. The economic feasibility of recombinant laccase production was simulated, describing the case of an Italian small-medium enterprise. Two scenarios were evaluated: Scenario (I) production based on methanol inducible system; Scenario (II) production based on the constitutive system, fed with glycerol. At all the scales the glycerol-based fermentation is more economic than the methanol-based one. The price forecast for rPOXA1b production is 0.34eurokU(-1) for glycerol-based process, and is very competitive with the current price of commercial laccase.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the hepcidin gene from roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus).</h4><p>Y.

Here, we report the molecular characterization and functional analysis of a novel hamp1 hepcidin isoforms Tf-Hep from roughskin sculpin, Trachidermus fasciatus. A cDNA fragment of 988 bp with an ORF of 273 bp was obtained. The coding sequence encodes for a signal peptide of 24 amino acids coupled with a prodomain of 40 amino acids and a mature peptide of 26 amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that Tf-Hep was most abundant in the liver. It could be significantly induced post lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and heavy metal exposure. The mature peptide was expressed as a 6.061 kDa fusion protein in Pichia pastoris GS115. The active purified recombinant protein (rTf-Hep) exhibited a wide spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity in vitro against 4 Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio Anguillarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus megaterium with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-80 mug/ml (0.825-13.2 muM). It also displayed high affinity to polysaccharides on bacteria surface including LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN). We further revealed that rTf-hep was capable of agglutinating 6 of the 8 bacteria. All these results suggest that rTf-hep may be both an antibacterial effector and a pattern recognition molecule in fish immune defense. The in vivo bacterial treatment results demonstrated that rTf-Hep could significantly improve the survival rate of fish infected with V. anguillarum. Taken together, these data indicate an important role for Tf-hep in the innate immunity of Trachidermus fasciatus and suggest its potential application in aquaculture for increasing fish resistance to disease.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel cystatin type 2 from Rhipicephalus microplus midgut.</h4><p>T.

Cattle vaccination is an alternative to control tick infestations, but the discovery of potential antigens is still a challenge for researchers. Recently, our group performed a midgut transcriptome of engorged R. microplus tick, and out of 800 ESTs sequences one cystatin-coding sequence was identified and named Rmcystatin-4. In order to understand the physiological role of Rmcystatin-4, the aim of this work was the expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel type 2 cystatin from the tick R. microplus. Rmcystatin-4 gene expression was identified mostly in tick midgut suggesting its possible role in blood digestion control. Our data showed that rRmcystatin-4 was successfully expressed in active form using Pichia pastoris system and the purified inhibitor presented high selectivity to BmCl-1 (Ki = 0.046 nM). Moreover, rRmcystatin-4 was able to impaired BmCl-1 activity towards bovine hemoglobin.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Bacillus amyloliquefaciens xylanase A expressed in Pichia pastoris and generation of xylooligosaccharides from xylans and wheat bran.</h4><p>M.

The recombinant xylanase, namely rePBaxA, was purified to homogeneity by using Ni-affinity resin and its molecular weight was 35.0kDa. The optimum temperature and pH of rePBaxA were 50 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The kinetic parameters Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of rePBaxA were 5.41mg/mL and 22.42mumol/min/mL, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that after 6h of hydrolysis, rePBaxA released xylose-xylohexaose (X1-X6) mixture from beechwood and birchwood xylan, with xylobiose (X2) and xylotriose (X3) as the major products, respectively. The hydrolyates from oat spelt, wheat bran insoluble xylan and pretreated wheat bran by rePBaxA included X2-X6, with X6 having the highest concentration. The mode of action analysis revealed that rePBaxA was an endo-acting xylanase with transglycosylation activity. X2 might be the minimum oligomer hydrolyzed by rePBaxA. The pretreated wheat bran and wheat bran insoluble xylan could be directly hydrolyzed by rePBaxA. This study provided a basis for using agricultural waste by-products as substrates for manufacting value-added probiotics, namely, xylooligosaccharides.</p></details><hr><h4>(13) C metabolic flux profiling of Pichia pastoris grown in aerobic batch cultures on glucose revealed high relative anabolic use of TCA cycle and limited incorporation of provided precursors of branched-chain amino acids.</h4><p>M. Zhang et al., FEBS J 284 3100 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28731268>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Carbon metabolism of Crabtree-negative yeast Pichia pastoris was profiled using (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to delineate regulation during exponential growth and to study the import of two precursors for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, alpha-ketoisovalerate and alpha-ketobutyrate. Cells were grown in aerobic batch cultures containing (a) only glucose, (b) glucose along with the precursors, or (c) glucose and Val. The study provided the following new insights. First, (13) C flux ratio analyses of central metabolism reveal an unexpectedly high anaplerotic supply of the tricarboxylic acid cycle for a Crabtree-negative yeast, and show that a substantial fraction of glucose catabolism proceeds through the pentose phosphate pathway. A comparison with previous flux ratio analyses for batch cultures of Crabtree-negative Pichia stipitis and Crabtree-positive Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the overall regulation of central carbon metabolism in P. pastoris is intermediate in between P. stipitis and S. cerevisiae. Second, excess alpha-ketoisovalerate in the medium is not transported into the cytoplasm indicating that P. pastoris lacks a suitable transporter. In contrast, excess Val is efficiently taken up and largely fulfills demands for both Val and Leu for protein synthesis. Third, excess alpha-ketobutyrate is transported into the mitochondria for Ile biosynthesis. However, the import does not efficiently inhibit the synthesis of alpha-ketobutyrate from pyruvate indicating that P. pastoris has not been optimized evolutionarily to take full advantage of this carbon source. These findings have direct implications for preparing uniformly (2) H,(13) C,(15) N-labeled proteins containing protonated Ile, Val, and Leu methyl groups in P. pastoris for NMR-based structural biology.</p><p><strong> ENZYMES:</strong> Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (EC 1.1.1.86), branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT, EC 2.6.1.42), fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2), malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39/1.1.1.40), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), l-serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1), threonine aldolase (EC 4.1.2.5), threonine dehydratase (EC 4.3.1.19); transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1), transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2).</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression and purification of a molluskan endoglucanase from Ampullaria crossean in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

A bioactive EG27I with a molecular weight of 27 kDa was successfully expressed and secreted into our culture medium. The respective final OD600 and hydrolytic activity were 333 and 1.28 U/mL when high-cell-density fermentation of the recombinant P. pastoris was performed in a 7.5 L fermenter through a fed-batch strategy for 132 h.

EG27I was consecutively purified from the fermentation supernatant through ultrafiltration, cation exchange, and hydrophobic interaction. The specific activity of the recombinant EG27I was 26.8 U/mg, and the optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme were 5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The half-life of the enzyme activity at 100 degrees C could reach 40 min.

In this study, an endogenous membrane-protein complex was obtained from Pichia pastoris, which can be grown at high densities to significantly improve the membrane protein yield. We successfully isolated the membrane-bound Vo complex of V-ATPase from P. pastoris using a fusion FLAG tag attached to the C-terminus of subunit a to generate the vph-tag strain, which was used for dissociation and purification. After FLAG affinity and size exclusion chromatography purification, the production quantity and purity of the membrane-bound Vo complex was 20 mug l(-1) and >98%, respectively. The subunits of the endogenous membrane-bound Vo complex observed in P. pastoris were similar to those obtained from S. cerevisiae, as demonstrated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).

Here, we report that MS is localized to the nucleus of Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans but is cytoplasmic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae The P. pastoris strain carrying a deletion of the MET6 gene encoding MS (Ppmet6) exhibits methionine as well as adenine auxotrophy indicating that MS is required for methionine as well as adenine biosynthesis. Nuclear localization of P. pastoris MS (PpMS) was abrogated by the deletion of 107 C-terminal amino acids or the R742A mutation. In silico analysis of the PpMS structure indicated that PpMS may exist in a dimer-like configuration in which Arg-742 of a monomer forms a salt bridge with Asp-113 of another monomer. Biochemical studies indicate that R742A as well as D113R mutations abrogate nuclear localization of PpMS and its ability to reverse methionine auxotrophy of Ppmet6 Thus, association of two PpMS monomers through the interaction of Arg-742 and Asp-113 is essential for catalytic activity and nuclear localization. When PpMS is targeted to the cytoplasm employing a heterologous nuclear export signal, it is expressed at very low levels and is unable to reverse methionine and adenine auxotrophy of Ppmet6 Thus, nuclear localization is essential for the stability and function of MS in P. pastoris. We conclude that nuclear localization of MS is a unique feature of respiratory yeasts such as P. pastoris and C. albicans, and it may have novel moonlighting functions in the nucleus.</p></details><hr><h4>Constitutive expression of human gastric lipase in Pichia pastoris and site-directed mutagenesis of key lid-stabilizing residues.</h4><p>L.

The HGL signal peptide was replaced by the yeast alpha-factor to achieve an efficient secretion. Active rHGL was produced by the transformed yeast but its levels and stability were dependent on the pH. The highest activity was obtained upon buffering the culture medium at pH5, a condition that allowed preserving enzyme activity over time. A large fraction (72+/-2%) of secreted rHGL remained however bound to the yeast cells, and was released by washing the cell pellet with an acid glycine-HCl buffer (pH2.2). This procedure allowed establishing a first step of purification that was completed by size exclusion chromatography. N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry revealed that rHGL was produced in its mature form, with a global mass of 50,837+/-32Da corresponding to a N-glycosylated form of HGL polypeptide (43,193Da). rHGL activity was characterized as a function of pH, various substrates and in the presence of bile salts and pepsin, and was found similar to native HGL, except for slight changes in pH optima. We then studied by site-directed mutagenesis the role of three key residues (K4, E225, R229) involved in salt bridges stabilizing the lid domain that controls the access to the active site and is part of the interfacial recognition site. Their substitution has an impact on the pH-dependent activity of rHGL and its relative activities on medium and long chain triglycerides.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a recombinant xylose tolerant beta-xylosidase from Humicola grisea var. thermoidea and its use in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysis.</h4><p>L.

An optimization of enzyme production was carried out, and methanol was found to be the most important parameter. The purified enzyme was characterized and showed the optimal conditions for the highest activity at pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, being thermostable by maintaining 41% of its activity after 12h incubated at 50 degrees C. HXYLA is a bifunctional enzyme; it showed both beta-xylosidase and alpha-arabinfuranosidase activities. The Km and Vmax values were 1.3mM and 39.1U/mg, respectively, against 4-nitrophenyl beta-xylopyranoside. HXYLA showed a relatively strong tolerance to xylose with high Ki value of 603mM, with the xylose being a non-competitive inhibitor. HXYLA was successfully used simultaneously and sequentially with an endo-xylanase for analysis of synergism in the degradation of commercial xylans. Furthermore, commercial cellulases supplementation with HXYLA during sugarcane bagasse hydrolysis increased hydrolysis in 29%.

Due to the difficulties in analyzing a wide range of polarities encountered in the metabolome, 100%-wettable reversed-phase materials are frequently used to maximize metabolome coverage within a single analysis. Packed with silica-based sub-3 mum diameter particles, these columns allow high separation efficiency and offer a reasonable compromise for metabolome coverage within a single analysis. While direct performance comparison can be made using classical chromatographic characterization approaches, a comprehensive assessment of the column's performance for cellular metabolomics requires use of a full LC-HRMS workflow in order to reflect realistic study conditions used for cellular metabolomics. In this study, a comparison of several reversed-phase LC columns for metabolome analysis using such a dedicated workflow is presented. All columns were tested under the same analytical conditions on an LC-TOF-MS platform using a variety of authentic metabolite standards and biotechnologically relevant yeast cell extracts. Data on total workflow performance including retention behavior, peak capacity, coverage, and molecular feature extraction repeatability from these columns are presented with consideration for both nontargeted screening and differential metabolomics workflows using authentic standards and Pichia pastoris cell extract samples.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolic modeling to identify engineering targets for Komagataella phaffii: The effect of biomass composition on gene target identification.</h4><p>A. Cankorur-Cetinkaya, D. Dikicioglu, S. G.

Pichia pastoris). However, as is the case for many industrial microbes, there is no executable metabolic model for K. phaffiii that confirms to current standards by providing the metabolite and reactions IDs, to facilitate model extension and reuse, and gene-reaction associations to enable identification of targets for genetic manipulation. In order to remedy this deficiency, we decided to reconstruct the genome-scale metabolic model of K. phaffii by reconciling the extant models and performing extensive manual curation in order to construct an executable model (Kp.1.0) that conforms to current standards. We then used this model to study the effect of biomass composition on the predictive success of the model. Twelve different biomass compositions obtained from published empirical data obtained under a range of growth conditions were employed in this investigation. We found that the success of Kp1.0 in predicting both gene essentiality and growth characteristics was relatively unaffected by biomass composition. However, we found that biomass composition had a profound effect on the distribution of the fluxes involved in lipid, DNA, and steroid biosynthetic processes, cellular alcohol metabolic process, and oxidation-reduction process. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of biomass composition on the identification of suitable target genes for strain development. The analyses revealed that around 40% of the predictions of the effect of gene overexpression or deletion changed depending on the representation of biomass composition in the model. Considering the robustness of the in silico flux distributions to the changing biomass representations enables better interpretation of experimental results, reduces the risk of wrong target identification, and so both speeds and improves the process of directed strain development.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancing expression of the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein E in yeast and its application in an indirect sandwich ELISA.</h4><p>C.

The characteristics of these two cutinases were investigated and compared. The results indicated that F. solani and A. fumigatus cutinases hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl substrates with different carbon chain lengths. A. fumigatus cutinase predominately hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl butyrate, but F. solani cutinase preferred p-nitrophenyl decanoate. The abilities of polymer synthesis and bioplastic degradation were tested and compared between F. solani and A. fumigatus cutinases. The results showed that F. solani cutinase had degradation ability on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and synthesized polymer with a molecular weight (MW) of 2300 in organic solvent. However, A. fumigatus cutinase completely degraded PCL and synthesized molecules with a MW of 25,000, suggesting that A. fumigatus cutinase has more promising applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Accurate analysis of fusion expression of Pichia pastoris glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified cell wall proteins.</h4><p>P.

The GPI-modified cell wall proteins GCW21, GCW51, and GCW61 of Pichia pastoris were chosen as anchoring proteins to construct co-expression strains in P. pastoris GS115. The hydrolytic activity and the amount of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) displayed on cell surface increased significantly following optimization of the fusion gene dosage and combination of the homogeneous or heterogeneous cell wall proteins. Maximum CALB hydrolytic activity was achieved at 4920 U/g dry cell weight in strain GS115/CALB-GCW (51 + 51 + 61 + 61) after 120 h of methanol induction. Changes in structural morphology and the properties of the cell surfaces caused by co-expression of fusion proteins were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and on plates containing cell-wall-destabilizing reagent. Our results suggested that both the outer and inner cell layers were significantly altered by overexpression of GPI-modified cell wall proteins. Interestingly, quantitative analysis of the inner layer components showed an increase in beta-1,3-glucan, but no obvious changes in chitin in the strains overexpressing GPI-modified cell wall proteins.</p></details><hr><h4>Deleting the first disulphide bond in an arenicin derivative enhances its expression in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>N. Yang et al., Lett Appl Microbiol 65 241 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28656630>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The marine antimicrobial peptide NZ17074, a variant of arenicin-3 from Arenicola marina that has broad antimicrobial activity and high bioavailability, can be designed to treat bacterial and fungal diseases. To reduce the toxicity of NZ17074, N6 was designed by replacing a cysteine in positions 3 and 20 with alanine, fused to the C-terminus of the small ubiquitin-like modifier tag (SUMO), and expressed in yeast. SUMO-N6 yielded as much as 921 mg l(-1) at 72 h after induction in a fermentor and increased 1.8-fold over SUMO-NZ17074. After cleavage with 30% formic acid and purification by a Sephadex G-25 column, 9.7 mg of the recombinant peptide N6 (rN6) was obtained from one-litre fermentation broth, increasing 1.4-fold over NZ17074. Compared to NZ17074, rN6 displayed almost identical antimicrobial activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.5, 0.25-0.5, 4, 0.25-16 and 16 mug ml(-1) against Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains. Our results indicate that the first disulphide bond, Cys3-Cys20, in NZ17074 is not necessary for antimicrobial activity and that its deletion might reduce toxicity to host cells. These findings may help design new antimicrobial peptides harbouring fewer disulphide bridges and may have more potent activity.</p><p><strong> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> Disulphide bond formation is an important step in the protein expression and can also influence protein secretion. A deletion of the first disulphide bond in NZ17074 increased the secreted level of target protein, and its antimicrobial activity was almost unaffected by the deletion of the first disulphide bond. The first disulphide bond in NZ17074 is favourable for correctly forming another disulphide bond during expression but not necessary for its activity. This may help design and produce a novel class of antimicrobial peptides harbouring fewer disulphide bridges to save the cost.</p></details><hr><h4>Variants of PpuLcc, a multi-dye decolorizing laccase from Pleurotus pulmonarius expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

The PpuLcc was purified from the culture supernatant via FPLC, and the corresponding gene cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. To examine the impact of the C-terminal tail region and the signal peptide on the recombinant expression of PpuLcc, a non-modified version or different truncations (-2, -5, -13 AA) of the target protein were combined with different secretion signals. Heterologous expression of codon optimized constructs resulted in extracellular activities of the PpuLcc variants of up to 7000 U L(-1) (substrate ABTS) which was six times higher than non-codon optimized constructs. In contrast to previous works, altering the C-terminal end of the protein did not influence kinetic parameters or the rate of expression. The His-Tag purified enzymes showed high temperature optima (50-70 degrees C) and thermo stability. All of the recombinant variants degraded triarylmethane and azo dyes. Rapid bleaching of beta-carotene (E 160a) and the polyene acid norbixin (E 160b) using a laccase was found for the first time. Thus, the enzyme may be useful in decolorizing unwanted polyene pigments, for example from the processing of cheese, bakery, desserts, ice cream or coloured casings.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcriptional engineering of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter for improved heterologous protein production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

We constructed a synthetic library with distinct regulatory properties through deletion and duplication of these putative transcription factor binding sites and selected transcription factor (TF) genes were overexpressed or deleted to understand their roles on heterologous protein production. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein, an expression strength in a range between 0.35- and 3.10-fold of the wild-type PGAP was obtained. Another model protein, recombinant human growth hormone was produced under control of selected promoter variants and 1.6- to 2.4-fold higher product titers were reached compared to wild-type PGAP . In addition, a GAL4-like TF was found to be a crucial factor for the regulation of PGAP , and its overexpression enhanced the heterologous protein production considerably (up to 2.2-fold compared to the parental strain). The synthetic PGAP library generated enabled us to investigate the different putative transcription factors which are responsible for the regulation of PGAP under different growth conditions, ergo recombinant protein production under PGAP .

Lee et al., Protein Expr Purif 137 7 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619526>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a highly successful recombinant protein expression system due to its ability to quickly generate large quantities of recombinant proteins in simple media. P. pastoris has been used to successfully generate milligram quantities of many important human membrane proteins, including G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, and transporters, which are becoming increasingly important therapeutic targets. Despite these successes, protein expression in P. pastoris is still cumbersome due to a need to change growth media from glycerol media to methanol induction media, which minimizes inhibition of the AOX1 promoter by residual glycerol. Taking advantage of this behavior of the AOX1 promoter, we developed Buffered extra-YNB Glycerol Methanol (BYGM) auto-induction media (100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 2.68% w/v YNB, 0.4% v/v glycerol, 0.5% v/v methanol, and 8 x 10(-5)% w/v biotin) which not only simplified the protein expression process, but also optimized protein expression levels in P. pastoris. We successfully used this auto-induction method to overexpress the target in both Mut(S) and Mut(+) strains. Moreover, we show that this method can facilitate screening high-expressing clones, as well as enable parallel protein production in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>ATP Sulfurylase is Essential for the Utilization of Sulfamate as a Sulfur Source in the Yeast Komagataella pastoris (syn. Pichia pastoris).</h4><p>T.

Pichia pastoris) is one of the few known yeasts that can utilize sulfamate ([Formula: see text]) as a sulfur source. The biochemical pathway responsible for the catabolism of sulfamate has yet to be identified. The present study sought to investigate whether sulfamate catabolism proceeds through either of the inorganic sulfur intermediates sulfate ([Formula: see text]) or sulfite ([Formula: see text]) before its assimilation and subsequent incorporation into sulfur-containing amino acids and their derivatives. Two key genes in the K. pastoris inorganic sulfur assimilation pathway were deleted separately and the ability of each deletion mutant to utilize sulfamate and other selected sulfur sources was studied. Deletion of the MET3 gene (which encodes the enzyme ATP sulfurylase) did not affect growth on L-methionine, sulfite, methanesulfonate, or taurine but completely abolished growth on sulfate, methyl sulfate and sulfamate. Deletion of the MET5 gene (which encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme sulfite reductase) abolished growth on all tested sulfur sources except L-methionine. These results suggest that the catabolism of sulfamate proceeds through a sulfate intermediate before its assimilation.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of a novel GH11 xylanase from saline-alkali soil with excellent tolerance to high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol.</h4><p>H.

The purified recombinant Xyn11-1 showed its maximal activity at pH 6.0, and retained more than 60.4% of activity at pH 10.0, with good pH stability. Its optimal temperature was 50 degrees C and it was stable after incubation for 1 h at 30 degrees C. Furthermore, Xyn11-1 was highly salt-tolerant, retaining more than 77.4% of activity in the presence of 0.25-4 M NaCl and displaying more than 47.2% relative activity after being incubated in the presence of 5 M NaCl at 37 degrees C for 10 min. In addition, 5 mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, Cu(2+), Co(2+), and Mn(2+) increased the xylanase activity by 22.3%, 8.8%, 7.1%, and 4.4%, respectively. Significantly, 93.4% and 59.8% of the optimal activity was retained in the presence of 2% and 10% (v/v) ethanol, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the Km,Vmax, and Kcat value of Xyn11-1 for beechwood xylan were 3.7 mg ml(-1), 101.0 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) and 42.1 s(-1), respectively. Xyn11-1 is a strict endo-beta-1,4-xylanase, its main enzymatic products being xylotetraose and xylopentaose. Xyn11-1 is the first reported GH11 xylanase isolated from saline-alkali soil, and has excellent tolerance of high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol, which indicates its great potential for basic research and industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant thermo-alkali-stable endoglucanase of Myceliopthora thermophila BJA (rMt-egl): Biochemical characteristics and applicability in enzymatic saccharification of agro-residues.</h4><p>P.

To address this, we have redesigned the GGl I gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) while retaining the same amino acid sequence. The wild type and codon optimised GGl I (GGl I-wt and GGl I-op) were synthesised and cloned into pPICZalphaA with an N-terminal 6 x His tag sequence and expressed in P. pastoris X 33. The hydrolytic activity of GGl I-op was 150 U/mL, whereas the activity of the GGl I-wt could not be detected. GGl I-op recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and then characterised. The identity and purity of GGl I were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. Enzymatic deglycosylation was used to show that the lipase is a glycosylated protein, containing approximately 10% sugar. The molecular weight (MW) of the GGl I secreted by recombinant P. pastoris was approximated at 63 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant lipase were 8.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was active over a broad pH range (7.0-9.0) and temperature range (20 degrees C-45 degrees C). The lipase showed high activity toward medium- and long-chain fatty acid methyl esters (C8-C16) and retained much of its activity in the presence of Tween-80 and Trition X-100. Lipase activity was stimulated by Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+) and Cu(2+) and inhibited by Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+). This lipase may prove useful to the detergent industry and in organic synthesis reactions.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolic construction strategies for direct methanol utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</h4><p>Z.

Recently we have developed monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins targeting human CD25(+) cells using advanced unique diphtheria toxin resistant yeast Pichia Pastoris expression system. In vitro efficacy characterization using human CD25(+) HUT102/6TG cells demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent isoforms are potent and the bivalent isoform is approximately two logs more potent than the monovalent isoform. In this study, we further assessed the in vivo efficacy of the human IL-2 fusion toxins using human CD25(+) HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mouse model. The data demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins significantly prolonged the survival of the human CD25(+) tumor-bearing NSG mice in a dose-dependent manner. Then we further assessed the residual tumor cells from the HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mice using the residual tumor cell bearing NSG mouse model. The results demonstrated that the residual tumor cells were still sensitive to the continual treatment with the human IL-2 fusion toxin. This yeast-expressed human IL-2 fusion toxin will be a promising candidate to replace the clinically discontinued Ontak(R).</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel thermostable GH45 endoglucanase from Chaetomium thermophilum and its biodegradation of pectin.</h4><p>Q.

Sequence alignment indicated that the CTendo45 enzyme belonged to glycoside hydrolase family 45. The recombinant enzyme was purified by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography, and its apparent molecular mass was estimated to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme displayed maximum activity at 70 degrees C and pH 4. CTendo45 was stable at 60 degrees C for 1 h, and residual activities of 78.9% and 65.6% were estimated after 1 h at 70 degrees C and 80 degrees C, respectively. Ca(2+), Zn(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+) and Mn(2+) were found to have beneficial effects on the enzyme activity to different degrees. The specific activity of purified CTendo45 was 1.52 IU mg(-1) and the Km value was 59.6 mug ml(-1) with a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose substrate. Moreover, CTendo45 exhibited high hydrolysis activity towards pectin, and the hydrolysis products were mainly galacturonic acid oligosaccharides. CTendo45 is the first reported bifunctional enzyme in glycoside hydrolase family 45 from C. thermophilum that is able to hydrolyze both cellulose and pectin. The biochemical properties of this recombinant CTendo45 make it a potentially effective glycoside hydrolase for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Impact of "a" determinant mutations on detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HBV strains from Chinese patients with occult hepatitis B.</h4><p>X.

Twenty-three certified OHB samples were compared to 32 HBsAg positive samples from patients with chronic hepatitis B. The median HBV DNA levels in the OHB group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.0001). Mutations within the "a" determinant were analyzed by gene amplification and sequencing. This revealed mixed infections in which clones within a sample displayed either different mutations or mutations in association with clones that exhibited wild type amino acid patterns. Sequencing analysis also showed a significant difference between the proportions of amino acid mutations observed in the OHB and control groups. Seven recombinant S (rS) proteins with corresponding OHB mutations and three wild type alleles were expressed and purified in the Pichia pastoris expression system to preserve conformational attributes, and their reactivity analyzed using six commercial HBsAg assays. The OHB sera were HBsAg nonreactive while the rS proteins with corresponding OHB mutations were universally reactive. Thus, we postulate that the reduced binding affinity between mutated HBsAg and its antibody may not be as important in defining OHB as is the effect of specific mutations in the preS/S region of the genome that affect the synthesis and secretion of the S protein and/or the virion.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the temperature characteristics and catalytic efficiency of a mesophilic xylanase from Aspergillus oryzae, AoXyn11A, by iterative mutagenesis based on in silico design.</h4><p>X.

Thus, one variant with the highest thermostability, AoXyn11A(G21I), was selected from the mutagenesis library, E. coli/Aoxyn11A (G21X) (</p><p><strong>X:</strong> any one of 20 amino acids). Secondly, based on the primary structure multiple alignment of AoXyn11A with seven thermophilic GHF11 xylanases, AoXyn11A(Y13F) or AoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F), was designed by replacing Tyr(13) in AoXyn11A or AoXyn11A(G21I) with Phe. Finally, three variant-encoding genes, Aoxyn11A (G21I), Aoxyn11A (Y13F) and Aoxyn11A (G21I-Y13F), were constructed by two-stage whole-plasmid PCR method, and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, respectively. The temperature optimum (T opt) of recombinant (re) AoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) was 60 degrees C, being 5 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11A(G21I) or reAoXyn11A(Y13F), and 10 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11A. The thermal inactivation half-life (t 1/2) of reAoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) at 50 degrees C was 240 min, being 40-, 3.4- and 2.5-fold longer than those of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11A(G21I) and reAoXyn11A(Y13F). The melting temperature (T m) values of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11A(G21I), reAoXyn11A(Y13F) and reAoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) were 52.3, 56.5, 58.6 and 61.3 degrees C, respectively. These findings indicated that the iterative mutagenesis of both Gly21Ile and Tyr13Phe improved the temperature characteristics of AoXyn11A in a synergistic mode. Besides those, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of reAoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) was 473.1 mL mg(-1) s(-1), which was 1.65-fold higher than that of reAoXyn11A.</p></details><hr><h4>Autolysis of Pichia pastoris induced by cold.</h4><p>Y. Bartolo-Aguilar et al., AMB Express 7 95 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28500590>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The production of recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins is a multi-billion dollar market. Protein recovery represents a major part of the production costs. Pichia pastoris is one of the microbial systems most used for the production of heterologous proteins. The use of a cold-induced promoter to express lytic enzymes in the yeast after the growth stage could reduce protein recovery costs. This study shows that a cold-shock can be applied to induce lysis of the yeast cells. A strain of P. pastoris was constructed in which the endogenous eng gene encoding a putative endo-beta-1,3-glucanase was overexpressed using the cold-shock induced promoter of the cctalpha gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the transgenic P. pastoris, the expression of eng increased 3.6-fold after chilling the cells from 30 to 4 degrees C (cold-shock stage) followed by incubation for 6 h (eng expression stage). The culture was heated to 30 degrees C for 6 h (ENG synthesis stage) and kept at 37 degrees C for 24 h (lysis stage). After this procedure the cell morphology changed, spheroplasts were obtained and cellular lysis was observed. Thus, a clone of P. pastoris was obtained, which undergoes autolysis after a cold-shock.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular strategies to increase the levels of heterologous transcripts in Komagataella phaffii for protein production.</h4><p>L. C. Piva et al., Bioengineered 8 441 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399696>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris) is a well-known fungal system for heterologous protein production in the context of modern biotechnology. To obtain higher protein titers in this system many researchers have sought to optimize gene expression by increasing the levels of transcription of the heterologous gene. This has been typically achieved by manipulating promoter sequences or by generating clones bearing multiple copies of the desired gene. The aim of this work is to describe how these different molecular strategies have been applied in K. phaffii presenting their advantages and drawbacks.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and expression of a chitinase gene from Eisenia fetida.</h4><p>M. Ueda et al., Int J Biol Macromol 104 1648 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373044>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Chitin is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature and is an important resource. In this study, we identified a chitinase gene, named Eisenia fetida-Chitinase (EF-Chi) gene, of 1494 base pairs (bp) that encodes a protein of 498 amino acids as indicated by the corresponding mRNA sequence. The amino acid sequence of EF-Chi was similar to those of chitinases from Eisenia andrei (99%), Branchiostoma floridae (50%) and Oryzias latipes (49%), and a gene encoding mature EF-Chi was expressed in the GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of the purified recombinant EF-Chi (rEF-Chi) was estimated to be 60kDa and catalytically important residues of chitinases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18 were conserved in EF-Chi. The optimal catalytic temperature of rEF-Chi was identified as 60 degrees C, and the hydrolytic product from colloidal chitin was N-acetyl-chitobiose, suggesting that EF-Chi is an exo-type enzyme.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a new laccase from Moniliophthora roreri at high levels in Pichia pastoris and its potential application in micropollutant degradation.</h4><p>A. Bronikowski, P. L. Hagedoorn, K. Koschorreck, V. B. Urlacher, AMB Express 7 73 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357784>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Laccases have gained significant attention due to their emerging applications including bioremediation, biomass degradation and biofuel cells. One of the prerequisites for the industrial application of laccases is their sufficient availability. However, expression levels of recombinantly expressed laccases are often low. In this study Mrl2, a new laccase from the basidiomycete Moniliophthora roreri, was cloned in Pichia pastoris and produced in an optimized fed-batch process at an exceptionally high yield of 1.05 g l(-1). With a redox potential of 0.58 V, Mrl2 belongs to mid-redox potential laccases. However, Mrl2 demonstrated high kcat values of 316, 20, 74, and 36 s(-1) towards 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), syringaldazine (SGZ), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP) and guaiacol, respectively. Mrl2 remained stable above pH 6 and in the presence of many metal ions, which is important for application in bioremediation. Mrl2 was investigated for the ability to degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSDAIs) at neutral pH value. The enzyme accepted and converted estrone, 17beta-estradiol, estriol, the synthetic contraceptive 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and bisphenol A at pH 7 faster than high-potential laccases from Trametes versicolor. For example, within 30 min Mrl2 removed more than 90% bisphenol A, 17ss-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and estriol, respectively. The concentration of the recalcitrant drug diclofenac dropped by 56% after 20 h incubation with Mrl2.</p></details><hr><h4>Expressing anti-HIV VRC01 antibody using the murine IgG1 secretion signal in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Aw, P. F. McKay, R. J. Shattock, K. M. Polizzi, AMB Express 7 70 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342171>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The use of the recombinant expression platform Pichia pastoris to produce pharmaceutically important proteins has been investigated over the past 30 years. Compared to mammalian cultures, expression in P. pastoris is cheaper and faster, potentially leading to decreased costs and process development times. Product yields depend on a number of factors including the secretion signal chosen for expression, which can influence the host cell response to recombinant protein production. VRC01, a broadly neutralising anti-HIV antibody, was expressed in P. pastoris, using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter for both the heavy and light chains. Titre reached up to 3.05 mug mL(-1) in small scale expression. VRC01 was expressed using both the alpha-mating factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the murine IgG1 signal peptide. Surprisingly, using the murine IgG1 signal peptide resulted in higher yield of antibody capable of binding gp140 antigen. Furthermore, we evaluated levels of secretory stress compared to the untransformed wild-type strain and show a reduced level of secretory stress in the murine IgG1 signal peptide strains versus those containing the alpha-MF signal peptide. As bottlenecks in the secretory pathway are often the limiting factor in protein secretion, reduced levels of secretory stress and the higher yield of functional antibody suggest the murine IgG1 signal peptide may lead to better protein folding and secretion. This work indicates the possibilities for utilising the murine IgG1 signal peptide for a range of antibodies, resulting in high yields and reduced cellular stress.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of maize chitinase-A, a tough allergenic molecule.</h4><p>M. Volpicella et al., Allergy 72 1423 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328103>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Food allergies are recognized as an increasing health concern. Proteins commonly identified as food allergens tend to have one of about 30 different biochemical activities. This leads to the assumption that food allergens must have specific structural features which causes their allergenicity. But these structural features are not completely understood. Uncovering the structural basis of allergenicity would allow improved diagnosis and therapy of allergies and would provide insights for safer food production. The availability of recombinant food allergens can accelerate their structural analysis and benefit specific studies in allergology. Plant chitinases are an example of food allergenic proteins for which structural analysis of allergenicity has only partially been reported. The recombinant maize chitinase, rChiA, was purified from Pichia pastoris extracellular medium by differential precipitation and cation exchange chromatography. Enzyme activity was evaluated by halo-assays and microcalorimetric procedures. rChiA modeling was performed by a two-step procedure, using the Swiss-Model server and Modeller software. Allergenicity of rChiA was verified by immunoblot assays with sera from allergic subjects. rChiA is active in the hydrolysis of glycol chitin and tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose and maintains its activity at high temperatures (70 degrees C) and low pH (pH 3). The molecule is also reactive with IgE from sera of maize-allergic subjects. rChiA is a valuable molecule for further studies on structure-allergenicity relationships and as a tool for diagnosing allergies.</p></details><hr><h4>Potential of Pichia pastoris for the production of industrial penicillin G acylase.</h4><p>H. Maresova et al., Folia Microbiol (Praha) 62 417 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281229>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study deals with the potential of Pichia pastoris X-33 for the production of penicillin G acylase (PGA(A)) from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824. Synthetic gene matching the codon usage of P. pastoris was designed for intracellular and secretion-based production strategies and cloned into vectors pPICZ and pPICZalpha under the control of AOX1 promoter. The simple method was developed to screen Pichia transformants with the intracellularly produced enzyme. The positive correlation between acylase production and pga gene dosage for both expression systems was demonstrated in small scale experiments. In fed-batch bioreactor cultures of X-33/PENS2, an extracellular expression system, total PGA(A) expressed from five copies reached 14,880 U/L of an active enzyme after 142 h; however, 60% of this amount retained in the cytosol. The maximum PGA(A) production of 31,000 U/L was achieved intracellularly from nine integrated gene copies of X-33/PINS2 after 90 h under methanol induction. The results indicate that in both expression systems the production level of PGA(A) is similar but there is a limitation in secretion efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Design and pharmacodynamics of recombinant NZ2114 histidine mutants with improved activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</h4><p>H. Chen et al., AMB Express 7 46 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229435>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>NZ2114 is a promising candidate for therapeutic application owing to its potent activity to Staphylococcus aureus. Our objective was to identify NZ2114 derivatives with improved activity through substitution of His16 and His18 with residues Arginine and Lysine. Eight mutants were designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 via pPICZalphaA. Five of them exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus at low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.057-0.454 muM. Among them, H1, H2, and H3 showed ideal pharmacodynamic effects on methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300. The total protein level of H1, H2, and H3 reached 1.70, 1.77 and 1.54 g/l at 120 h of induction in the 5-l fermenter, respectively. They killed over 99.9% of pathogens within 1.5 h at 2x and 4x MIC. The post antibiotic effect of H1, H2 and H3 to S. aureus ATCC43300 was 2.94, 1.75 and 1.55 h at 2x MIC, which was similar with their original peptide NZ2114 (1.43 h) and vancomycin (1.72 h). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated indifferent effects between H1, H2, H3 and vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampicin. Additionally, they had low hemolysis and high stability in different environments (temperature, pH, proteases, and saline ions). All results indicate that H1, H2, and H3 can be produced in large-scale and have potential as therapeutic drugs against MRSA.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Helicoverpa armigera cytochrome P450 CYP6B7 in Pichia pastoris and interactions of CYP6B7 with insecticides.</h4><p>C.

In this study, the CYP6B7 gene from H. armigera (namely HaCYP6B7), was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. A vector pPICZA-HaCYP6B7 was constructed and transformed into P. pastoris GS115, the transformant of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-GS115 was then cultured and induced by 1% (v/v) methanol and the heterologous expression of HaCYP6B7 protein in P. pastoris was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Microsomes containing the expressed HaCYP6B7 showed activities against model substrate p-nitroanisole and 7-ethoxycoumarin, with p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (PNOD) and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD) activities of 15.66- and 4.75-fold of the control, respectively. Moreover, it showed degradation activities against the insecticides bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos, with clearance activities of 6.88-, 1.49- and 2.27-fold of the control, respectively. The interactions of HaCYP6B7 with insecticides were further confirmed by molecular docking in silico with binding scores of 5.450, 5.295 and 2.197 between putative HaCYP6B7 protein and bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos, respectively.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The results of present study provided more direct and important evidence on the role of HaCYP6B7 conferring pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera.

Liu et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem 64 627 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27572239>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Human serum albumin (HSA) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) fusion protein is a potential long-acting drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Previously, the expression level of HSA/IL1Ra in Pichia pastoris was successfully improved by increasing the gene copy number and coexpression with chaperone (protein disulfide isomerase) in our laboratory. However, the overexpression strain resulted in low production of high- cell-density fermentation. In this study, the culture medium was optimized in both flask and fermenter, and the optimum culture medium notably increased the productivity and stability of HSA/IL1Ra. To further improve the expression, response surface methodology was used to further optimize the culture condition through modeling three selected parameters (induction pH, induction temperature [T], and maximum methanol feed rate [Vm ]). The maximum yield of HSA/IL1Ra reached 1.1 g/L (10-fold higher than original fermentation condition) under the optimized culture condition (pH 7.0, T = 29 and Vm = 4.82 mL/L/H) in a 5-L fermenter. In addition, the degradation position of HSA/IL1Ra during fermentation was determined to be K571, serving as a potential target for genetic modification strategies to reduce the degradation. Finally, the in vivo activity study showed that HSA/IL1Ra maintained the therapeutic effect of IL1Ra in type 2 diabetes model rats meanwhile reducing the frequency of administration.</p></details><hr><h4>Wide dynamic range of surface-plasmon-resonance-based assay for hepatitis B surface antigen antibody optimal detection in comparison with ELISA.</h4><p>Y.

Recombinant HBsAg was immobilized onto the sensor surface of a CM5 chip at a concentration of 150 mg/L in sodium acetate buffer at pH 4 with added 0.6% Triton X-100. A regeneration solution of 20 mM HCl was optimally found to effectively unbind analytes from the ligand, thus allowing for multiple screening cycles. A dynamic range of detection of approximately 0.00098-0.25 mg/L was obtained, and a sevenfold higher LOD, as well as a twofold increase in coefficient of variance of the replicated results, was shown as compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Evaluation of the assay for specificity showed no cross-reactivity with other antibodies tested. The ability of SPR chip-based assay and ELISA to detect anti-HBs in human serum was comparable, indicating that the SPR chip-based assay with its multiple screening capacity has greater advantage over ELISA.</p></details><hr><h4>Overexpression and characterization of a novel endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanase from thermophilic fungus Humicola insolens Y1.</h4><p>J.

The 988-bp full-length gene encoded a 286-residue polypeptide consisting of a putative signal peptide of 20 residues and a catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 16. It was successfully overexpressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The purified recombinant Cel16A exhibited highest specific activity toward barley beta-glucan, followed by lichenan and laminarin, but not toward CMC-Na, birchwood xylan, Avicel and filter paper, indicating that Cel16A is an endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanases. Recombinant Cel16A had a pH optimum at 5.5 and a temperature optimum at 55 degrees C with a specific activity of 693 U/mg toward barley beta-glucan. It exhibited good stability over pH 5.0-9.0 and at temperatures up to 50 degrees C, retaining over 80% maximum activity. The Km and Vmax values of Cel16A for barley beta-glucan were 0.91 mg ml(-1) and 1530 mumol min(-1).mg(-1), respectively. All these favorable enzymatic properties of Cel16A make it a good candidate for applications in various industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of bioactive recombinant rat soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (rrsRAGE) in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>P.

To further study the function of sRAGE, recombinant rat sRAGE (rrsRAGE) was expressed and produced in a eukaryotic system. The open reading frame of rat sRAGE was cloned downstream of the methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase promoter of pPICZalphaA vector, and Pichia pastoris strain X-33 was used as the host strain. The expression of rrsRAGE was achieved by fermentation in a 15-L bioreactor and the resulting fermentation broth was subjected to purification on a cation exchange chromatography column. The purification of rrsRAGE reached 95% after size exclusion chromatography(SEC). The bioactivity of the purified protein was confirmed in a SH-SY5Y cell proliferation assay. The biological function of the purified rrsRAGE protein rat CCl4-induced model was then examined. Treatment with rrsRAGE resulted in significantly lower liver fibrosis and lower serum level of ALT, suggesting that sRAGE prevent liver from injury and fibrosis. In conclusion, we achieved high-efficiency production of bioactive rrsRAGE in P. pastoris.</p></details>
