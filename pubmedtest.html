In the present study, a lipase-encoding gene, TllipA, was cloned from Trichoderma lentiforme ACCC30425 and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The purified recombinant TlLipA was found to have optimal activities at 50 degrees C and pH 9.5 and retain stable over the pH range of 6.0-10.0 and 40 degrees C and below. When using esters of different lengths as substrates, TlLipA showed preference for the medium length p-nitrophenyl octanoate. In comparison to commercial lipases, TlLipA demonstrated higher tolerance to various surfactants (SDS, Tween 20, and Triton X100) and retained more activities after incubation with Triton X100 for up to 24 h. These favorable characteristics make TlLipA prospective as an additive in the detergent industry.</p></details></div>

Improving the efficiency of existing biotechnological manufacturing processes is therefore paramount. When produced biotechnologically, trypsinogen-the inactive precursor of trypsin-is advantageous, since active trypsin would impair cell viability. To study factors affecting cell physiology and the production of trypsinogen in fed-batch cultures, we built a fusion protein of porcine trypsinogen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in Pichia pastoris. The experiments were performed with two different pH values (5.0 and 5.9) and two constant specific growth rates (0.02 and 0.04 1/h), maintained using exponential addition of methanol. All the productivity data presented rely on an active determination of trypsin obtained by proteolysis of the trypsinogen produced. The pH of the medium did not affect cell growth, but significantly influenced specific production of trypsinogen: A 1.7-fold higher concentration of trypsinogen was achieved at pH 5.9 (64 mg/L at 0.02 1/h) compared to pH 5.0. EGFP was primarily used to facilitate detection of intracellular protein over the biosynthetic time course. Using flow cytometry with fluorescence detection, cell disruption was avoided, and protein extraction and purification prior to analysis were unnecessary. However, Western blot and SDS-PAGE showed that cleavage of EGFP-trypsinogen fusion protein occurred, probably caused by Pichia-endogenous proteases. The fluorescence analysis did therefore not accurately represent the actual trypsinogen concentration. However, we gained new experimentally-relevant insights, which can be used to avoid misinterpretation of tracking and quantifying as well as online-monitoring of proteins with the frequently used fluorescent tags.</p></details></div>

Antibodies to any given DENV serotype which can afford protection against that serotype tend to enhance infection by other DENV serotypes, by a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Antibodies to the viral pre-membrane (prM) protein have been implicated in ADE. We show that co-expression of the envelope protein of all four DENV serotypes, in the yeast Pichia pastoris, leads to their co-assembly, in the absence of prM, into tetravalent mosaic VLPs (T-mVLPs), which retain the serotype-specific antigenic integrity and immunogenicity of all four types of their monomeric precursors. Following a three-dose immunisation schedule, the T-mVLPs elicited EDIII-directed antibodies in mice which could neutralise all four DENV serotypes. Importantly, anti-T-mVLP antibodies did not augment sub-lethal DENV-2 infection of dengue-sensitive AG129 mice, based on multiple parameters. The 'four-in-one' tetravalent T-mVLPs possess multiple desirable features which may potentially contribute to safety (non-viral, prM-lacking and ADE potential-lacking), immunogenicity (induction of virus-neutralising antibodies), and low cost (single tetravalent immunogen produced using P. pastoris, an expression system known for its high productivity using simple inexpensive media). These results strongly warrant further exploration of this vaccine candidate.</p></details></div>

The procedures for preparation of methyl-specific isotopically-labeled proteins were established for the Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system, but typically it is not feasible to express eukaryotic proteins using E. coli. The Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) expression system is the most common yeast expression system, and is known to be superior to the E. coli system for the expression of mammalian proteins, including secretory and membrane proteins. However, this system has not yet been optimized for methyl-specific isotope labeling, especially for Val/Leu-methyl specific isotope incorporation. To overcome this difficulty, we explored various culture conditions for the yeast cells to efficiently uptake Val/Leu precursors. Among the searched conditions, we found that the cultivation pH has a critical effect on Val/Leu precursor uptake. At an acidic cultivation pH, the uptake of the Val/Leu precursor was increased, and methyl groups of Val and Leu in the synthesized recombinant protein yielded intense (1)H-(13)C correlation signals. Based on these results, we present optimized protocols for the Val/Leu-methyl-selective (13)C incorporation by the P. pastoris expression system.</p></details></div>

The cryoprotective effects of recombinant carrot ( Daucus carota) antifreeze protein (rCaAFP), type II antifreeze protein from Epinephelus coioides (rFiAFP), and Tenebrio molitor antifreeze protein (rTmAFP) produced from Pichia pastoris GS115 on hydrated gluten, glutenin, and gliadin during freezing were investigated. The thermal hysteresis (TH) activity and ice crystals morphology modification ability of recombinant antifreeze proteins (rAFPs) were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cryomicroscope, respectively. The freezing and melting properties, water state, rheological properties, and microstructure of hydrated gluten proteins were studied by DSC, low field nuclear magnetic resonance, rheometer, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The rTmAFP exhibited strongest TH activity and ice crystals morphology modification ability, followed by rFiAFP and rCaAFP. The addition of the three rAFPs caused freezing hysteresis and weakened the damage of freezing to the networks of hydrated gluten, glutenin, and gliadin. During freezing, the cryoprotective effects of the three rAFPs on the freezable water content, water mobility and distribution, and rheological properties of hydrated gluten were achieved by protecting these corresponding properties of hydrated glutenin. Among the three rAFPs, rTmAFP was most effective in the cryoprotective activities on hydrated gluten proteins during freezing. The results demonstrate the potential of these rAFPs, especially rTmAFP, to preserve the above properties of hydrated gluten proteins during freezing process.</p></details></div>

The gene except for the signal sequence was cloned into a vector pPICZalphaA and the recombinant protein was secreted into the medium as an active enzyme. Recombinant AoTanB highly expressed in the incubation at 18 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C. Purified recombinant protein exhibited smeared band with molecular mass of approximately 90-120 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein yielded molecular mass of 65 kDa after N-deglycosylation. Purified recombinant enzyme had a pH and a temperature optima of 6.0 and 30-35 degrees C, respectively, and was stable up to 40 degrees C. Recombinant AoTanB was able to release gallic acid from natural substrates, such as (-)-catechin gallate, (-)-epicatechin gallate, (-)-gallochatechin gallate, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate. The enzyme also hydrolyzed ethyl protocatechuate. Meanwhile, no activity was detected toward ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate. The activity of recombinant AoTanB was lower toward natural substrates compared to that of AoTanA from A. oryzae. The lower catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value) toward ethyl protocatechuate was due to a combination of increased Km and considerably decreased kcat. Kinetic analysis of the recombinant AoTanB showed that kcat values toward natural substrates decreased compared to those of recombinant AoTanA. Therefore, recombinant AoTanB showed a decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value) compared to recombinant AoTanA was due to considerably lower kcat value.</p></details></div>

Only a few microorganisms are industrially relevant for recombinant protein production: methylotrophic yeasts are known to use methanol efficiently as the sole carbon and energy source. Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast characterized as being an economical, fast and effective system for heterologous protein expression. Many factors can affect both the product and the production, including the promoter, carbon source, pH, production volume, temperature, and many others; but to control all of them most of the time is difficult and this depends on the initial selection of each variable. Therefore, this review focuses on the selection of the best promoter in the recombination process, considering different inductors, and the temperature as a culture medium variable in methylotrophic Pichia pastoris yeast. The goal is to understand the effects associated with different factors that influence its cell metabolism and to reach the construction of an expression system that fulfills the requirements of the yeast, presenting an optimal growth and development in batch, fed-batch or continuous cultures, and at the same time improve its yield in heterologous protein production.</p></details></div>

This work aimed to evaluate the effect of various concentrations of ascorbic acid in mixed feeding strategy with sorbitol/methanol on productivity of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH). The relevant concentration of ascorbic acid (5, 10, or 20 mmol) and 50 g/L sorbitol were added in batch-wise mode to the medium at the beginning of induction phase. The rate of methanol addition was increased stepwise during the first 12 h of production and then kept constant. Total protein and r-hGH concentrations were analyzed and the results compared with sorbitol/methanol feeding using one-way analysis of variance. Moreover, an effective clarification process using activated carbon was developed to remove process contaminants like pigments and endotoxins. Finally, a three-step chromatographic process was applied to purify the product. According to the obtained results, addition of 10 mmol ascorbic acid to sorbitol/methanol co-feeding could significantly increase cell biomass (1.7 fold), total protein (1.14 fold), and r-hGH concentration (1.43 fold). One percent activated carbon could significantly decrease pigments and endotoxins without any significant changes in r-hGH assay. The result of the study concluded that ascorbic acid in combination with sorbitol could effectively enhance the productivity of r-hGH. This study also demonstrated that activated carbon clarification is a simple method for efficient removal of endotoxin and pigment in production of recombinant protein in the yeast expression system.</p></details></div>

CTendo7 belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 7, and exhibited considerable activity against sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) and xylan of 1.91IU/mg and 3.05IU/mg at the optimum reaction condition of 55 degrees C, pH5.0, respectively. The purified enzyme displayed relatively good thermostability. The residual endoglucanase and xylanase activities were 74.3% and 66.2% after a 60min pre-incubation at 70 degrees C. Additionally, Ag(+), Fe(3+) and Cu(2+) negatively affected the enzyme's activity, while the presence of 1mM and 5mM Mn(2+) significantly enhanced both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. Generation of soluble oligosaccharides from lignocellulose is a critical step in bioethanol production, and it is noteworthy that CTendo7 produced cello-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides from the continuous enzymatic saccharification of CMC-Na and xylan, respectively.

Circular plasmids containing the P. pastoris-specific autonomously replicating sequence (PARS1) permits transformation of P. pastoris with higher efficiency than obtained following chromosomal integration by linearized DNA. Unfortunately, however, existing autonomously replicating plasmids are known to be inherently unstable. In this study, we used RNA-seq data and genome sequence information to independently identify, on each of the four chromosomes, centromeric DNA sequences consisting of long inverted repeat sequences. By examining the chromosome-2 centromeric DNA sequence (Cen2) in detail, we demonstrate that an approximately 111-bp region located at one end of the putative centromeric sequence had autonomous replication activity. In addition, the full-length Cen2 sequence, which contains two long inverted repeat sequences and a non-repetitive central core region, is needed for the accurate replication and distribution of plasmids in P. pastoris Thus, we constructed a new stable, autonomously replicating plasmid vector that harbors the entire Cen2 sequence; this episome facilitates genetic manipulation in P. pastoris, providing high transformation efficiency and plasmid stability.Importance Secretory production of recombinant proteins is the most important application of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, a species that permits mass production of heterologous proteins. To date, the genetic engineering of P. pastoris has relied largely on integrative vectors due to the lack of user-friendly tools. Autonomously replicating Pichia plasmids are expected to facilitate genetic manipulation; however, the existing systems, which use autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) such as the P. pastoris-specific ARS (PARS1), are known to be inherently unstable for plasmid replication and distribution. Recently, the centromeric DNA sequences of P. pastoris were identified in back-to-back studies published by several groups; therefore, it is now in the state of readiness to develop a new episomal plasmid vector with centromere DNA for P. pastoris as the new genetic manipulation tool.</p></details></div>

Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme' active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency.

In particular, members of the Lactobacillaceae family are the primary bacteria of concern. Currently, antibiotics and acid washing are two major means of controlling contaminants. However, antibiotic use could lead to increased antibiotic resistance, and the acid wash step stresses the fermenting yeast and has limited effectiveness. Bacteriophage endolysins such as LysA2 are lytic enzymes with the potential to contribute as antimicrobials to the fuel ethanol industries. Our goal was to evaluate the potential of yeast-derived LysA2 as a means of controlling Lactobacillaceae contamination. LysA2 intracellularly produced by Pichia pastoris showed activity comparable to Escherichia coli produced LysA2. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) with the A4alpha peptidoglycan chemotype (L-Lys-D-Asp crosslinkage) were the most sensitive to LysA2, though a few from that chemotype were insensitive. Pichia-expressed LysA2, both secreted and intracellularly produced, successfully improved ethanol productivity and yields in glucose (YPD60) and sucrose-based (sugarcane juice) ethanol fermentations in the presence of a LysA2 susceptible LAB contaminant. LysA2 secreting Sacharomyces cerevisiae did not notably improve production in sugarcane juice, but it did control bacterial contamination during fermentation in YPD60. Secretion of LysA2 by the fermenting yeast, or adding it in purified form, are promising alternative tools to control LAB contamination during ethanol fermentation. Endolysins with much broader lytic spectrums than LysA2 could supplement or replace the currently used antibiotics or the acidic wash.</p></details></div>

In particular, the enzyme had a unique catalytic efficiency on beta-1,4-glucans rather than mixed beta-1,3/1,4-glucans as compared to other GH45 endoglucanases. The fungal enzyme was relatively thermostable, retaining more than 91.4% activity at 80 degrees C for 1 h.

It has, however, recently been revealed that the systemic reaction in peach-allergic patients is related not only to LTP (Pru p 3) but also to gibberellin-regulated protein (Pru p 7). We investigated recombinant Pru p 7 (rPru p 7) for its potential use in worldwide standardization for the diagnosis of peach allergy.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> Natural Pru p 7 (nPru p 7) was purified from peach crude extract using a monoclonal antibody affinity column. Complementary DNA for Pru p 7 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E in peach-allergic patients was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using nPru p 7 and rPru p 7 (E. coli product: erPru p 7 and P. pastoris product: prPru p 7).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Peach-allergic patients (n=27) were diagnosed and categorized into oral reaction (n=10) or systemic reaction (n=17). The nPru p 7 positivity based on serum IgE levels was 52% in the systemic-reaction group and 0% in the oral-reaction group (P<0.05). In the systemic-reaction group, there was no significant difference in reactivity between nPru p 7 and prPru p 7, but the reactivity of erPru p 7 was significantly lower than those of nPru p 7 and prPru p 7 (P<0.05).</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We found that prPru p 7 exhibited reactivity in ELISA comparable to that of nPru p 7 for the diagnosis of peach allergy with systemic reaction.</p></details></div>

Nevertheless, low performance in the extreme environment severely prevents the utilization of commercial enzyme preparations. To obtain cellobiohydrolases with improved catalytic activity and thermostability, structure-based rational design was performed based on a thermostable cellobiohydrolase CtCel6 from Chaetomium thermophilum. In the present study, four conserved and noncatalytic residue substitutions were generated via site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were heterologously expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris, purified, and ultimately assayed for enzymatic characteristics. The mutant Y119F increased the catalytic activity 1.82-, 1.65- and 1.43-fold against beta-d-glucan, phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) and carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na), respectively. In addition, S131W effectively enhanced the enzyme's heat resistance to elevated temperatures. The half-life (t1/2) of this mutant enzyme was increased 1.42- and 2.40-fold at 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C, respectively, compared to the wild-type. This study offers initial insight into the biological function of the conserved and noncatalytic residues of thermostable cellobiohydrolases and provides a valid approach to the improvement of enzyme redesign proposal.</p></details></div>

The O-mannosylation is essential for its biological function in the process of colonization and invasion of host cells by M. tuberculosis. In this work, the gene encoding Apa was cloned from M. tuberculosis and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. In shake-flasks, the recombinant Apa was secreted into the culture media and purified with a yield of 0.6g/L. Both N- and O-glycans were found in recombinant Apa. In P. pastoris the known M. tuberculosis-derived O-glycosites of Apa were modified with short chains of mannose units, and a few additional glycosylation sites were also observed. Therefore, the recombinant Apa expressed in P. pastoris has similar but not identical O-mannose patterns to the native protein from M. tuberculosis. P. pastoris and mycobacteria share similarities in the protein O-glycosylation pathway. Thus P. pastoris could be a potential powerful expression system to produce mycobacteria-derived glycoproteins.</p></details></div>

This was the highest yield record of recombinant expression of alginate lyase so far. The rSAGL was confirmed as a partially glycosylated protein through EndoH digestion. The optimal reaction temperature and pH of this enzyme were 45 degrees C and 7.5; 80 mM K(+) ions could improve the catalytic activity of the enzyme by 244% at most. rSAGL was a thermal stable enzyme with T50(15) of 57(-)58 degrees C and T50(30) of 53(-)54 degrees C. Its thermal stability was better than any known alginate lyase. In 100 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6.0, rSAGL could retain 98.8% of the initial activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for 2 h. Furthermore, it could retain 61.6% of the initial activity after 48 h.

Progressively decreasing the size of the N-linked N297 oligosaccharide from high mannose (Man8-Man12), to Man5, to GlcNAc, to non-glycosylated N297Q resulted in progressive increases in backbone flexibility. Comparison of these results with recently published physicochemical stability and Fcgamma receptor binding data with the same set of glycoproteins provide improved insights into correlations between glycan structure and these pharmaceutical properties. Flexibility significantly increased upon glycan truncation in two potential aggregation prone regions. In addition, a correlation was established between increased local backbone flexibility and increased deamidation at asparagine 315. Interestingly, the opposite trend was observed for oxidation of tryptophan 277 where faster oxidation correlated with decreased local backbone flexibility. Finally, a trend of increasing C'E glycopeptide loop flexibility with decreasing glycan size was observed that correlates with their FcgammaRIIIa receptor binding properties. These well-defined IgG1-Fc glycoforms serve as a useful model system to identify physicochemical stability and local backbone flexibility data sets potentially discriminating between various IgG glycoforms for potential applicability to future comparability or biosimilarity assessments.</p></details></div>

Microplates and shake flasks are massively employed during screenings and early phases of bioprocess development, although major drawbacks such as low oxygen transfer rates are well documented. In recent years, miniaturization and parallelization of stirred and shaken bioreactor concepts have led to the development of novel microbioreactor concepts. They combine high cultivation throughput with reproducibility and scalability, and represent promising tools for bioprocess development. Results: Parallelized microplate cultivation of the eukaryotic protein production host Pichia pastoris was applied effectively to support miniaturized phenotyping of clonal libraries in batch as well as fed-batch mode. By tailoring a chemically defined growth medium, we show that growth conditions are scalable from microliter to 0.8 L lab-scale bioreactor batch cultivation with different carbon sources. Thus, the set-up allows for a rapid physiological comparison and preselection of promising clones based on online data and simple offline analytics. This is exemplified by screening a clonal library of P. pastoris constitutively expressing AppA phytase from Escherichia coli. The protocol was further modified to establish carbon-limited conditions by employing enzymatic substrate-release to achieve screening conditions relevant for later protein production processes in fed-batch mode. Conclusion: The comparison of clonal rankings under batch and fed-batch-like conditions emphasizes the necessity to perform screenings under process-relevant conditions. Increased biomass and product concentrations achieved after fed-batch microscale cultivation facilitates the selection of top producers. By reducing the demand to conduct laborious and cost-intensive lab-scale bioreactor cultivations during process development, this study will contribute to an accelerated development of protein production processes.</p></details></div>

It has been reported that Legumain is highly expressed in many human tumors and promotes the migratory and invasive activity of cancer cells. Due to the limitation of an abundant and affordable source of endogenous active Legumain for further function studies, we produced the recombinant protein in Pichia pastoris. The pPICZalpha-LGMN expression plasmid was constructed and transformed into Pichia pastoris strain and positive recombinants were identified. Fermentation conditions were optimized and it was found that Legumain was most highly expressed under pH 6 culture conditions. In addition, the enzyme activity of the purified Legumain was tested using a fluorogenic substrate (Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC) assay and the optimum pH for the autocatalytic activation of recombinant Legumain was very acidic at a pH value of 3. The recombinant protein was then used to screen a library of compounds and small molecule 1773 (Terramycin) was shown to effectively inhibit Legumain enzyme activity.

Both EpXYN1 and EpXYN3 were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant enzymes were characterized using beechwood xylan, birchwood xylan, or oat spelt xylan as substrates, respectively. The optimum temperatures and pH values were 75 degrees C and 5.5 for EpXYN1, and 55 degrees C and 5.0 for EpXYN3. EpXYN1 exhibited a high stability at high temperature (65 degrees C) or at pH values from 8 to 10. EpXYN3 kept over 80% enzymatic activity after treatment at pH values from 3 to 10. The specific activities of EpXYN1 and EpXYN3 were 384.42 and 214.20 U/mg using beechwood xylan as substrate, respectively. EpXYN1 showed lower Km values and higher specific activities toward different xylans compared to EpXYN3. Thin-layer chromatography analysis indicated that the hydrolysis profiles of xylans or xylo-oligosacharides were different by EpXYN1and EpXYN3. EpXYN3 had a higher efficiency than EpXYN1 in production of feruloylated oligosaccharides (FOs) from de-starched wheat bran. The maximum levels of FOs released by EpXYN1 and EpXYN3 were 11.1 and 14.4 mumol/g, respectively.

In the present study, a cysteine-rich motif associated immunoglobulin domain containing protein (designated CgCAICP-1) was identified in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The deduced protein sequence of CgCAICP-1 contained 534 amino acidresidues, with three Ig domains which were designated as IG1, IG2 and IG3, and a cysteine-rich motif between the first and second Ig domain. The mRNA transcripts of CgCAICP-1 were highly expressed in hemocytes and up-regulated significantly (p<0.05) after the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), but not peptidoglycan (PGN). The recombinant CgCAICP-1 protein (rCgCAICP-1) exhibited binding activity to various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including LPS, PGN, mannose (Man) and D-galactose (D-Gal), and microorganisms including Vibrio splendidus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The phagocytic rates of oyster hemocytes towards Gram-negative bacteria V. splendidus and Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus were significantly enhanced (p<0.05) after pre-incubation of microbes with rCgCAICP-1. Furthermore, the transcripts of CgCAICP-1 exhibited high level of polymorphism among individuals. The ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances (dN/dS) for AA'BCC'D strands of IG1 (the possible binding sites 1, pbs1) across all allelic variants was 2.09 (p<0.05), while the ratio for the non-pbs regions was less than 1.0. The 1248 bp fragment amplified from the 5' end of CgCAICP-1 open reading frame (ORF) from 24 transcript variants could be divided artificially into seven regions of 50 elements, and all of the allelic variants might be derived from these elements by point mutation and recombination processes. These results collectively suggested that CgCAICP-1 might function as an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to recognize various PAMPs and facilitated the phagocytosis of oyster hemocytes towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Diverse isoforms of CgCAICP-1 were generated through point mutation and recombination processes and maintained by balancing selection, which would provide a broader spectrum of interaction surface and be associated with immune resistance of oysters to infectious pathogens.</p></details></div>

The alpha-subunit of Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) is the main structural element of this channel. Tetramerization of KCNQ1 in the membrane results in formation of an ion channel, which comprises a pore and four voltage-sensing domains. Mutations in the human KCNQ1 gene are one of the major causes of inherited arrhythmias, long QT syndrome in particular. The construct encoding full-length human KCNQ1 protein was synthesized in this work, and an expression system in the Pichia pastoris yeast cells was developed. The membrane fraction of the yeast cells containing the recombinant protein (rKCNQ1) was solubilized with CHAPS detergent. To better mimic the lipid environment of the channel, lipid-protein nanodiscs were formed using solubilized membrane fraction and MSP2N2 protein. The rKCNQ1/nanodisc and rKCNQ1/CHAPS samples were purified using the Rho1D4 tag introduced at the C-terminus of the protein. Protein samples were examined using transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. In both cases, homogeneous rKCNQ1 samples were observed based on image analysis. Statistical analysis of the images of individual protein particles solubilized in the detergent revealed the presence of a tetrameric structure confirming intact subunit assembly. A three-dimensional channel structure reconstructed at 2.5-nm resolution represents a compact density with diameter of the membrane part of ~9 nm and height ~11 nm. Analysis of the images of rKCNQ1 in nanodiscs revealed additional electron density corresponding to the lipid bilayer fragment and the MSP2N2 protein.

Gcw13, one of these GPI-anchored proteins, was found to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of the histidine auxotrophic P. pastoris strain GS115 on methanol as the sole carbon source. To investigate the biological function of Gcw13, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to compare the difference of gene expression between GS115 and GCW13-deletion strain D13. RNA-Seq analysis showed that, in strain D13, the expression of genes involved in the methanol utilization pathway or peroxisome biogenesis was not changed, and a high proportion of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids were down-regulated, whereas GAP1, which encodes a general amino acid permease, was significantly up-regulated. Besides, the intracellular concentrations of various amino acids were significantly higher in D13 than that in GS115. We also observed that deletion of GCW13 resulted in more Gap1 presented on the cell surface and more active uptake of the toxic proline analogue l-azetidine-2-carboxylate acid (AzC). These results suggest that Gcw13 suppresses the expression of GAP1 and facilitates the endocytosis of Gap1 on methanol, resulting in decreasing Gap1-dependent uptake of amino acids in P. pastoris, which might contribute to the poor growth of GS115 on methanol.</p></details></div>

This is a novel fungal P450 enzyme with 19-hydroxylase activity, which is different from the known steroidal aromatase CYP19 and CYP11B families of enzymes.IMPORTANCE Hydroxylation is one of the most important reactions in steroid functionalization, especially C19-hydroxylation produces a key intermediate for the synthesis of 19-nor-steroid drugs without C19 angular methyl group in three chemo-enzymatic steps, instead of the current industrial process with ten chemical reactions. However, hydroxylation of the C19 angular methyl group remains a very challenging task due to the large steric resistance to the 19 methyl group between the A and B rings. The present study reports a novel fungal P450 enzyme with 19-hydroxylase activity. This opens a new venue for searching effective biocatalysts for the useful steroidal C-19 hydroxylation, although further studies for better understanding of the structural basis underlying regioselectivity and substrate specificity of this fungal steroidal 19-hydroxylase is warranted to facilitate the engineering of this enzyme for the industrial applications.</p></details></div>

Unfortunately, most model systems typically lack expression of a conspecific NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is the electron transfer partner of CYPs. As a result, the activities of heterologously expressed insect CYPs may not accurately reflect detoxification activities in vivo. Previously, CYP6B7 from Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (HaCYP6B7) has been expressed in the Pichia pastoris GS115 strain and shown to detoxify bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos. However, it remains to be determined if co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with HaCPR will enhance the detoxification ability of the expression system. In the present study, HaCYP6B7 and HaCPR genes were co-expressed in P. pastoris using a reconstituted expression vector, pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-HaCPR. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot, and the detoxification activities of microsomal fractions to p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (PNOD), 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD), fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos were measured. Co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with HaCPR resulted in PNOD and ECOD activities of 1.90 nmol/min/mg.protein and 12.39 pmol/min/mg.protein, which were 1.6- and 1.5-fold of that catalyzed by HaCYP6B7 expressed alone, respectively. Furthermore, microsomes of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-HaCPR-GS115 had higher detoxification activity than that of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-GS115 to fenvalerate, but not chlorpyrifos. The results indicated that co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with conspecific CPR could enhance the detoxification activities to some substrates comparing with expression of HaCYP6B7 alone.</p></details></div>

But recently, 3G biofuels, based in algae biomass, have emerged as a great alternative for production of energy. Results: In this work, a versatile beta-glucosidase from the ascomycete fungus Talaromyces amestolkiae has been purified, characterized, and heterologously expressed. The synthesis of this beta-glucosidase (BGL-3) was not induced by cellulose, and the presence of a specific carbon source is not required for its production, which is uncommon for beta-glucosidases. BGL-3, which was obtained from a basal medium with glucose as carbon source, was profusely secreted under carbon starvation conditions, which was corroborated by qRT-PCR assays. BGL-3 was purified from T. amestolkiae cultures in one step, and biochemically characterized. The enzyme showed high thermal stability, and very high efficiency on pNPG (Km of 0.14 mM and Vmax of 381.1 U/mg), cellobiose (Km of 0.48 mM and Vmax of 447.1 U/mg), and other cello-oligosaccharides. Surprisingly, it also showed remarkable ability to hydrolyze laminarin, a beta-1,3-glucan present in algae. The recombinant enzyme, obtained in the yeast Pichia pastoris, exhibited kinetic and physicochemical properties similar to those found for the native protein. Enzyme efficiency was examined in wheat straw saccharification processes, in which BGL-3 worked better supplementing Celluclast 1.5L than the commercial cellulase cocktail N-50010. Besides, BGL-3 hydrolyzed laminarin more efficiently than a commercial laminarinase. Conclusions: A very efficient 1,4-beta-glucosidase, which also showed activity over 1,3-beta-glucose bonds, has been produced, purified, and characterized. This is the first report of such versatility in a 1,4-beta-glucosidase. The application of this enzyme for saccharification of wheat straw and laminarin and its comparison with commercial enzymes suggest that it could be an interesting tool for the production of 2G and 3G biofuels.</p></details></div>

As nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce, cellulose is expected to become a major raw material for food, energy, fuel and other products. 1,4-beta-glucosidase (Bgl), as a kind of cellulose, can be degraded cellulose into industrial available glucose. In this study, we constructed mutants of Bgl with enhanced activity based on homology modeling, molecular docking, and the site-directed mutagenesis of target residues to modify spatial positions, steric hindrances, or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. On the basis of the high-activity mutations were got (N347S and G235M) by using site-directed mutagenesis and screening methods and introduced in the Pichia pastoris expression system, the enzymatic properties of mutant enzymes were analysed. Assays of the activity of the purified Bgl revealed that the two mutants exhibited increased activity. The pPICZalphaA-G235M and pPICZalphaA-N347S mutants exhibited a >33.4% and 44.8% increase in specific activity respectively, with similar pH, temperature and metal ion requirements, compared to wild-type Bgl. These findings would be good foundation for improving production properties of Bgl in the future.</p></details></div>

Despite two prophylactic vaccines being commercially available, they are unaffordable for most women in developing countries. We compared the optimized expression of monomers of the unique HPV type 16 L1-L2 chimeric protein (SAF) in two yeast strains of Pichia pastoris, KM71 (Mut(s) ) and GS115 (Mut(+) ), with Hansenula polymorpha NCYC 495 to determine the preferred host in bioreactors. SAF was uniquely created by replacing the h4 helix of the HPV-16 capsid L1 protein with an L2 peptide. Two different feeding strategies in fed-batch cultures of P. pastoris Mut(s) were evaluated: a predetermined feed rate vs. feeding based on the oxygen consumption by maintaining constant dissolved oxygen levels (DO stat). All cultures showed a significant increase in biomass when methanol was fed using the DO stat method. In P. pastoris the SAF concentrations were higher in the Mut(s) strains than in the Mut(+) strains. However, H. polymorpha produced the highest level of SAF at 132.10 mg L(-1) culture while P. pastoris Mut(s) only produced 23.61 mg L(-1) . H. polymorpha showed greater potential for the expression of HPV-16 L1/L2 chimeric proteins despite the track record of P. pastoris as a high-level producer of heterologous proteins.</p></details></div>

In this work, we developed a tailored method for profiling and quantification combining (1) isotope dilution, (2) enhanced isomer separation by C30 fused-core reversed-phase material, and (3) parallel Orbitrap and ion trap detection by the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid mass spectrometer. The combination of parallelizable ion analysis without time loss together with different fragmentation techniques (HCD/CID) and an inclusion list led to higher quality in lipid identifications exemplified in human plasma and yeast samples. Moreover, we used lipidome isotope-labeling of yeast (LILY)-a fast and efficient in vivo labeling strategy in Pichia pastoris-to produce (nonradioactive) isotopically labeled eukaryotic lipid standards in yeast. We integrated the (13)C lipids in the LC-MS workflow to enable relative and absolute compound-specific quantification in yeast and human plasma samples by isotope dilution. Label-free and compound-specific quantification was validated by comparison against a recent international interlaboratory study on human plasma SRM 1950. In this way, we were able to prove that LILY enabled quantification leads to accurate results, even in complex matrices. Excellent analytical figures of merit with enhanced trueness, precision and linearity over 4-5 orders of magnitude were observed applying compound-specific quantification with (13)C-labeled lipids. We strongly believe that lipidomics studies will benefit from incorporating isotope dilution and LC-MSn strategies.</p></details></div>

Golgins are large Golgi-resident proteins, primarily reported to play role in cargo vesicle capture, but details of such mechanisms are yet to be deciphered. Golgins that localize to the Golgi via their GRIP domain, a C-terminal Golgi anchoring domain, are known as GRIP domain Golgins. In this present study, we have identified and functionally characterized a homologue of one such GRIP domain Golgin protein, Imh1, from the budding yeast P. pastoris. We have demonstrated that the GRIP domain present at the C-terminal of P. pastoris Imh1 (PpImh1) functions as its Golgi-targeting sequence. Using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy, we have shown that PpImh1 can self-associate and form a homodimer. Analysis of purified recombinant PpImh1 by CD spectroscopy indicates the presence of an 85% alpha-helical structure, a characteristic of high-content alpha-helical coiled-coil sequences normally present in other Golgin family proteins. Two-hybrid analysis indicated self-interaction between C-terminal fragments, yet N-terminal fragments do not mediate any such form of self-interaction, suggesting that PpImh1 may form a parallel dimer. Electron microscopy data indicates that PpImh1 forms extended rod-like homo-dimeric molecules with splayed N-terminal end which can act as a tether for capturing vesicles. Our study provides the first evidence in support of the dimeric Y-shaped structure for any Golgin in the budding yeast.</p></details></div>

However, little is known about the FIPs from G. applanatum. In this study, two novel FIP genes, termed as FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2, were cloned from G. applanatum, characterized and functionally expressed after codon optimization in Pichia pastoris GS115. Results showed that FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2 comprised 342-bp encoding peptides of 113 amino acids, which shared a high homology with other Ganoderma FIPs. The yield of recombinant FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2 increased significantly after codon optimization and reached 247.4 and 197.5 mg/L, respectively. Bioactivity assay in vitro revealed that both rFIP-gap1 and rFIP-gap2 could agglutinate mouse, sheep, and human red blood cells. Besides, rFIP-gap1 and rFIP-gap2 obviously stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenocytes and enhanced IL-2 and IFN-gamma release. Cytotoxicity detection indicated that IC50 of rFIP-gap1 towards A549 and HeLa cancer cells were 29.89 and 8.34 mug/mL, respectively, whereas IC50 of rFIP-gap2 to the same cancer cells were 60.92 and 41.05 mug/mL, respectively. Taken together, novel FIP gaps were cloned and functionally expressed in P. pastoris, which can serve as feasible and stable resources of rFIP gaps for further studies and potential applications.</p></details></div>

For example, methanol can be metabolized by other pathways to produce ethanol, which acts as an inhibitor of the heterologous protein production pathway; oxygen concentration can generate aerobic or anaerobic environments and affects the fermentation rate; and temperature affects the central carbon metabolism and stress response protein folding. The main goal of this study was determine the implication of free fatty acids on the production of heterologous proteins in different culture conditions in cultures of Pichia pastoris. We evaluated cell viability using propidium iodide by flow cytometry and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances to measure cell membrane damage. The results indicate that the use of low temperatures and low methanol concentrations favors the decrease in lipid peroxidation in the transition phase from glycerol to methanol. In addition, a temperature of 14 degrees C+1%M provided the most stable viability. By contrast, the temperature of 18 degrees C+1.5%M favored the production of a higher antibody fragment concentration. In summary, these results demonstrate that the decrease in lipid peroxidation is related to an increased production of free fatty acids.</p></details></div>

Efficient methods to insert, modify or delete genes via homologous recombination and CRISPR/Cas9, supported by modular cloning techniques, have been reported. An outstanding early example of metabolic engineering in P. pastoris was the humanization of protein glycosylation. More recently the cell metabolism was engineered also to enhance the productivity of heterologous proteins. The last few years have seen an increased number of metabolic pathway design and engineering in P. pastoris, mainly towards the production of complex (secondary) metabolites.

To overcome this disadvantage, in this study, we constructed an rhIFN-lambda1 mutant (rhIFN-lambda1-Nm) devoid of the potential N-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. rhIFN-lambda1-Nm was successfully expressed and secreted extracellularly in P. pastoris (GS115) using methanol inducible AOX1 promoter with alpha-mating factor signal sequence. rhIFN-lambda1-Nm was purified and characterized. There was no significant difference between rhIFN-lambda1-Nm and rhIFN-lambda1 in structure and bioactivity. The molecular weight was low after N-glycosylation mutation whereas the glycosylation was much lower.

The recombinant plasmid was expressed under the induction of methanol. The expressed products in the medium of the cells were purified and identified with endoglycosidase digestion assay and western blot mediated with monoclonal antibody (MAb) JE9. The purified product combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant was inoculated intramuscularly into 7-day-old chickens and three booster inoculations were performed on 21 days post first inoculation (dpfi), 42, and 56 dpfi. The antibody responses and cellular immune responses were detected, and the protective effects were analyzed after challenge with ALV-J. The results showed that the secretory pPIC9-gp85 plasmid was successfully constructed and could be stably expressed in GS115 cells. The expressed products were N-acetylglucosylated and could specifically combine with MAb (JE9). The secreted gp85 protein combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could induce higher antibody response and spleen lymphocyte proliferation response and IFN-gamma-inducing response, and could protect all the inoculated chickens against the viremia and the immunosuppressive lesions caused by ALV-J challenge. The results of neutralizing test in vitro suggested that the antisera with some ALV-J antibody titers could neutralize ALV-J strain and inhibit the growth of virus in vitro. The result of IFA showed that IgG antibody in the antisera could specifically combine with ALV-J strain in cells. It can be concluded that the secretory recombinant gp85 protein, as a new acetylglucosylated gp85 protein, was successfully prepared and combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could protect the inoculated chickens against ALV-J infection.

Application of lignin degrading enzymes on the lignocellulosic biomass exposes the cellulose for easy digestion by ruminants. Laccases have been found to be considerably effective in improving the digestibility by way of delignification. However, laccase yields from natural hosts are not sufficient for industrial scale applications, which restricts their use. A viable option would be to express the laccase gene in compatible hosts to achieve higher production yields. A codon-optimized synthetic variant of Schizophyllum commune laccase gene was cloned into a pPIC9K vector and expressed in P. pastoris GS115 (his4) under the control of an alcohol oxidase promoter. Colonies were screened for G418 resistance and the methanol utilization phenotype was established. The transformant yielded a laccase activity of 344 U.mL(-1) after 5 days of growth at 30 degrees C (0.019 g.mL(-1) wet cell weight). The laccase protein produced by the recombinant Pichia clone was detected as two bands with apparent molecular weights of 55 kDa and 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Activity staining on native PAGE confirmed the presence of bioactive laccase. Treatment of five common crop residues with recombinant laccase recorded a lignin loss ranging between 1.64% in sorghum stover, to 4.83% in finger millet, with an enhancement in digestibility ranging between 8.71% in maize straw to 24.61% in finger millet straw. Treatment with recombinant laccase was effective in enhancing the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass for ruminant feeding through delignification. To date, a number of hosts have been adventured to produce laccase in large quantities, but, to our knowledge, there are no reports of the expression of laccase protein from Schizophyllum commune in Pichia pastoris, and also on the treatment of crop residues using recombinant laccase for ruminant feeding.</p></details></div>

This study is an assessment of the humanized Fab fragment ACT017 produced from two microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris) and one mammalian cell host (CHO). Following low scale production and Protein L-affinity purification under generic conditions, physico-chemical and functional quality assessments were carried out prior to economic analysis of industrial scale production using a specialized software (Biosolve, Biopharm Services, UK). Results show higher titer production when using E. coli but associated with high heterogeneity of the protein content recovered in the supernatant.

To study the effects of N-glycosylation on the biochemical properties of bEKL, the enzyme was deglycosylated via site-directed mutagenesis. The results showed that elimination of the N-glycosylation sites of bEKL (N64, N103 and N165) did not significantly affect the protein secretion level in P. pastoris, but it does greatly influence its enzymatic activity. The N64Q increased the specific activity of the enzyme for GD4K-beta-naphthylamide and improved its catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the glycosylated bEKL is more thermostable than its deglycosylated counterparts. Structural analysis of glycosylated and deglycosylated bEKL revealed that the removal of N-glycosylation did not have pronounced changes on the secondary structure but there was a significant difference in the tertiary structure. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the effects of glycosylation at different degrees and sites in bEKL were diverse.

And hence it would not be surprised why their power is so limited. To grasp the CG asymmetry feature and make the prediction able to cover the entire replication regions of yeast species, we develop a new predictor called "iRO-3wPseKNC". Results: Rigorous cross-validations on the benchmark datasets from four yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Pichia pastoris) have indicated that the proposed predictor is really very powerful for predicting the entire DNA duplication origins. Availability and implementation: The web-server for the iRO-3wPseKNC predictor is available at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iRO-3wPseKNC/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

The unique GH5 cellulase candidate from A. glaucus, an endoglucanase termed as AgCMCase, was cloned, expressed in the Pichia pastoris system and the purified enzyme was characterized. A large amount of recombinant enzyme secreted by the P. pastoris GS115 strain was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the purified endoglucanase is about 55.0 kDa. The AgCMCase exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. However, it remained relatively stable at temperatures ranging from 45 to 80 degrees C and pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0. In addition, it showed higher activity at extreme NaCl concentrations from 1.0 to 4.0 M, suggesting it is an enzyme highly stable under heat, acid, alkaline and saline conditions. To evaluate the catalytic activity of AgCMCase, the hydrolysis products of rice and corn straws were successfully studied. In conclusion, the AgCMCase is a thermostable and salt-tolerant cellulase with potential for industrial application.</p></details></div>

The increased need for phosphate, the decrease of long-chain polyP level, the accumulation of short-chain polyP, and enhanced endopolyphosphatase activity in the crude membrane fraction were observed in methanol-grown cells compared with glucose-grown cells of both species. Transcriptome analysis revealed notable differences in the expression patterns of key genes encoding proteins related to polyP metabolism. In methanol-grown cells, the genes encoding endopolyphosphatases and phosphate transporters were upregulated.

A one-time characterization of process-related impurities from product expression in Pichia pastoris was first carried out using linear salt and pH gradients on a library of multimodal, salt-tolerant, and hydrophobic charge induction chromatographic resins. The Reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis of the fractions from these gradients was then used to generate large data sets of impurity profiles. A retention database of the biological product was also generated using the same linear salt and pH gradients on these resins, without fraction collection. The resulting two data sets were then analyzed using an in silico tool, which incorporated integrated manufacturing constraints to generate and rank potential three-step purification sequences based on their predicted purification performance as well as whole-process "orthogonality" for impurity removal. Highly ranked sequences were further examined to identify templates for process development. The efficacy of this approach was successfully demonstrated for the rapid development of robust integrated processes for human growth hormone and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.</p></details></div>

To meet the demands for considerable amount of highly pure BLIP, this study aimed at developing an efficient expression system in eukaryotic Pichia pastoris (a methylotrophic yeast) for production of BLIP. With methanol induction, recombinant BLIP was overexpressed in P. pastoris X-33 and secreted into the culture medium. A high yield of ~ 300 mg/L culture secretory BLIP recovered from the culture supernatant without purification was found to be > 90% purity. The recombinant BLIP was fully active and showed an inhibition constant (Ki) for TEM-1 beta-lactamase (0.55 +/- 0.07 nM) comparable to that of the native S. clavuligerus-expressed BLIP (0.5 nM). Yeast-produced BLIP in combination with ampicillin effectively inhibited the growth of beta-lactamase-producing Gram-positive Bacillus. Our approach of expressing secretory BLIP in P. pastoris gave 71- to 1200-fold more BLIP with high purity than the other conventional methods, allowing efficient production of large amount of highly pure BLIP, which merits fundamental science studies, drug development and biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

In the present study, single- and four-CRD-containing galectins were identified in oyster Crassostrea gigas (designated CgGal-2 and CgGal-3). The open reading frames (ORFs) of CgGal-2 and CgGal-3 encode polypeptides of 200 and 555 amino acids, respectively. All CRDs of CgGal-3 include two consensus motifs essential for ligand-binding, and a novel motif is present in CgGal-2. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) profiles were determined for recombinant rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3, and rCgGal-2 displayed low binding affinity for PAMPs, while rCgGal-3 bound various PAMPs including glucan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and peptidoglycan (PGN) with relatively high affinity. Furthermore, rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3 exhibited different microbe binding profiles; rCgGal-2 bound to Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Vibrio vulnificus) and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), while rCgGal-3 bound to these microbes but also to Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus). In addition, rCgGal-3 possessed microbial agglutinating activity and coagulation activity against fungi and erythrocytes, respectively, but rCgGal-2 lacked any agglutinating activity. Carbohydrate binding specificity analysis showed that rCgGal-3 specifically bound D-galactose. Furthermore, rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3 functioned as opsonin participating in the clearance against invaders in C. gigas. Thus, CgGal-2 with one CRD and CgGal-3 with four CRDs are new members of the galectin family involved in immune responses against bacterial infection. Differences in the organisation and amino acid sequences of CRDs may affect their specificity and affinity for nonself substances.</p></details></div>

Purified recombinant phytase displayed all its biochemical properties similar to wild type. Molecular modeling and docking of phytase with various substrates showed differential binding patterns with GoldScore values ranging from 40.61 to 79.78. Docking with different substrates revealed strong binding affinity with ATP and phytic acid, while the lowest with AMP and phosphoenol pyruvate. This was further confirmed using biochemical assays, as the recombinant enzyme displayed broad substrate specificity. Docking with inhibitors also showed differential binding with GoldScore values ranging from 22.94 (2,3-butanedione) to 85.72 (myo-inositol hexasulphate). Validation using biochemical analysis revealed that both 2,3-butanedione and phenyl glyoxal inhibited the phytase activity significantly. Furthermore, presence of inorganic phosphate in the reaction mixture also inhibited the phytase activity, as there was no activity at and beyond 0.8mM. Docking of phytase with metavanadate showed binding at the same atom in the active-site where the substrate i.e. phytic acid binds. Vanadium incorporation resulted in the catalytic conversion of phytase into a peroxidase with concomitant inhibition of phytase activity. Peroxidase activity was high in acidic range and the product formation showed correlation with reaction time. Furthermore, molecular modeling and docking of recombinant HAP-phytase of a thermophilic mould S. thermophile reveals insights into molecular catalysis that is validated by the biochemical properties.</p></details></div>

The limited supply and potential infectious pathogen contamination of pHSA have stimulated the development of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA). However, rHSA often entraps endogenous or exogenous impurities, including color pigments and polysaccharides. Therefore, the purification of rHSA to high purity remains the bottleneck in large-scale production of rHSA. Herein we report a novel two-step purification protocol for rHSA generated from Pichia pastoris. In the first step, rHSA was partially unfolded to expose impurities entrapped into rHSA and was then removed. In the second step, rHSA was crystallized to further remove impurities. Through this procedure, the pigment content (A350/A280) and polysaccharides content of rHSA were reduced to 0.0141 and 0.253mug/mg, respectively, which were comparable to pHSA. In addition, the secondary structure and bioactivity of purified rHSA are preserved. The purification procedure developed in this study is a simple, short and low cost method to produce active rHSA, or rHSA-fusion proteins, to high purity, and also suitable for the purification of other disulfide-rich proteins.</p></details></div>

We report here the cloning and expression of lamprey (l)GpB5, and its ability to heterodimerize with lGpA2 to form a functional l-thyrostimulin. The full-length cDNA of lGpB5 encodes 174 amino acids with ten conserved cysteine residues and one glycosylation site that is conserved with other vertebrate GpB5 sequences. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses support that lGpB5 belongs to the vertebrate GpB5 clade. Heterodimerization of lGpB5 and lGpA2 was shown by nickel pull-down of histidine-tagged recombinant subunits. RNA transcripts of lGpB5 were detected in the pituitary of lampreys during both parasitic and adult life stages. Intraperitoneal injection with lGnRH-III (100mug/kg) increased pituitary lGpA2, lGpB5, and lGpHbeta mRNA expression in sexually mature, adult female lampreys. A recombinant l-thyrostimulin produced by expression of a fusion gene in Pichia pastoris activated lamprey GpH receptors I and II as measured by cAMP enzymeimmunoassay. In contrast to jawed vertebrates that have pituitary LH, FSH, and TSH, our data support that lampreys only have two functional pituitary GpHs, lGpH and l-thyrostimulin, which consist of lGpA2 and unique beta subunits. It is hypothesized that lGpH and l-thyrostimulin differentially regulate reproductive and thyroid activities in some unknown way(s) in lampreys.</p></details></div>

HNP1 plays a crucial role in controlling bacterial infections, particularly by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, through membrane perforation patterns. The structural characteristics of HNP1's three intramolecular disulfide bridges cause difficulty in its synthesis via chemical methods. In this study, bioactive recombinant HNP1 was produced using the Pichia pastoris (P. Pichia) expression system. HNP1 was fused with the polyhedrin of Bombyx mori and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to prevent HNP1 toxicity in yeast host cells under direct expression. An enterokinase protease cleavage site (amino acid sequence DDDDK) was designed upstream of the HNP1 peptide to obtain the antibacterial peptide HNP1 with native structure after it was cleaved by the enterokinase. The fusion HNP1 protein (FHNP1) was successfully expressed and had a molecular mass of approximately 62.6 kDa, as determined using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Then, the recovered FHNP1 was digested and purified; Tricine-SDS-PAGE results showed that HNP1 was successfully released from FHNP1. Functional analysis of induction against antibiotic-resistant Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) showed that it was challenging for HNP1 to acquire resistance to the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori. Moreover, in vitro studies showed that HNP1 exerted a strong effect against antibiotic-resistant H. pylori activity. Furthermore, the animal model of H. pylori infection established in vivo showed that HNP1 significantly reduced the colonization of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori in the stomach. Our study indicated that this could be a new potential avenue for large-scale production of HNP1 for therapeutic application against the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori infection in humans.</p></details></div>

Hence, there is an urgent need to search for new antimicrobial agents. Initially known as a defensive effector in the innate immunity of certain organs of the human body, human goose-type lysozyme 2 (hLysG2) has been shown to possess therapeutically useful potential against multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Developing a novel strategy for large-scale production that provides high yields of this protein with high purity, quality, and potency is critical for pharmaceutical applications. To overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression, here we report the production of recombinant hLysG2 (rhLysG2) using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host. The strong inducible alcoholoxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter was used to drive expression of the optimized hLysG2 gene. Under the optimal expression conditions, the lytic activity of rhLysG2 reached 113 U/mL of culture supernatant in shake flask cultivation and this was increased to 2084 U/mL in fed-batch fermentation. Using chitin affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography, rhLysG2 was produced with a yield of 137mg/L, purity of>99%, molecular weight of 21,504.6Da, and specific activity of 13,500U/mg. In vitro assays indicated that rhLysG2 possessed muramidase activity, isopeptidase activity, and free radical scavenging activity.

However, yeast and plants synthesize different types of N-linked glycan structures and may differ the level of glycosylation at each site. Such non-native glycosylation can have unwanted consequences. Glycosylation site N256 was under-glycosylated in the wild-type (1.5%) compared to the native enzyme (55%); therefore, we mutated WPTP to promote glycosylation at this site (WPTP E254G). Glycosylation increased four-fold, as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mutation did not change the substrate specificity and optimal pH- and thermo-stability ranges, but it increased the catalytic activity 2-3-fold.

As an alternative, several studies have shown the production of active and therapeutic forms of lysosomal proteins in microorganisms. In this paper, we report the production and characterization of a recombinant IDS produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris (prIDS). We evaluated the effect of culture conditions and gene sequence optimization on prIDS production. The results showed that the highest production of prIDS was obtained at oxygen-limited conditions using a codon-optimized IDS cDNA. The purified enzyme showed a final activity of 12.45 nmol mg(-1) H(-1) and an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kDa. The highest stability was achieved at pH 6.0, and prIDS also showed high stability in human serum. Noteworthy, the enzyme was taken up by culture cells in a dose-dependent manner through mannose receptors, which allowed the delivery of the enzyme to the lysosome.

In the present study, a fucolectin was identified from sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (designated AjFL-1). The open reading frame (ORF) of AjFL-1 was of 546 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 181 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 20kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of AjFL-1 shared 30%-40% similarity with the fucolectins from other animals. There were a typical F-type lectin domain (FLD) (residues 39-180) and a signal peptide (residues 1-24) in AjFL-1. The mRNA transcript of AjFL-1 could be detected by qRT-PCR in various tissues, such as intestinum, coelomocytes, respiratory tree, tentacle, and body wall, while undetectable in the gonads and longitudinal muscle. The mRNA expression level of AjFL-1 in coelomocytes was significantly up-regulated (47.06-fold to that in control group, p<0.05) at 12h after Vibrio splendidus challenge. Immunofluorescence assay showed that AjFL-1 protein was mainly distributed on the membrane, while few in cytoplasm of coelomocytes in sea cucumber. The recombinant AjFL-1 (rAjFL-1) could bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), mannan (MAN) and fucose (FUC), and exhibited a broader binding activities towards Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus, as well fungus Pichia pastoris. In addition, rAjFL-1 could strongly promote the agglutination of fungus P. pastoris. These results indicated that AjFL-1 was a novel member of fucose-binding lectin family, which functioned as a pattern recognition receptor with broad spectrum of microbial recognition, and involved in innate immune response of sea cucumber.</p></details></div>

In this work, the peptide ligands were synthesized on Toyopearl chromatographic resins and utilized for purifying recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) from complex sources. Elution buffer pH and composition were optimized to maximize the recovery of standard rHuEPO from the peptide resins. The peptide-based adsorbents were employed for separating rHuEPO from a mixture of albumin, myoglobin, and IgG to examine their selectivity. When using FSLLHH, the inclusion of low amounts of surfactants in the wash and elution buffers facilitated the recovery of rHuEPO with high yield and purity. Specifically, FSLLSH and VVFFVH afforded the most efficient separation of rHuEPO, with yield and purity of 85% and 95-97%, respectively. The affinity resins were also utilized to purify rHuEPO from spiked CHO cell culture fluid. In particular, FSLLSH provided the most successful separation from CHO, with yield and purity above 90%, and 1.0 log10 reduction of host cell proteins. The influence of conductivity and pH in the CHO-rHuEPO load was investigated. Finally, FSLLSH-based resins were used to purify rHuEPO spiked into a Pichia pastoris cell culture fluid, resulting in product yield and purity of 96% and 84%, respectively, and 1.3 log10 reduction of host DNA. These results compare well with values obtained using wheat germ agglutinin agarose and clearly indicate the potential of the cyclic peptide resins as a viable tool for rHuEPO purification.</p></details></div>

Gene database analyses shows that GH62 family only contains specific alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases that play an important role in the degradation and structure of the plant cell wall. At present, there are only 22 enzymes in this group has been characterized. In this study, we cloned a novel alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosidase gene (poabf62a) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 62 from Penicillium oxalicum sp. 68 and expressed it in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of recombinant PoAbf62A was estimated to be 32.9 kDa. Using p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pNPalphaAbf) as substrate, purified PoAbf62A exhibited an optimal pH of 4.5 and temperature of 35 degrees C. Results of methylation and (13)C NMR analyses showed that PoAbf62A was exclusively alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosidase, specific for cleavage of alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues, and with the absence of activity towards alpha-1,2-arabinofuranose and alpha-1,5-arabinofuranose. Therefore, PoAbf62A exhibits high activity on sugar beet arabinan and wheat arabinoxylan, because their branched side chain are decorated with alpha-1,3-arabinofuranose. On the other hand, there is a lack of activity with linear-alpha-L-1,5-arabinan and xylan that only contained alpha-L-1,5-arabinofuranose or beta-1,4-xylose. The alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosidase activity identified here provides a new biocatalytic tool to degrade hemicellulose and analyze the structure of plant cell walls.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a novel Astakine gene was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (designated as EsAst). The full-length cDNA of EsAst was of 1163 bp, consisting of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 120 bp, a 3' UTR of 656 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 387 bp encoding a polypeptide of 128amino acids. There were a signal peptide and a prokineticin domain with nine conserved cysteine residues in the deduced amino acid sequence of EsAst. EsAst shared higher similarity with Astakines from Penaeus monodon and Pacifastacus leniusculus, and it was closely clustered with the Astakine from shrimp P. monodon in the phylogenetic tree. The EsAst mRNA transcript was higher expressed in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was continuously increased from 1.5 to 48h after Vibro anguillarum challenge compared that in the untreated control group. After Pichia pastoris GS115 challenge, the relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was also up-regulated. After rEsAst injection, ROS levels in HPT cells were also increased at 12 and 24h, and the total hemocyte counts were also significantly increased at 6, 9, 12, and 24h post rEsAst injection. The interference of EsAst expression with dsRNA injection could delay the recovery of hemocytes production post A. hydrophila stimulation. When mitochondrial complexes I was knock down by dsRNA, ROS levels were decreased and THCs were also decreased. Recovery of hemocyte production inducing by A. hydrophila stimulation and rEsAst injection were delayed with dsEsbc1 injection. When ROS levels were increased after RNAi of Lon protease, THCs were also increased. The expression levels of five genes (EsJNK, EsSTAT, EsPI3K, EsAKT1, EsP70S6K) involved in SAPK-JNK and mTOR signaling pathways were up-regulated at 12 and 24h in rEsAst group and EsLon dsRNA group compared with that in EGFP dsRNA group, and were similar to the trend of ROS levels.

In this work we examined the combined action of two auxiliary proteins from the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum: a family AA9 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (GtLPMO) and a GH10 xylanase (GtXyn10A). The enzymes were produced in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris. In the presence of an electron source, GtLPMO increased the activity of a commercial cellulase on filter paper, and the xylanase activity of GtXyn10A on beechwood xylan. Mixtures of GtLPMO, GtXyn10A and Celluclast 1.5L were used for hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw. Results showed that a mixture of 60% Celluclast 1.5L, 20% GtXyn10A and 20% GtLPMO increased total reducing sugar production by 54%, while the conversions of glucan to glucose and xylan to xylose were increased by 40 and 57%, respectively. This suggests that GtLPMO can contribute to lignocellulose hydrolysis, not only by oxidative activity on glycosidic bonds, but also to hemicellulose through the oxidation of xylosyl bonds in xylan. The concerted action of these auxiliary enzymes may significantly improve large-scale recovery of sugars from lignocellulose.</p></details></div>

Eleven different signal peptides, including the murine IgG1 signal peptide, were combinatorially evaluated for their effect on antibody titer. Strains using different combinations of signal peptides were identified that secreted approximately 2-7 fold higher levels of VRC01 than the previous best secretor, with the highest yield of 6.50mgL(-1) in shake flask expression. Interestingly it was determined that the highest yields were achieved when the murine IgG1 signal peptide was fused to the light chain, with several different signal peptides leading to high yield when fused to the heavy chain.

Under these conditions, the protease activity of rAp in the fermentation broth reached 400.4+/-40.5 U/mL after induction for three days. The rAp was isolated and purified, and its enzymatic characteristics were tested. Its optimal pH was 10.0, and it remained stable in a pH range of 7.0-10.0. Its optimal temperature was 45 degrees C and it retained >50% activity at 40 degrees C for 60min. The rAp activity was significantly inhibited by PMSF, Zn(2+) and Fe(2+) and the rAp had a broad substrate specificity for natural proteins and synthetic peptide substrates, and preferred substrates at P1 position with large hydrophobic side-chain groups. Compared to Papain (8.7%) and Alcalase (12.2%), the degree of hydrolysis of rAp to soy protein isolate was 16.5%; therefore, rAp was a good candidate for the processing of food industry byproducts.</p></details></div>

Furthermore, OsPNGase A showed higher activity than commercial PNGase F towards avidin. OsPNGase A displayed the highest digestion activity at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C, and was also active in the neutral and alkaline environment.

The purpose of this study was to over-express thermostable beta-d-mannanase from the thermophilic actinomycete Thermobifida fusca BCRC 19214 using a Pichia pastoris expression system. The maximum intracellular beta-d-mannanase activity obtained from the cell-free extract was approximately 40.0U/mL after 72h of cultivating a P. pastoris transformant (pPICZ-man) induced with methanol. Hydrolysis of native LBG galactomannan with 8U/mL beta-d-mannanase for 24h significantly decreased the weight-average molecular weight of LBG galactomannan from 5,580,010 to 3188. Native and hydrolyzed LBG galactomannan in a range of 0-0.2% did not trigger significant cytotoxicity after 24h of treatment compared with the control. The native LBG galactomannan stimulated RAW 264.7 cells to produce cytokine TNF-alpha dose-dependently, but there was no significant IL-1beta or nitric oxide production. The native LBG galactomannan also stimulated beta-hexosaminidase secretion in RBL-2H3 cells. After the native LBG galactomannan was hydrolyzed with beta-d-mannanase, all of the immunological properties disappeared.

The biological activity of these molecules is related to their size and acetylation degree. Chitinase Chit42 from Trichoderma harzianum hydrolyses chitin oligomers with a minimal of three N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units. Gene chit42 was previously characterized, and according to its sequence, the encoded protein included in the structural Glycoside Hydrolase family GH18.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Chit42 was expressed in Pichia pastoris using fed-batch fermentation to about 3 g/L. Protein heterologously expressed showed similar biochemical properties to those expressed by the natural producer (42 kDa, optima pH 5.5-6.5 and 30-40 degrees C). In addition to hydrolyse colloidal chitin, this enzyme released reducing sugars from commercial chitosan of different sizes and acetylation degrees. Chit42 hydrolysed colloidal chitin at least 10-times more efficiently (defined by the kcat/Km ratio) than any of the assayed chitosan. Production of partially acetylated chitooligosaccharides was confirmed in reaction mixtures using HPAEC-PAD chromatography and mass spectrometry. Masses corresponding to (D-glucosamine)1-8-GlcNAc were identified from the hydrolysis of different substrates. Crystals from Chit42 were grown and the 3D structure determined at 1.8 A resolution, showing the expected folding described for other GH18 chitinases, and a characteristic groove shaped substrate-binding site, able to accommodate at least six sugar units. Detailed structural analysis allows depicting the features of the Chit42 specificity, and explains the chemical nature of the partially acetylated molecules obtained from analysed substrates.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Chitinase Chit42 was expressed in a heterologous system to levels never before achieved. The enzyme produced small partially acetylated chitooligosaccharides, which have enormous biotechnological potential in medicine and food. Chit42 3D structure was characterized and analysed. Production and understanding of how the enzymes generating bioactive chito-oligomers work is essential for their biotechnological application, and paves the way for future work to take advantage of chitinolytic activities.</p></details></div>

Xyn10A has a specific xylanase activity of 34.4 U mg(-1), and is optimally active at 90 degrees C and pH 6.0. Xyn10A shows quite stable at pHs ranging from 3.0 to 11.0, and keeps over 40% of xylanase activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 1 h. Removal of CBM1 domain has a slight negative effect on its thermostability, but the further cleavage of linker region significantly decreased its stability at high temperature. The transfer of CBM1 and linker region to another GH10 xylanase can help to increase the thermostability. In addition, hydrolase domains between the two Xyn10A proteins naturally formed a dimer structure, which became more thermostable after removing the CBM1 or/and linker region.

We found that co-production of the chaperones CNE1p and Kar2p, the foldase PDI1p, the UPR-activator Hac1p as well as the FAD synthetase FAD1p enhanced THCAS activity levels within the K. phaffii cells. The strongest influence showed co-expression of Hac1s - increasing the volumetric THCAS activities 4.1-fold on average. We also combined co-production of Hac1p with the other beneficial helper proteins to further enhance THCAS activity levels. An optimized strain overexpressing Hac1s, FAD1 and CNE1 was isolated that showed 20-fold increased volumetric, intracellular THCAS activity compared to the starting strain. We used this strain for a whole cell bioconversion of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) to THCA. After 8h of incubation at 37 degrees C, the cells produced 3.05gL(-1) THCA corresponding to 12.5% gTHCA gCDW(-1).</p></details></div>

The increasing need for highly purified and biologically active hCKMB in the field of diagnostics makes its production valuable. Currently, the production of hCKMB is mainly achieved in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, because the production in Escherichia coli is challenging and generally yields an inactive enzyme with a low quantity. With the aim of finding the best way for the high-yield production of active hCKMB in E. coli, an efficient strategy was developed using a construct allowing tandem expression of each subunit with 2 different tags. The strategy allowed the efficient expression and separate characterization of each subunit and 1-step purification of the heterodimeric protein into homogeneity. The heterodimeric protein displayed more than 11-fold greater specific activity than the commercially available one. The production strategy described in this study shows a clear advantage over the currently used ones and can be made available not only for laboratory scale production but also for commercial production. Our study is also a well-suited example for the studies in which novel protein expression strategies are needed to achieve greater yields with higher purities.</p></details></div>

Here, we report a rapid and cost-effective method to purify heterologous actins expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris Actin is expressed as a fusion with the actin-binding protein thymosin beta4 and purified by means of an affinity tag introduced in the fusion. Following cleavage of thymosin beta4 and the affinity tag, highly purified functional full-length actin is liberated. We purify actins from Saccharomycescerevisiae and Schizosaccharomycespombe, and the beta- and gamma-isoforms of human actin. We also report a modification of the method that facilitates expression and purification of arginylated actin, a form of actin thought to regulate dendritic actin networks in mammalian cells.

Komagataella spp.) is a popular cell factory for recombinant protein production. Yeasts in general provide a good starting point for cell factory engineering. They are intrinsically robust and easy to manipulate and cultivate. However, their secretory pathway is not evolutionarily adapted to high loads of secretory protein. In particular, more complex proteins, like the antibody fragment (Fab) used in this study, overwhelm the folding and secretion capacity. This triggers cellular stress responses, which may cause excessive intracellular degradation. Previous results have shown that, in fact, about 60 % of the newly synthesized Fab is intracellularly degraded. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is one possible intracellular degradation pathway for proteins aimed for secretion. We therefore targeted ERAD for cell factory engineering and investigated the impact on recombinant protein secretion in P. pastoris. Three components of the ERAD-L complex, which is involved in the degradation of luminal proteins, and a protein involved in proteasomal degradation, were successfully disrupted in Fab-secreting P. pastoris. Contrary to expectation, the effect on secretion was marginal. In the course of more detailed investigation of the impact of ERAD, we took a closer look at the intracellular variants of the recombinant protein. This enabled us to further zero in on the issue of intracellular Fab degradation and exclude an overshooting ER quality control. We propose that a major fraction of the Fab is actually degraded before entering the secretory pathway.</p></details></div>

Despite its highly selective mechanism of action, the presence of this flavooxidase in different biotechnological settings has hitherto been hampered by the lack of appropriate heterologous expression systems. We recently described the functional expression of the AAO from Pleurotus eryngii in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by fusing a chimeric signal peptide (prealphaproK) and applying structure-guided evolution. Here, we have obtained an AAO secretion variant that is readily expressed in S. cerevisiae and overproduced in Pichia pastoris. First, the functional expression of AAO in S. cerevisiae was enhanced through the in vivo shuffling of a panel of secretion variants, followed by the focused evolution of the prealphaproK peptide. The outcome of this evolutionary campaign-an expression variant that accumulated 4 mutations in the chimeric signal peptide, plus two mutations in the mature protein- showed 350-fold improved secretion (4.5 mg/L) and was stable. This secretion mutant was cloned into P. pastoris and fermented in a fed-batch bioreactor to enhance production to 25 mg/L. While both recombinant AAO from S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris were subjected to the same N-terminal processing and had a similar pH activity profile, they differed in their kinetic parameters and thermostability. The strong glycosylation observed in the evolved AAO from S. cerevisiae underpinned this effect, since when the mutant was produced in the glycosylation-deficient S. cerevisiae strain Deltakre2, its kinetic parameters and thermostability were comparable to its poorly glycosylated P. pastoris recombinant counterpart.</p></details></div>

Previously it was expressed in Escherichia coli; however, the E. coli-derived recombinant VpDef did not show effective antimicrobial activity against Staphyloccocus aureus or the Gram-negative bacteria tested. As such, the goal of this study was to design, express, and purify a recombinant VpDef (rVpDef) in Pichia pastoris and to determine its antibacterial potency and stability. A 6.9KDa rVpDef was successfully expressed as a secreted peptide in P. pastoris, and the amount of rVpDef accumulation was shown to reach as high as approximate 60mug per 1ml of culture medium only after an initial optimization was performed. The purified rVpDef demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was active against six typical common bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. A minimal inhibition concentration of as low as 50mug/ml was observed for rVpDef against the growth of E. coli O157 (ATCC 35150). Moreover, rVpDef was tolerant to temperature shock and proteinase digestion and maintained a high stability over a relatively broad pH range. In addition, rVpDef had a low hemolytic activity against rabbit erythrocytes. Taken together, this study demonstrated that rVpDef could be produced in a large-scale manner in P. pastoris and has a good antibacterial activity and suitable stability. This is the first report on heterologous expression of a biologically active VpDef in P. pastoris, supporting its use for both research and application purposes.</p></details></div>

However, the broad application of this protein is seriously limited by its short supply. In this work, the codon sequence of HSA was cloned under the control of the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (AOX1) and expressed as a secretory protein in Pichia pastoris. A recombinant strain displaying the highest HSA yield was selected by screening for resistance to the highest concentration of antibiotic G418. After optimizing the induction conditions and additional supplements, the highest yield of HSA reached 1.6 g/L in a shake flask. Performing high density fermentation further improved the highest yield to 8.86 g/L in a fermenter after 96 h of methanol induction. This result is more promising than the previous reports of industrial applications, which reported the highest yield as 92.29 mg/L/h, considering that the space-time yield of rHSA was doubled. In addition, the desired protein was purified by filtration and Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, which yielded a 58% recovery of a product that had over a 96% purity. This study reveals that Pichia pastoris is an excellent system for recombinant human serum albumin expression due to its outstanding expression capacity. In addition, the high efficiency level of rHSA production lays a solid foundation for its use in industrial production.</p></details></div>

Recently, a protein harboring DM9 repeats was identified as mannose-specific lectin (CgCGL1, renamed as CgDM9CP-1) from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. In the present study, another DM9 containing protein was identified from oyster C. gigas (designated as CgDM9CP-2). The open reading frame of CgDM9CP-2 gene was of 432 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids with two tandem DM9 repeats. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgDM9CP-2 shared 60.8% identity with that of CgDM9CP-1. In the unrooted phylogenetic tree, CgDM9CP-2 was closely clustered with CgDM9CP-1, and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate DM9CPs. The mRNA transcripts of CgDM9CP-2 were expressed in all the tested tissues, including mantle, gonad, gills, adductor muscle, hemocytes, and hepatopancreas, with the highest expression level in gills. CgDM9CP-2 protein was mainly distributed on the cytomembrane of oyster hemocytes. After mannose stimulation, the mRNA expression of CgDM9CP-2 in gills was up-regulated to the peak level (5.90-fold of that in SSW group, p<0.05) at 24h, and kept at a significantly higher level compared with that in control group at 6-48h. It significantly increased at 6h (2.33-fold, p<0.05), and 12h (3.08-fold, p<0.05) post Vibrio splendidus stimulation, and then gradually decreased from 48 to 72h (p<0.05) with significant difference comparing with that in control group. The recombinant CgDM9CP-2 protein (rCgDM9CP-2) displayed higher binding affinity to D-(+)-mannose while lower binding affinity to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. rCgDM9CP-2 also exhibited binding activity towards fungi (Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus), and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas hydrophila and V. splendidus). It could agglutinate fungi P. pastoris and Y. lipolytica, and inhibit the growth of P. pastoris, S. aureus, V. anguillarum, and V. splendidus. These results collectively indicated that CgDM9CP-2 not only served as a pattern recognition receptor with a broad range of recognition spectrum, but also involved in inhibiting the growth of invading microbe in the innate immune response of oyster, which would provide further evidence for the function of DM9 domain in the innate immune system.</p></details></div>

Western blot and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were used to examine the reactivity of rFg14-3-3e protein to anti-F. gigantica and anti-rFg14-3-3e antibodies, respectively. Various assays were used to investigate the stimulatory effects of the purified rFg14-3-3e protein on specific functions of goat PBMCs, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, migration, nitric oxide (NO) production, phagocytosis, and apoptotic capabilities. Potential protein interactors of rFg14-3-3e were identified by querying the databases Intact, String, BioPlex and BioGrid. A Total Energy analysis of each of the identified interaction was performed. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using Funcassociate 3.0.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Sequence analysis revealed that rFg14-3-3e protein had 100% identity to 14-3-3 protein from Fasciola hepatica.

Also, this recombinant protein promoted the release of NO and cell apoptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of goat PBMCs and suppressed monocyte phagocytosis. Homology modelling revealed 65% identity between rFg14-3-3e and human 14-3-3 protein YWHAE.

The expression level at the optimal condition (initial pH 7.0, 1.0% final methanol concentration and induction for 72 h at 26 degrees C) was 0.24 mg/mL cell-free broth. Lunasin analog, obtained from purified lunasin-4 protein through enterokinase digestion and ultrafiltration, significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, intracellular signaling array analysis demonstrated down-regulated levels of phosphorylated Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k) and an up-regulated level of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) after lunasin analog treatment.

We identified a hypothetical protein (annotated as AO090012000917) encoded in the Aspergillus oryzae genome that exhibits sequence similarity with Aspergillus niger rutinosidase. The recombinant enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and purified as a glyco-protein with apparent molecular mass of 65-75 kDa by SDS-PAGE.

Optimal enzymatic activity was observed at pH 4.0 and temperature of 45 degrees C. This enzyme is also significantly thermo-stable, with 90% activity retained after 1 h at 45 degrees C and 70% activity retained after 4 h, even at 50 degrees C. Biochemical characterization revealed that the enzyme has higher substrate specificity for 3-O-linked flavonoid beta-rutinosides like rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, than for 7-O-linked flavonoid beta-rutinoside like hesperidin. However, no activity was found with naringin, diosmin, monoglycosylated chromogenic substrates, and polymeric laminarin substrate. Kinetic analyses showed that K m value toward rutin was higher than those toward hesperidin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside.

The black liquor (BL) generated exhibits a high chemical oxygen demand (COD), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and chlorophenol content, along with an augmented colour and increased pH. BL is often discharged into water bodies, where it has a negative impact on the environment. Towards that end, laccases are of great interest for bioremediation, since they can degrade aromatic and non-aromatic compounds while reducing O2 to water instead of H2O2. As such, we evaluated Pleurotus ostreatus and Pichia pastoris (which produces rPOXA 1B laccase) in the treatment of synthetic BL (SBL) in an "in vitro" modified Kraft process followed by CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis. Treating SBL with P. ostreatus viable biomass (VB) followed by CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis resulted in 80.3% COD removal and 70.6% decolourisation. Toxic compounds such as 2-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol, and 2-methoxyphenol were eliminated. Post-treated SBL exhibited low phytotoxicity, as evidenced by a Lactuca sativa L seed germination index (GI) > 50%. Likewise, SBL treatment with P. pastoris followed by VB/CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis resulted in 63.7% COD removal and 46% decolourisation. Moreover, this treatment resulted in the elimination of most unwanted compounds, with the exception of 4-chlorophenol. The Lactuca sativa L seed GI of the post-treated SBL was 40%, indicating moderate phytotoxicity.</p></details></div>

Based on traditional culture-dependent methods, these functional enzymes are hardly obtained. According to our previous metatranscriptomic analysis, which identifies plenty of thermostable carbohydrate-active enzymes in NF liquor starter, the aim of this study is to provide a direct and efficient way to mine these thermostable enzymes.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In present study, an alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) gene, which showed the highest expression level of enzymes in starch degradation at high temperature stage (62 degrees C), was directly obtained by functional metatranscriptomics from Chinese Nong-flavor liquor starter and expressed in Pichia pastoris. NFAmy13A had a typical signal peptide and shared the highest sequence identity of 64% with alpha-amylase from Aspergillus niger. The recombinant enzyme of NFAmy13A showed an optimal pH at 5.0-5.5 and optimal temperature at 60 degrees C. NFAmy13A was activated and stabilized by Ca(2+), and its half-lives at 60 and 70 degrees C were improved significantly from 1.5 and 0.4 h to 16 and 0.7 h, respectively, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2. Meanwhile, Hg(2+), Co(2+) and SDS largely inhibited its activity. NFAmy13A showed the maximum activity on amylopectin, followed by various starches, amylose, glycogen, and pullulan, and its specificity activity on amylopectin was 200.4 U/mg. Moreover, this alpha-amylase efficiently hydrolyzed starches (from corn, wheat, and potato) at high concentrations up to 15 mg/ml.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study provides a direct way to mine active enzymes from man-made environment of NF liquor starter, by which a fungal thermostable alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) is successfully obtained. The good characteristics of NFAmy13A in degrading starch at high temperature are consistent with its pivotal role in solid-state fermentation of NF liquor brewing. This work would stimulate mining more enzymes from NF liquor starter and studying their potentially synergistic roles in NF liquor brewing, thus paving the way toward the optimization of liquor production and improvement of liquor quality in future.</p></details></div>

However, there is currently no commercial vaccine available to prevent CVA10 infection. Here we report the development of a recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) based candidate vaccine for CVA10. Co-expression of the capsid protein precursor P1 and the protease 3CD of CVA10 in Pichia pastoris resulted in cleavage of P1 into three capsid subunit proteins VP0, VP1, and VP3. These three subunit proteins co-assembled into CVA10 VLPs, which were visualized as spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 30nm under electron microscope. Immunization studies showed that CVA10 VLP could efficiently induce antigen-specific serum antibodies in mice. The anti-VLP sera were able to potently neutralize homologous and heterologous CVA10 strains. Importantly, passively transferred anti-VLP sera fully protected recipient neonatal mice from lethal CVA10 infection. In addition, neonatal mice born to the VLP-immunized dams were also completely protected from CVA10 lethal challenge. Collectively, these data show that CVA10 VLP represents a promising CVA10 vaccine candidate.</p></details></div>

To penetrate the cell wall and thereby to facilitate infection, microbial pathogens are equipped with a wide array of cell wall-degrading enzymes to depolymerize the polysaccharides in the cell wall. However, many of these enzymes and their role in the pathogenesis of microbial pathogens are not characterized, especially those from Oomycetes. In this study, we analyzed the function of four putative endo-beta-1,4-xylanase-encoding genes (ppxyn1-ppxyn4) from Phytophthora parasitica, an oomycete plant pathogen known to cause severe disease in a wide variety of plant species. All four genes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10). Recombinant proteins of ppxyn1, ppxyn2, and ppxyn4 obtained from the yeast Pichia pastoris showed degrading activities toward birch wood xylan, but they behaved differently in terms of the conditions for optimal activity, thermostability, and durability. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed upregulated expression of all four genes, especially ppxyn1 and ppxyn2, during plant infection. In contrast, ppxyn3 was highly expressed in cysts and its close homolog, ppxyn4, in germinating cysts. To uncover the role of ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the pathogenesis of P. parasitica, we generated silencing transformants for these two genes by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing. Silencing ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 reduced the virulence of P. parasitica toward tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and tomato plants. These results demonstrate the crucial role of xylanase-encoding ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the infection process of P. parasitica.</p></details></div>

One candidate organism for lactic acid production is Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for heterologous protein production. Nevertheless, this yeast has a poor fermentative capability that can be modulated by controlling oxygen levels. In a previous study, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was introduced into P. pastoris, enabling this yeast to produce lactic acid. The present study aimed to increase the flow of pyruvate towards the production of lactic acid in P. pastoris. To this end, a strain designated GLp was constructed by inserting the bovine lactic acid dehydrogenase gene (LDHb) concomitantly with the interruption of the gene encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). Aerobic fermentation, followed by micro-aerophilic culture two-phase fermentations, showed that the GLp strain achieved a lactic acid yield of 0.65 g/g. The distribution of fermentation products demonstrated that the acetate titer was reduced by 20% in the GLp strain with a concomitant increase in arabitol production: arabitol increased from 0.025 g/g to 0.174 g/g when compared to the GS115 strain. Taken together, the results show a significant potential for P. pastoris in producing lactic acid. Moreover, for the first time, physiological data regarding co-product formation have indicated the redox balance limitations of this yeast.</p></details></div>

Hyaluronidases from animal venoms cleave hyaluronan present in the extracellular matrix, acting as spreading factors of toxins into the tissues of the victim. However, the in-depth characterization of hyaluronidase from animal venoms has been neglected due to its instability and low concentration in the venom, which hamper its isolation. Thus, heterologous expression of hyaluronidase acts as a biotechnological tool in the obtainment of enough amounts of the enzyme for structural and functional studies. Therefore, this study produced a recombinant hyaluronidase from Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, designated as rTsHyal-1, in the Pichia pastoris system. Thus, a gene for TsHyal-1 (gb|KF623285.1) was synthesized and cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector (GenScript Corporation) for heterologous expression in P. pastoris. rTsHyal-1 was expressed in laboratorial scale in a buffered minimal medium containing methanol (BMM) for 96 h with daily addition of methanol. Expression of rTsHyal-1 resulted in a total protein yield of 0.266 mg/mL. rTsHyal-1 partially purified through cation exchange chromatography presented a specific activity of 1097 TRU/mg, against 838 TRU/mg for the final expressed material, representing a 1.31-fold purification. rTsHyal-1 has molecular mass of 49.5 kDa, and treatment with PNGase F and analysis by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) indicated a potential N-glycosylation of 4.5 kDa. Additionally, de novo sequencing of rTsHyal-1, performed in MALDI-TOF and Q Exactive Orbitrap MS, resulted in 46.8% of protein sequence coverage. rTsHyal-1 presents the highest substrate specificity to hyaluronan followed by chondroitin-6-sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate and showed an optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C. These results validate the biotechnological process for the heterologous expression of rTsHyal-1.

After an appropriate cloning strategy, this genetically engineered inulinase was successfully overproduced in fed-batch fermentations, reaching up to 840 U/ml after a 72-h cultivation. The protein, purified to homogeneity by chromatographic techniques, was obtained at a 42% yield.

An efficient method based on bio-brick was developed to construct a series of vectors harboring different copy numbers of ROL gene cassettes, which were then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 to generate a strain with specific copy numbers of ROL. An optimized gene-dosage recombinant strain of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# harboring five copies of ROL was screened, revealing production of the highest activity (2700 U/mL), which was 8-fold higher than that of the strain harboring one copy.

Optically pure 2,3-BD is a crucial precursor for the chiral synthesis and it can also be used as anti-freeze agent due to its low freezing point. 2,3-BD has been produced in both native and non-native hosts. Several pathogenic bacteria were reported to produce 2,3-BD in mixture of its optical isomers including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Engineered hosts based on episomal plasmid expression such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis are not ideal for industrial fermentation due to plasmid instability. Results: Pichia pastoris is generally regarded as safe and a well-established host for high-level heterologous protein production. To produce pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD enantiomer, we developed a P. pastoris strain by introducing a synthetic pathway. The alsS and alsD genes from B. subtilis were codon-optimized and synthesized. The BDH1 gene from S. cerevisiae was cloned. These three pathway genes were integrated into the genome of P. pastoris and expressed under the control of GAP promoter. Production of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was achieved using glucose as feedstock. The optical purity of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was more than 99%. The titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD reached 12 g/L with 40 g/L glucose as carbon source in shake flask fermentation. The fermentation conditions including pH, agitation speeds and aeration rates were optimized in batch cultivations. The highest titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD achieved in fed-batch fermentation using YPD media was 45 g/L. The titer of 2,3-BD was enhanced to 74.5 g/L through statistical medium optimization. Conclusions: The potential of engineering P. pastoris into a microbial cell factory for biofuel production was evaluated in this work using (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD as an example. Engineered P. pastoris could be a promising workhorse for the production of optically pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD.</p></details></div>

Spt23 is responsible for regulation of Delta-9 desaturase expression in Pichia pastoris. Disruption of SPT23 leads to a remarkable decrease in cellular unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, we found that deletion of SPT23 resulted in growth defects under high temperature culture conditions and heat treatment induced the expression of SPT23. By measuring expression changes of heat shock proteins, protein levels and cellular localization of Hsf1, it was revealed that the sensitivity of spt23Delta to high temperature was independent of the heat shock response. Addition of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol can restore the growth defects of spt23Delta under heat conditions. In addition, loss of SPT23 led to increased plasma membrane permeability, decreased plasma membrane integrity, depolarization, ergosterol synthesis defects and cell wall component disorder, which suggested that the sensitivity to heat treatment in spt23Delta was due to plasma membrane damage. Taken together, our results give new insights into the relationship between Spt23 and high temperature environmental stress.</p></details></div>

However, the low performance in extreme conditions seriously challenges the enzyme's commercial utilization. To obtain endoglucanases with substantially improved activity and thermostability, structure-based rational design was carried out based on the Chaetomium thermophilum beta-1,4-endoglucanase CTendo45. In this study, five mutant enzymes were constructed by substitution of conserved and noncatalytic residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants were constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and ultimately tested for enzymatic characteristics. Two single mutants, Y30F and Y173F, increased the enzyme's specific activity 1.35- and 1.87-fold using carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) as a substrate, respectively. Furthermore, CTendo45 and mutants exhibited higher activity towards beta-D-glucan than that of CMC-Na, and activities of Y173F and Y30F were also increased obviously against beta-D-glucan. In addition, Y173F significantly improved the enzyme's heat resistance at 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C. More interestingly, the double mutant Y30F/Y173F obtained considerably higher stability at elevated temperatures but failed to inherit the increased catalytic efficiency of its single mutant counterparts. This work gives an initial insight into the biological function of conserved and noncatalytic residues of thermostable endoglucanases and proposes a feasible path for the improvement of enzyme redesign proposals.</p></details></div>

They occur in every kingdom of life and catalyze essential reactions, such as carbon source assimilation, synthesis of hormones and secondary metabolites, or degradation of xenobiotics. Due to their outstanding ability of specifically hydroxylating complex hydrocarbons, there is a great demand to use these enzymes for biocatalysis, including applications at an industrial scale. Thus, the recombinant production of these enzymes is intensively investigated. However, especially eukaryotic P450s are difficult to produce. Challenges are faced due to complex cofactor requirements and the availability of a redox-partner (cytochrome P450 reductase, CPR) can be a key element to get active P450s. Additionally, most eukaryotic P450s are membrane bound which complicates the recombinant production. This review describes current strategies for expression of P450s in the microbial cell factories Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Pichia pastoris.</p></details></div>

The mRmMan5A showed maximum activity at pH 4.5 and 65 degrees C, and exhibited high specific activities towards mannans. To produce manno-oligosaccharides, palm kernel cake (PKC) was pretreated by steam explosion at 200 degrees C for 7.5min, and then hydrolyzed by mRmMan5A.

Therefore, initiating methanol induction at lower cell concentration is considered as an alternative strategy to overcome those problems. However, the methanol/energy regulation mechanisms of initiating induction at lower concentration are not clear and seldom reported. In this article, with monellin production as a prototype, we analyzed the methanol/energy metabolism in protein expression process using the strategies of initiating induction at both higher/lower cells concentrations. We attempted to interpret the advantages of the "alternative" strategy, via online measurements of methanol consumption, CO(2) production and O(2) uptake rates. When adopting this "alternative" strategy and maintaining temperature at 30 degrees C, carbon flux ratio directing into monellin precursors synthesis reached the highest level of 65%.

In spite of different attempts to produce recombinant human KGF in many organisms, including bacteria, mammalian cells, plant cells and insect cells; production of recombinant form suffers from lower yields and recovery relative to other recombinant proteins of similar size and properties. Due to many advantages of Pichia pastoris expression systems for producing industrial enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins, in this study P. pastoris was chosen as a host for KGF expression. For preparing human KGF coding sequence, MCF-7 cell line was treated with 1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 for inducing the expression of KGF. The coding sequence of 23N-terminal truncated KGF form was amplified using RT-PCR technique and then cloned into the yeast expression vector in frame with the yeast alpha-factor secretion signal. The recombinant plasmid was integrated into Pichia pastoris strain X-33 genome. Western blotting and Mass Spectrometry demonstrated that recombinant human KGF (rhKGF) was correctly expressed after methanol induction and secreted into the media. The recombinant protein was purified from the media by heparin affinity chromatography. MTT assay showed that the purified rhKGF had a proliferative effect on NIH3T3 and A549 cell lines. In addition, protective effect of recombinant KGF was assessed in A549 cell line after irradiation. The results showed that the recombinant protein was biologically active. Finally, the effect of recombinant KGF was investigated on proliferation of MCF-7 cell line and its response to radiation.

In nature, this conversion is associated with a defense mechanism of fungal pathogens against phytoalexins generated by host plants after infection. As of today, a gene sequence coding for kievitone hydratase activity has only been identified and characterized in Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli. Here, we report on the identification of a putative kievitone hydratase sequence in Nectria haematococca (NhKHS), the teleomorph state of F. solani, based on in silico sequence analyses. After heterologous expression of the enzyme in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, we have confirmed its kievitone hydration activity and have assessed its biochemical properties and substrate specificity. Purified recombinant NhKHS is obviously a homodimeric glycoprotein. Due to its good activity for the readily available chalcone derivative xanthohumol (XN), this compound was selected as a model substrate for biochemical studies. The optimal pH and temperature for hydratase activity were 6.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively, and apparent Vmax and Km values for hydration of XN were 7.16 mumol min-1 mg-1 and 0.98 +/- 0.13 mM, respectively. Due to its catalytic properties and apparent substrate promiscuity, NhKHS is a promising enzyme for the biocatalytic production of tertiary alcohols.</p></details></div>

Due to lack of glycosylation, rhIL-11 is suitable to be expressed by yeast cells. However, the only available yeast-derived rhIL-11 presents an obstacle in low production yield, as well as an unamiable process, such as the use of reverse-phase chromatography employing plenty of toxic organic solvents. Our findings showed that the low yield was due to self-aggregation of rhIL-11. A novel process recovering bioactive rhIL-11 from the yeast secretory medium therefore has been developed and demonstrated, involving fermentation from Pichia pastoris, followed by a two-phase extraction to precipitate rhIL-11. After renaturing, the protein of interest was purified by a two-column step, comprising a cation-exchanger, and a hydrophobic interaction chromatography in tandem at high sample loads that was facile and cost-effective in future scale-up. Identity and quality assessments confirmed the expected amino acid sequence without N-terminal heterogeneity, as well as high quality in potency and purity. Such a process provides an alternative and adequate supply of the starting material for the PEGylated rhIL-11.</p></details></div>

In this study, the immune vaccinal response of the recombinant protein rNcSRS2 of N. caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris and formulated with water-in-oil emulsion, xanthan gum, and alum hydroxide was assessed in an experimental murine model. Groups of 10 Balb/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated with two doses of prNcSRS2 twenty-one days apart.

All groups elicited specific antibodies against prNcSRS2, with the water-in-oil group showing significantly (p</=.05) elevated titers compared to the other groups. The prNcSRS2 protein alone did not induce a significant ex vivo splenic transcription level of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 cytokines, except for IL-17A, and the adjuvant associations with the prNcSRS2 protein induced different cytokine transcription profiles.

We used RACE PCR to isolate novel enzymes from Galium verum with the ability to clot milk. This approach generated two cDNA sequences (named preprogaline A and B) encoding proteins displaying the typical plant aspartic protease primary structure. Preprogaline B was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, after deleting and replacing its original signal peptide with the yeast alpha-factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The secreted recombinant protein was obtained by growing P. pastoris in YPD medium and had the ability to clot milk. The mature form of progaline B is a heterodimeric glycosylated enzyme, with a molecular weight of approximately 48kDa, that contains a heavy (30.7kDa) and a light (13.5kDa) polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. Western blot analysis revealed that progaline B is activated by the acidification of the yeast culture medium and that enzymatic activation requires two steps. First the precursor protein is cleaved into two polypeptide chains by partial removal of the plant-specific insert (PSI) present in plant aspartic proteases; this is later followed by propeptide removal. By altering the pH of the P. pastoris culture medium, we were able to obtain either active or inactive forms of the enzyme. Recombinant progaline B displayed a kappa-casein hydrolysis pattern analogous to those produced by the animal and microbial coagulants currently used in the dairy industry, but it exhibited a different digestion profile on alpha- and beta-caseins. The plant protease progaline B displays milk-clotting activities suitable for the production of novel dairy products.</p></details></div>

After being challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, the expression of EcNAG was up-regulated significantly at 6h and reached the peak at 12h. And then, the expression began to down-regulated and came to the normal level at 72h. It is helpful to research the relationship between the molt-related hormones and chitinlytic enzymes.</p></details></div>

Komagataella phaffii) is one of the most common eukaryotic expression systems for heterologous protein production. Expression cassettes are typically integrated in the genome to obtain stable expression strains. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where short overhangs are sufficient to target highly specific integration, long overhangs are more efficient in P. pastoris and ectopic integration of foreign DNA can occur. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of ectopic integration by high-throughput screening of >700 transformants and whole-genome sequencing of 27 transformants. Different vector designs and linearization approaches were used to mimic the most common integration events targeted in P. pastoris Fluorescence of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter protein was highly uniform among transformants when the expression cassettes were correctly integrated in the targeted locus. Surprisingly, most nonspecifically integrated transformants showed highly uniform expression that was comparable to specific integration, suggesting that nonspecific integration does not necessarily influence expression. However, a few clones (<10%) harboring ectopically integrated cassettes showed a greater variation spanning a 25-fold range, surpassing specifically integrated reference strains up to 6-fold. High-expression strains showed a correlation between increased gene copy numbers and high reporter protein fluorescence levels. Our results suggest that for comparing expression levels between strains, the integration locus can be neglected as long as a sufficient numbers of transformed strains are compared. For expression optimization of highly expressible proteins, increasing copy number appears to be the dominant positive influence rather than the integration locus, genomic rearrangements, deletions, or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).IMPORTANCE Yeasts are commonly used as biotechnological production hosts for proteins and metabolites. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression cassettes carrying foreign genes integrate highly specifically at the targeted sites in the genome. In contrast, cassettes often integrate at random genomic positions in nonconventional yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). Hence, cells from the same transformation event often behave differently, with significant clonal variation necessitating the screening of large numbers of strains. The importance of this study is that we systematically investigated the influence of integration events in more than 700 strains. Our findings provide novel insight into clonal variation in P. pastoris and, thus, how to avoid pitfalls and obtain reliable results. The underlying mechanisms may also play a role in other yeasts and hence could be generally relevant for recombinant yeast protein production strains.</p></details></div>

This revelation has stimulated research aimed at developing sustainable and green cutinase-catalyzed PET recycling methods. Leaf and branch compost cutinase (LCC) is particularly suited toward these ends given its relatively high PET hydrolysis activity and thermostability. Any practical enzymatic PET recycling application will require that the protein have kinetic stability at or above the PET glass transition temperature (Tg, i.e., 70 degrees C). This paper elucidates the thermodynamics and kinetics of LCC conformational and colloidal stability. Aggregation emerged as a major contributor that reduces LCC kinetic stability. In its native state, LCC is prone to aggregation owing to electrostatic interactions. Further, with increasing temperature, perturbation of LCC's tertiary structure and corresponding exposure of hydrophobic domains leads to rapid aggregation. Glycosylation was employed in an attempt to impede LCC aggregation. Owing to the presence of three putative N-glycosylation sites, expression of native LCC in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production of glycosylated LCC (LCC-G). LCC-G showed improved stability to native state aggregation while increasing the temperature for thermal induced aggregation by 10 degrees C. Furthermore, stabilization against thermal aggregation resulted in improved catalytic PET hydrolysis both at its optimum temperature and concentration.</p></details></div>

The knowledge of insect gut immunity has been obtained mostly from Drosophila melanogaster. Little is known about gut immunity in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a pest destroying cruciferous crops worldwide. In this study, expressions of the immune-related genes in the midgut of P. xylostella orally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris were profiled by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR approaches. The results revealed that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways and possibly the prophenoloxidase activation system in P. xylostella could be activated by oral infections, and moricins, gloverins and lysozyme2 might act as important effectors against microorganisms. Subsequent knock-down of IMD showed that this gene was involved in regulating the expression of down-stream genes in the IMD pathway. Our work indicates that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways may synergistically modulate immune responses in the P. xylostella midgut, implying a complex and diverse immune system in the midgut of insects.</p></details></div>

In the present study, the full-length cDNA of a clip domain serine proteinase (designed as EsCDSP) gene was cloned from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. It was of 1488 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1134 bp encoding a polypeptide of 377 amino acids. There were a signal peptide, a clip domain, and a Tryp_SPc domain in the deduced amino acid sequence of EsCDSP. Highly conserved cysteine residues were identified in the clip domain and Tryp_SPc domain. EsCDSP shared similarities of 40%-61% with CDSPs from Penaeus monodon (ACP19562.1), Scylla paramamosain (CCW43200.1), Drosophila melanogaster (NP_649734.2) and Delia antiqua (AAW57295.1). It was clustered with other CDSPs from crabs in the phylogenetic tree. EsCDSP transcript was highly expressed in hemocytes and it could response to the stimulations of Vibro anguillarum and Pichia pastoris. rEsCDSP could activate proPO system and significantly increase the PO activity of HLS. In addition, rEsCDSP could bond to Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibro anguillarum and Vibro alginolyticus, and reduced the mortality rate causing by pathogen infection.

Acquiring control over the natural regulation of promoters is important for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications. In the commonly used protein production host Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris), methanol-inducible promoters are used because of their tight regulation and exceptional strength. Yet, induction with toxic and flammable methanol can be a considerable safety risk and cannot be applied in many existing fermentation plants. Here we studied new regulatory circuits based on the most frequently used alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1 ), which is tightly repressed in presence of repressing carbon sources and strongly induced by methanol. We compared different overexpression strategies for putative carbon source dependent regulators identified by a homology search in related yeasts and previously published literature in order to convert existing methanol dependent expression strains into methanol free systems. While constitutive overexpression showed only marginal or detrimental effects, derepressed expression (activated when the repressing carbon source is depleted) showed that three transcription factors (TFs) are single handedly suitable to strongly activate PAOX1 in P. pastoris without relying on any specifically engineered host strains. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that Mxr1, Mit1, and Prm1 regulate partly overlapping and unique sets of genes. Derepressed overexpression of a single TF was sufficient to retrofit existing PAOX1 based expression strains into glucose/glycerol regulated, methanol-free systems. Given the wide applicability of carbon source regulated promoters, the simplicity and low cost of controlling carbon source feed rates in large scale bioreactors, similar approaches as in P. pastoris may also be useful in other organisms.</p></details></div>

This lipase has a high identity with a putative triacylglycerol lipase of Leishmania major (Lmlip2). In the present study, Lmlip2 was expressed in the eukaryotic heterologous expression system Pichia pastoris as tagged enzyme of 308 amino acids. Maximal protein production was reached after 2 days of fermentation. Optimal Lmlip2 lipase activity was measured using the pH stat technique at pH 8at 26 degrees C using vinyl esters and triacylglycerols (true lipids) as substrates. Moreover, biochemical characterization of Lmlip2 contained in culture supernatant, illustrates that L. major secreted lipase is active and stable at low temperatures especially 26 degrees and prefer neutral pH; concerning substrate specificityLmlip2 presents a preference for short chains lipid substrates vinyl esters such as VC2, VC3 and VC4 likewise, it is capable to hydrolyze long chain triacylglycerols like olive oil. Metal ions and surfactants tested in this study decrease Lmlip2 activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the relation between the lipase activity and the virulence.

Km values for ABTS, SGZ and 2,6-DMP were 142.85muM, 10muM and 54.55muM and the corresponding kcat values were 60.6s(-1), 25.36s(-1) and 27.84s(-1), respectively. The t1/2 values of the rSLAC at 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C were 60h, 32h and 10h, respectively. The enzyme deactivation energy (Ed) was 117.275kJ/mol while DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS for thermal inactivation of the rSLAC were all positive. The rSLAC decolourised more than 90% of Brilliant Blue G and Trypan Blue dye in 6h without the addition of a mediator. High titres of SLAC expressed in P. pastoris enhance its potential for various industrial applications.</p></details></div>

Here, we explore the recombinant expression of globins in three different expression systems: Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and the baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda. We expressed two different human globin types in these three expression systems: I) the well-characterized neuroglobin and II) the uncharacterized, circular permutated globin domain of the large chimeric globin androglobin. It is clear from the literature that E.coli is the most used expression system for expression and purification of recombinant globins. However, the major disadvantage of E. coli is the formation of insoluble aggregates. We experienced that, for more complex multi-domain globins, like the chimeric globin androglobin, it is recommended to switch to a higher eukaryotic expression system.</p></details></div>

FAEs as auxiliary enzymes significantly assist xylanolytic and pectinolytic enzymes in gaining access to their site of action during biomass saccharification for biofuel and biochemical production. A limited number of FAEs have been functionally characterized compared to over 1000 putative fungal FAEs that were recently predicted by similarity-based genome mining, which divided phylogenetically into different subfamilies (SFs). In this study, 27 putative and six characterized FAEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were selected and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant proteins biochemically characterized to validate the previous genome mining and phylogenetical grouping and to expand the information on activity of fungal FAEs. As a result, 20 enzymes were shown to possess FAE activity, being active towards pNP-ferulate and/or methyl hydroxycinnamate substrates, and covering 11 subfamilies. Most of the new FAEs showed activities comparable to those of previously characterized fungal FAEs.</p></details></div>

Fructan can also be hydrolyzed by plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), but these enzymes have not been used to produce fructose commercially. Two Ht1-FEHs (Ht1-FEH I and Ht1-FEH II) were recently characterized in Jerusalem artichoke. In this study, we cloned the third member of the Ht1-FEH family in Jerusalem artichoke (i.e., Ht1-FEH III). When heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33, Ht1-FEH III not only demonstrated hydrolysis activity towards beta (2, 1)-linked fructans and beta (2, 6)-linked levan, but also towards sucrose. To explore the potential industrial applications, we heterologously expressed and purified six plant 1-FEHs from two typical fructan plants (i.e., chicory and Jerusalem artichoke) and showed that chicory Ci1-FEH IIa had the highest hydrolysis capacity to fructan in vitro. Furthermore, we immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa on resin and optimized the immobilization conditions. We found that inulin-type fructan or the tuber extract from Jerusalem artichoke could be rapidly degraded into fructose and sucrose by immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa. The capacity of Ci1-FEH IIa to release fructose from fructans was comparable to that of some inulinases from microorganisms.

The ChPLA2-V cDNA was synthesized from chicken heart polyA mRNA by RT-PCR, and an expression construct containing the PLA2 was established. After expression in Pichia pastoris cells, the active enzyme was purified. The purified ChPLA2-V protein was biochemically and physiologically characterized. The recombinant ChPLA2-V has an absolute requirement for Ca(2+) for enzymatic activity. The optimum pH for this enzyme is pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer with phosphatidylcholine as substrate. ChPLA2-V was found to display potent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bactericidal activity and antifungal activity in vitro. The purified enzyme ChPLA2-V with much stronger anticoagulant activity compared with the intestinal and pancreatic chicken PLA2-V was approximately 10 times more active.

Here a systematic replacement studies of the core promoter and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the exceptionally strong and tightly methanol regulated Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter at unprecedented resolution is performed. Adjacent triplets of the 200 bp long core promoter are mutated at a time by changing the wild-type sequence into cytosine or adenine triplets, resulting in 130 variants that are cloned upstream of an eGFP reporter gene providing a library for expression fine-tuning. Mutations in the TATA box motif, regions downstream of the transcription start site or next to the start codon in the 5'UTR had a significant effect on the eGFP fluorescence. Surprisingly, mutations in most other regions are tolerated, indicating that yeast core promoters can show a high tolerance toward small mutations, supporting regulatory models of degenerate motifs, or redundant design. The authors exploited these neutral core promoter positions, not affecting expression, to introduce extrinsic sequence elements such as cloning sites (allowing targeted core promoter/5'UTR modifications) and bacterial promoters (applicable in multi host vectors).</p></details></div>

In fact, this is an unusual reaction given the unfavorable conditions for dehydration. This characteristic strongly contributes to the potential of SBLE to become a 'green' tool in industrial applications. Indeed, lactonization occurs normally in organic solvents, an application for which microbial lipases are increasingly used as biocatalysts. Previously, we described the production of recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). However, expression was not optimal to delve deeper into the enzyme's potential for industrial application. In the current study, we explored codon-optimization of the SBLE gene and we optimized the rSBLE expression protocol. Temperature reduction had the biggest impact followed by codon-optimization and co-expression of the HAC1 transcription factor. Combining these approaches, we achieved a 32-fold improvement of the yield during rSBLE production (from 0.75 mg/l to 24 mg/L culture) accompanied with a strong reduction of contaminants after affinity purification.</p></details></div>

Pichia pastoris) is one of the most commonly used host systems for recombinant protein expression. Achieving targeted genetic modifications had been hindered by low frequencies of homologous recombination (HR). Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has been implemented for P. pastoris enabling gene knockouts based on indels (insertion, deletions) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at near 100% efficiency. However, specifically integrating homologous donor cassettes via HR for replacement studies had proven difficult resulting at most in approximately 20% correct integration using CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we demonstrate the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated integration of markerless donor cassettes at efficiencies approaching 100% using a ku70 deletion strain. The Ku70p is involved in NHEJ repair and lack of the protein appears to favor repair via HR near exclusively. While the absolute number of transformants in the Deltaku70 strain is reduced, virtually all surviving transformants showed correct integration. In the wildtype strain, markerless donor cassette integration was also improved up to 25-fold by placing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) on the donor cassette. Alternative strategies for improving donor cassette integration using a Cas9 nickase variant or reducing off targeting associated toxicity using a high fidelity Cas9 variant were so far not successful in our hands in P. pastoris. Furthermore we provide Cas9/gRNA expression plasmids with a Geneticin resistance marker which proved to be versatile tools for marker recycling. The reported CRSIPR-Cas9 tools can be applied for modifying existing production strains and also pave the way for markerless whole genome modification studies in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

In this study, the Escherichia coli chaperones (GroES-GroEL) were expressed from the PGAP promoter and targeted to the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ability of the ER targeted chaperones to improve production of bacterial protein in P. pastoris was evaluated. The chaperones tagged with alpha-factor secretion- and ER retention-signal sequences were co-expressed with either extracellularly secreted phytase or intracellular d-phenylglycine aminotransferase (D-PhgAT) enzymes. The ER residing GroEL-GroES successfully increased the levels of active phytase extracellularly, 1.5-2.3-fold higher than the phytase expression alone, but did not enhance the formation of active, intracellular D-PhgAT. These results indicate that the chaperones have the potential to enhance production of active enzymes when present in the same trafficking pathway. This is the first report on the improvement of extracellular bacterial protein production through co-expression with ER residing bacterial chaperones in the Pichia system.

Quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed LEG-1 to be almost exclusively transcribed and expressed in parasitic lungworm stages. Immunohistochemistry localized the enzyme in the parasite's gut, which was confirmed by immunoblots detecting LEG-1 in the gut as well as male testes. LEG-1 was recombinantly (rLEG-1) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and subsequently analysed in activity assays for its enzyme functions and substrate specificity. For sufficient functionality, rLEG-1 needed trans-activation through D. viviparus cathepsin L-2, indicating a novel mechanism of legumain activation. After trans-activation, rLEG-1 worked best at pH 5.5 and 35-39 degrees C and cleaved a legumain-specific artificial substrate as well as the natural substrates bovine collagen types I and II. In a clinical vaccination trial, rLEG-1 did not protect against challenge infection. Results of in vitro characterization, transcription pattern and localization enhance the presumption that LEG-1 participates in digestion processes of D. viviparus. Since rLEG-1 needs trans-activation through a cathepsin, it is probably involved in an enzyme cascade and therefore remains interesting as a candidate in a multi-component vaccine.</p></details></div>

In the present work, molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between rGlLCC1 or rPOXA 1B enzymes with Crystal Violet (CV) or Malachite Green (MG) dyes. In addition, removal tests of the two dyes were performed. Van der Waals interactions were obtained for only the CV dye for both GlLCC1 and POXA 1B enzymes. Nevertheless, in the GlLCC1 model, two pi-pi interactions were observed. For the MG dye only, Van der Waals interactions were obtained. Moreover, amino acid composition interacting in each model with each dye was similar. It is important to highlight that by molecular docking, none of the estimated ligand configurations generated hydrogen bonds. Thus, explaining the difficulty to degrade CV and MG. Regarding CV, maximum decolorization percentage was 23.6 +/- 1.0% using Ganoderma lucidum supernatant and 5.0 +/- 0.5% with Pleurotus ostreatus supernatant. When using recombinant laccase enzyme concentrates, decolorization percentages were 9.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.5 +/- 1.0% for rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B, respectively.

Because of its extensive application in medicine, recombinant DNA technology has been considered for its production. The current study examines coexpression of A1AT and soluble domain of v-SNARE in Pichia pastoris, which can prevent the secretion of A1AT after thoroughly passing the secretory pathway. This was done mainly to preserve the biological activity of A1AT, which in the secretory mode might be impaired in the fermentation and early clarification conditions. SNARE proteins are the driving force for vesicle docking and membrane fusion in the exocytosis. Intracellular expression of the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE and its subsequent interaction to form SNARE complex can intensify the competition for A1AT secretory vesicles to be fused and released to the media. Our investigation shows successful coexpression of A1AT in the form of post-Golgi vesicles and the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE. Our findings confirmed the reduction of A1AT secretion by 45% caused accumulation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles filled with A1AT inside the yeast cell. A1AT trapped in secretory vesicles were biologically more active than secretory A1AT. These results indicate that the inhibition of A1AT secretion can protect its biological activity in fermentation and clarification processes.</p></details></div>
