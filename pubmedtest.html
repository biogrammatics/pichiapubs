In the present study, a cysteine-rich motif associated immunoglobulin domain containing protein (designated CgCAICP-1) was identified in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The deduced protein sequence of CgCAICP-1 contained 534 amino acid residues, with three Ig domains which were designated as IG1, IG2 and IG3, and a cysteine-rich motif between the first and second Ig domain. The mRNA transcripts of CgCAICP-1 were highly expressed in hemocytes and up-regulated significantly (p<0.05) after the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), but not peptidoglycan (PGN). The recombinant CgCAICP-1 protein (rCgCAICP-1) exhibited binding activity to various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including LPS, PGN, mannose (Man) and d-galactose (D-Gal), and microorganisms including Vibrio splendidus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The phagocytic rates of oyster hemocytes towards Gram-negative bacteria V. splendidus and Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus were significantly enhanced (p<0.05) after pre-incubation of microbes with rCgCAICP-1. Furthermore, the transcripts of CgCAICP-1 exhibited high level of polymorphism among individuals. The ratio of synonymous and nonsynonymous distances (dN/dS) for AA'BCC'D strands of IG1 (the possible binding sites 1, pbs1) across all allelic variants was 2.09 (p<0.05), while the ratio for the non-pbs regions was less than 1.0. The 1248 bp fragment amplified from the 5' end of CgCAICP-1 open reading frame (ORF) from 24 transcript variants could be divided artificially into seven regions of 50 elements, and all of the allelic variants might be derived from these elements by point mutation and recombination processes. These results collectively suggested that CgCAICP-1 might function as an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to recognize various PAMPs and facilitated the phagocytosis of oyster hemocytes towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. CgCAICP-1 could generate diverse isoforms through point mutation and recombination process and maintained by balancing selection, which would provide a broader spectrum of interaction surface and be associated with immune resistance of oysters to infectious pathogens.</p></details></div>

The alpha-subunit of Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) is the main structural element of this channel. Tetramerization of KCNQ1 in the membrane results in formation of an ion channel, which comprises a pore and four voltage-sensing domains. Mutations in the human KCNQ1 gene are one of the major causes of inherited arrhythmias, long QT syndrome in particular. The construct encoding full-length human KCNQ1 protein was synthesized in this work, and an expression system in the Pichia pastoris yeast cells was developed. The membrane fraction of the yeast cells containing the recombinant protein (rKCNQ1) was solubilized with CHAPS detergent. To better mimic the lipid environment of the channel, lipid-protein nanodiscs were formed using solubilized membrane fraction and MSP2N2 protein. The rKCNQ1/nanodisc and rKCNQ1/CHAPS samples were purified using the Rho1D4 tag introduced at the C-terminus of the protein. Protein samples were examined using transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. In both cases, homogeneous rKCNQ1 samples were observed based on image analysis. Statistical analysis of the images of individual protein particles solubilized in the detergent revealed the presence of a tetrameric structure confirming intact subunit assembly. A three-dimensional channel structure reconstructed at 2.5-nm resolution represents a compact density with diameter of the membrane part of ~9 nm and height ~11 nm. Analysis of the images of rKCNQ1 in nanodiscs revealed additional electron density corresponding to the lipid bilayer fragment and the MSP2N2 protein. These results indicate that the nanodiscs facilitate protein isolation, purification, and stabilization in solution and can be used for further structural studies of human Kv7.1.</p></details></div>

Gcw13, one of these GPI-anchored proteins, was found to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of the histidine auxotrophic P. pastoris strain GS115 on methanol as the sole carbon source. To investigate the biological function of Gcw13, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to compare the difference of gene expression between GS115 and GCW13-deletion strain D13. RNA-Seq analysis showed that, in strain D13, the expression of genes involved in the methanol utilization pathway or peroxisome biogenesis was not changed, and a high proportion of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids were down-regulated, whereas GAP1, which encodes a general amino acid permease, was significantly up-regulated. Besides, the intracellular concentrations of various amino acids were significantly higher in D13 than that in GS115. We also observed that deletion of GCW13 resulted in more Gap1 presented on the cell surface and more active uptake of the toxic proline analogue l-azetidine-2-carboxylate acid (AzC). These results suggest that Gcw13 suppresses the expression of GAP1 and facilitates the endocytosis of Gap1 on methanol, resulting in decreasing Gap1-dependent uptake of amino acids in P. pastoris, which might contribute to the poor growth of GS115 on methanol.</p></details></div>

This is a novel fungal P450 enzyme with 19-hydroxylase activity, which is different from the known steroidal aromatase CYP19 and CYP11B families of enzymes.IMPORTANCE Hydroxylation is one of the most important reactions in steroid functionalization, especially C19-hydroxylation produces a key intermediate for the synthesis of 19-nor-steroid drugs without C19 angular methyl group in three chemo-enzymatic steps, instead of the current industrial process with ten chemical reactions. However, hydroxylation of the C19 angular methyl group remains a very challenging task due to the large steric resistance to the 19 methyl group between the A and B rings. The present study reports a novel fungal P450 enzyme with 19-hydroxylase activity. This opens a new venue for searching effective biocatalysts for the useful steroidal C-19 hydroxylation, although further studies for better understanding of the structural basis underlying regioselectivity and substrate specificity of this fungal steroidal 19-hydroxylase is warranted to facilitate the engineering of this enzyme for the industrial applications.</p></details></div>

Unfortunately, most model systems typically lack expression of a conspecific NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is the electron transfer partner of CYPs. As a result, the activities of heterologously expressed insect CYPs may not accurately reflect detoxification activities in vivo. Previously, CYP6B7 from Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (HaCYP6B7) has been expressed in the Pichia pastoris GS115 strain and shown to detoxify bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos. However, it remains to be determined if co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with HaCPR will enhance the detoxification ability of the expression system. In the present study, HaCYP6B7 and HaCPR genes were co-expressed in P. pastoris using a reconstituted expression vector, pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-HaCPR. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot, and the detoxification activities of microsomal fractions to p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (PNOD), 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD), fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos were measured. Co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with HaCPR resulted in PNOD and ECOD activities of 1.90 nmol/min/mg.protein and 12.39 pmol/min/mg.protein, which were 1.6- and 1.5-fold of that catalyzed by HaCYP6B7 expressed alone, respectively. Furthermore, microsomes of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-HaCPR-GS115 had higher detoxification activity than that of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-GS115 to fenvalerate, but not chlorpyrifos. The results indicated that co-expression of HaCYP6B7 with conspecific CPR could enhance the detoxification activities to some substrates comparing with expression of HaCYP6B7 alone.</p></details></div>

But recently, 3G biofuels, based in algae biomass, have emerged as a great alternative for production of energy. Results: In this work, a versatile beta-glucosidase from the ascomycete fungus Talaromyces amestolkiae has been purified, characterized, and heterologously expressed. The synthesis of this beta-glucosidase (BGL-3) was not induced by cellulose, and the presence of a specific carbon source is not required for its production, which is uncommon for beta-glucosidases. BGL-3, which was obtained from a basal medium with glucose as carbon source, was profusely secreted under carbon starvation conditions, which was corroborated by qRT-PCR assays. BGL-3 was purified from T. amestolkiae cultures in one step, and biochemically characterized. The enzyme showed high thermal stability, and very high efficiency on pNPG (Km of 0.14 mM and Vmax of 381.1 U/mg), cellobiose (Km of 0.48 mM and Vmax of 447.1 U/mg), and other cello-oligosaccharides. Surprisingly, it also showed remarkable ability to hydrolyze laminarin, a beta-1,3-glucan present in algae. The recombinant enzyme, obtained in the yeast Pichia pastoris, exhibited kinetic and physicochemical properties similar to those found for the native protein. Enzyme efficiency was examined in wheat straw saccharification processes, in which BGL-3 worked better supplementing Celluclast 1.5L than the commercial cellulase cocktail N-50010. Besides, BGL-3 hydrolyzed laminarin more efficiently than a commercial laminarinase. Conclusions: A very efficient 1,4-beta-glucosidase, which also showed activity over 1,3-beta-glucose bonds, has been produced, purified, and characterized. This is the first report of such versatility in a 1,4-beta-glucosidase. The application of this enzyme for saccharification of wheat straw and laminarin and its comparison with commercial enzymes suggest that it could be an interesting tool for the production of 2G and 3G biofuels.</p></details></div>

Activation of the mating response requires the secretion of a- and alpha-factor pheromones, which bind to G-protein coupled receptors on cells of opposite mating type. In K. phaffii, the genes coding for the alpha-factor (MFalpha), the pheromone surface receptors and the conserved a-factor biogenesis pathway have been annotated previously. Initial homology based search failed to identify potential a-factor genes (MFA). By using transcriptome data of heterothallic strains under mating conditions we found two K. phaffii a-factor genes. Deletion of both MFA genes prevented mating of a-type cells. MFA single mutants were still able to mate and activate the mating response pathway in alpha-type cells. A reporter assay was used to confirm the biological activity of synthetic a- and alpha-factor peptides. The identification of the a-factor genes enabled the first characterization of the role and regulation of the mating pheromone genes and the response of K. phaffii to synthetic pheromones and will help to gain a better understanding of the mating behavior of K. phaffii.</p></details></div>

As nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce, cellulose is expected to become a major raw material for food, energy, fuel and other products. 1,4-beta-glucosidase (Bgl), as a kind of cellulose, can be degraded cellulose into industrial available glucose. In this study, we constructed mutants of Bgl with enhanced activity based on homology modeling, molecular docking, and the site-directed mutagenesis of target residues to modify spatial positions, steric hindrances, or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. On the basis of the high-activity mutations were got (N347S and G235M) by using site-directed mutagenesis and screening methods and introduced in the Pichia pastoris expression system, the enzymatic properties of mutant enzymes were analysed. Assays of the activity of the purified Bgl revealed that the two mutants exhibited increased activity. The pPICZalphaA-G235M and pPICZalphaA-N347S mutants exhibited a >33.4% and 44.8% increase in specific activity respectively, with similar pH, temperature and metal ion requirements, compared to wild-type Bgl.

We compared the optimized expression of monomers of the unique HPV type 16 L1-L2 chimeric protein (SAF) in two yeast strains of Pichia pastoris, KM71 (Mut(s) ) and GS115 (Mut(+) ), with Hansenula polymorpha NCYC 495 to determine the preferred host in bioreactors. SAF was uniquely created by replacing the h4 helix of the HPV-16 capsid L1 protein with a L2 peptide. Two different feeding strategies in fed-batch cultures of P. pastoris Mut(s) were evaluated: a predetermined feed rate versus feeding based on the oxygen consumption by maintaining constant dissolved oxygen levels (DO stat). All cultures showed a significant increase in biomass when methanol was fed using the DO stat method. In P. pastoris the SAF concentrations were higher in the Mut(s) strains than in the Mut(+) strains. However, H. polymorpha produced the highest level of SAF at 132.10 mg.L(-1) culture while P. pastoris Mut(s) only produced 23.61 mg.L(-1) . H. polymorpha showed greater potential for the expression of HPV-16 L1/L2 chimeric proteins despite the track record of P. pastoris as a high level producer of heterologous proteins.</p></details></div>

The combination of parallelizable ion analysis without time loss together with different fragmentation techniques (HCD/CID) and an inclusion list led to higher quality in lipid identifications exemplified in human plasma and yeast samples. Moreover, we used lipidome isotope labeling of yeast (LILY) - a fast and efficient in vivo labeling strategy in Pichia pastoris - in order to produce (non-radioactive) isotopically labeled eukaryotic lipid standards in yeast. We integrated the (13)C lipids in the LC-MS workflow to enable relative and absolute compound-specific quantification in yeast and human plasma samples by isotope dilution. Label-free and compound-specific quantification was validated by comparison against a recent international interlaboratory study on human plasma SRM 1950. In this way, we were able to prove accuracy of quantification enabled by the LILY approach in complex matrix such as human plasma. Excellent analytical figures of merit with enhanced trueness, precision and linearity over 4-5 orders of magnitude were observed applying compound-specific quantification with (13)C-labeled lipids. We strongly believe that lipidomics studies will benefit from incorporating isotope dilution and LC-MSn strategies.</p></details></div>

Golgins are large Golgi resident proteins, primarily reported to play role in cargo vesicle capture, but details of such mechanisms are yet to be deciphered. Golgins that localize to the Golgi via their GRIP domain, a C-terminal Golgi anchoring domain, are known as GRIP domain Golgins. In this present study, we have identified and functionally characterized homolog of one such GRIP domain Golgin protein, Imh1, from the budding yeast Pichia pastoris. We have demonstrated that the GRIP domain present at C-terminal of Pichia pastoris Imh1 (PpImh1) functions as its Golgi-targeting sequence. Using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, Dynamic Light Scattering and Electron Microscopy, we have shown that PpImh1 can self-associate and form a homodimer. Analysis of purified recombinant PpImh1 by CD spectroscopy indicates presence of 85% alpha-helical structure, a characteristics of high content alpha helical coiled-coil sequences normally present in other Golgin family proteins. Two-hybrid analysis indicated self-interaction between C-terminal fragments, yet N terminal fragments do not mediate any such form of self-interaction, suggesting that PpImh1 may form a parallel dimer. Electron Microscopy data indicates, PpImh1 forms extended rod-like homo-dimeric molecules with splayed N terminal end which can act as a tether for capturing vesicles. Our study, provide first evidence in support of the dimeric Y shaped structure for any Golgin in the budding yeast.</p></details></div>

Results showed that FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2 comprised 342-bp encoding peptides of 113 amino acids, which shared a high homology with other Ganoderma FIPs.

For example, methanol can be metabolized by other pathways to produce ethanol, which acts as an inhibitor of the heterologous protein production pathway; oxygen concentration can generate aerobic or anaerobic environments and affects the fermentation rate; and temperature affects the central carbon metabolism and stress response protein folding. The main goal of this study was determine the implication of free fatty acids on the production of heterologous proteins in different culture conditions in cultures of Pichia pastoris. We evaluated cell viability using propidium iodide by flow cytometry and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances to measure cell membrane damage. The results indicate that the use of low temperatures and low methanol concentrations favors the decrease in lipid peroxidation in the transition phase from glycerol to methanol. In addition, a temperature of 14 degrees C+1%M provided the most stable viability. By contrast, the temperature of 18 degrees C+1.5%M favored the production of a higher antibody fragment concentration. In summary, these results demonstrate that the decrease in lipid peroxidation is related to an increased production of free fatty acids.</p></details></div>

Previously we obtained recombinant soluble human rhIFN-lambda1 from Pichia pastoris. However, the hyper-glycosylation from P. pastoris brings immunogenicity and low purification recovery rate. To overcome this disadvantage, in this study, we constructed an rhIFN-lambda1 mutant (rhIFN-lambda1-Nm) devoid of the potential N-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. rhIFN-lambda1-Nm was successfully expressed and secreted extracellularly in P. pastoris (GS115) using methanol inducible AOX1 promoter with alpha-mating factor signal sequence. rhIFN-lambda1-Nm was purified and characterized. There was no significant difference between rhIFN-lambda1-Nm and rhIFN-lambda1 in structure and bioactivity. The molecular weight was low after N-glycosylation mutation whereas the glycosylation was much lower. The mutational rhIFN-lambda1 (rhIFN-lambda1-Nm) could legitimately be developed as substitutes for rhIFN-lambda1, and thus it may be developed into a more promising therapeutic reagent in the future.</p></details></div>

The secretory recombinant plasmid pPIC9-gp85 containing ALV-J gp85 gene was designed and was transfected into the genome of P. pastoris (GS115) cells. The recombinant plasmid was expressed under the induction of methanol. The expressed products in the medium of the cells were purified and identified with endoglycosidase digestion assay and western blot mediated with monoclonal antibody (MAb) JE9. The purified product combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant was inoculated intramuscularly into 7-day-old chickens and three booster inoculations were performed on 21 days post first inoculation (dpfi), 42, and 56 dpfi. The antibody responses and cellular immune responses were detected, and the protective effects were analyzed after challenge with ALV-J. The results showed that the secretory pPIC9-gp85 plasmid was successfully constructed and could be stably expressed in GS115 cells. The expressed products were N-acetylglucosylated and could specifically combine with MAb (JE9). The secreted gp85 protein combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could induce higher antibody response and spleen lymphocyte proliferation response and IFN-gamma-inducing response, and could protect all the inoculated chickens against the viremia and the immunosuppressive lesions caused by ALV-J challenge. The results of neutralizing test in vitro suggested that the antisera with some ALV-J antibody titers could neutralize ALV-J strain and inhibit the growth of virus in vitro. The result of IFA showed that IgG antibody in the antisera could specifically combine with ALV-J strain in cells. It can be concluded that the secretory recombinant gp85 protein, as a new acetylglucosylated gp85 protein, was successfully prepared and combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could protect the inoculated chickens against ALV-J infection. This study first reported the methods on preparing the secretory recombinant ALV-J gp85 protein using P. pastoris and evaluated its immunoprotection.</p></details></div>

Application of lignin degrading enzymes on the lignocellulosic biomass exposes the cellulose for easy digestion by ruminants. Laccases have been found to be considerably effective in improving the digestibility by way of delignification. However, laccase yields from natural hosts are not sufficient for industrial scale applications, which restricts their use. A viable option would be to express the laccase gene in compatible hosts to achieve higher production yields. A codon-optimized synthetic variant of Schizophyllum commune laccase gene was cloned into a pPIC9K vector and expressed in P. pastoris GS115 (his4) under the control of an alcohol oxidase promoter. Colonies were screened for G418 resistance and the methanol utilization phenotype was established. The transformant yielded a laccase activity of 344 U.mL(-1) after 5 days of growth at 30 degrees C (0.019 g.mL(-1) wet cell weight). The laccase protein produced by the recombinant Pichia clone was detected as two bands with apparent molecular weights of 55 kDa and 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Activity staining on native PAGE confirmed the presence of bioactive laccase. Treatment of five common crop residues with recombinant laccase recorded a lignin loss ranging between 1.64% in sorghum stover, to 4.83% in finger millet, with an enhancement in digestibility ranging between 8.71% in maize straw to 24.61% in finger millet straw. Treatment with recombinant laccase was effective in enhancing the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass for ruminant feeding through delignification. To date, a number of hosts have been adventured to produce laccase in large quantities, but, to our knowledge, there are no reports of the expression of laccase protein from Schizophyllum commune in Pichia pastoris, and also on the treatment of crop residues using recombinant laccase for ruminant feeding.</p></details></div>

Fabs are aglycosylated proteins and so many expression platforms have been developed including prokaryotic, yeast and mammalian cells. However, these platforms are not equivalent in terms of cell line development and culture time, product quality and possibly cost of production that greatly influence the success of a drug candidate's pharmaceutical development. This study is an assessment of the humanized Fab fragment ACT017 produced from two microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris) and one mammalian cell host (CHO). Following low scale production and Protein L-affinity purification under generic conditions, physico-chemical and functional quality assessments were carried out prior to economic analysis of industrial scale production using a specialized software (Biosolve, Biopharm Services, UK). Results show higher titer production when using E. coli but associated with high heterogeneity of the protein content recovered in the supernatant. We also observed glycoforms of the Fab produced from P. pastoris, while Fab secreted from CHO was the most homogeneous despite a much longer culture time and slightly higher estimated cost of goods. This study may help inform future pharmaceutical development of this class of therapeutic proteins.</p></details></div>

The bovine enterokinase light chain (bEKL) produced in Pichia pastoris was shown to be a glycoprotein. To study the effects of N-glycosylation on the biochemical properties of bEKL, the enzyme was deglycosylated via site-directed mutagenesis. The results showed that elimination of the N-glycosylation sites of bEKL (N64, N103 and N165) did not significantly affect the protein secretion level in P. pastoris, but it does greatly influence its enzymatic activity. The N64Q increased the specific activity of the enzyme for GD4K-beta-naphthylamide and improved its catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the glycosylated bEKL is more thermostable than its deglycosylated counterparts. Structural analysis of glycosylated and deglycosylated bEKL revealed that the removal of N-glycosylation did not have pronounced changes on the secondary structure but there was a significant difference in the tertiary structure. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the effects of glycosylation at different degrees and sites in bEKL were diverse. Moreover, this work will provide theoretical support for designing enzymes on the basis of N-glycosylation to meet the demands of the biochemical industry.</p></details></div>

Identifying the replication origins is crucial for understanding the mechanism of DNA replication. Although several discriminative computational predictors were proposed to identify DNA replication origins of yeast species, they could only be used to identify very tiny parts (250 bp or 300 bp) of the replication origins. Besides, none of the existing predictors could successfully capture the "GC asymmetry bias" of yeast species reported by experimental observations. And hence it would not be surprised why their power is so limited. To grasp the CG asymmetry feature and make the prediction able to cover the entire replication regions of yeast species, we develop a new predictor called "iRO-3wPseKNC". Results: Rigorous cross-validations on the benchmark datasets from four yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Pichia pastoris) have indicated that the proposed predictor is really very powerful for predicting the entire DNA duplication origins. Availability and implementation: The web-server for the iRO-3wPseKNC predictor is available at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iRO-3wPseKNC/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

A large amount of recombinant enzyme secreted by the P. pastoris GS115 strain was purified to homogeneity. The molecular weight of the purified endoglucanase is about 55.0 kDa. The AgCMCase exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. However, it remained relatively stable at temperatures ranging from 45 to 80 degrees C and pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0. In addition, it showed higher activity at extreme NaCl concentrations from 1.0 to 4.0 M, suggesting it is an enzyme highly stable under heat, acid, alkaline and saline conditions.

The increased need for phosphate, the decrease of long-chain polyP level, the accumulation of short-chain polyP, and enhanced endopolyphosphatase activity in the crude membrane fraction were observed in methanol-grown cells compared with glucose-grown cells of both species. Transcriptome analysis revealed notable differences in the expression patterns of key genes encoding proteins related to polyP metabolism.

A one-time characterization of process-related impurities from product expression in Pichia pastoris was first carried out using linear salt and pH gradients on a library of multimodal, salt-tolerant, and hydrophobic charge induction chromatographic resins. The Reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis of the fractions from these gradients was then used to generate large data sets of impurity profiles. A retention database of the biological product was also generated using the same linear salt and pH gradients on these resins, without fraction collection. The resulting two data sets were then analyzed using an in silico tool, which incorporated integrated manufacturing constraints to generate and rank potential three-step purification sequences based on their predicted purification performance as well as whole-process "orthogonality" for impurity removal. Highly ranked sequences were further examined to identify templates for process development. The efficacy of this approach was successfully demonstrated for the rapid development of robust integrated processes for human growth hormone and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.</p></details></div>

To meet the demands for considerable amount of highly pure BLIP, this study aimed at developing an efficient expression system in eukaryotic Pichia pastoris (a methylotrophic yeast) for production of BLIP. With methanol induction, recombinant BLIP was overexpressed in P. pastoris X-33 and secreted into the culture medium. A high yield of ~ 300 mg/L culture secretory BLIP recovered from the culture supernatant without purification was found to be > 90% purity. The recombinant BLIP was fully active and showed an inhibition constant (Ki) for TEM-1 beta-lactamase (0.55 +/- 0.07 nM) comparable to that of the native S. clavuligerus-expressed BLIP (0.5 nM). Yeast-produced BLIP in combination with ampicillin effectively inhibited the growth of beta-lactamase-producing Gram-positive Bacillus. Our approach of expressing secretory BLIP in P. pastoris gave 71- to 1200-fold more BLIP with high purity than the other conventional methods, allowing efficient production of large amount of highly pure BLIP, which merits fundamental science studies, drug development and biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

In the present study, single- and four-CRD-containing galectins were identified in oyster Crassostrea gigas (designated CgGal-2 and CgGal-3). The open reading frames (ORFs) of CgGal-2 and CgGal-3 encode polypeptides of 200 and 555 amino acids, respectively. All CRDs of CgGal-3 include two consensus motifs essential for ligand-binding, and a novel motif is present in CgGal-2. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) profiles were determined for recombinant rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3, and rCgGal-2 displayed low binding affinity for PAMPs, while rCgGal-3 bound various PAMPs including glucan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and peptidoglycan (PGN) with relatively high affinity. Furthermore, rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3 exhibited different microbe binding profiles; rCgGal-2 bound to Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Vibrio vulnificus) and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), while rCgGal-3 bound to these microbes but also to Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus). In addition, rCgGal-3 possessed microbial agglutinating activity and coagulation activity against fungi and erythrocytes, respectively, but rCgGal-2 lacked any agglutinating activity. Carbohydrate binding specificity analysis showed that rCgGal-3 specifically bound D-galactose. Furthermore, rCgGal-2 and rCgGal-3 functioned as opsonin participating in the clearance against invaders in C. gigas. Thus, CgGal-2 with one CRD and CgGal-3 with four CRDs are new members of the galectin family involved in immune responses against bacterial infection. Differences in the organisation and amino acid sequences of CRDs may affect their specificity and affinity for nonself substances.</p></details></div>

Purified recombinant phytase displayed all its biochemical properties similar to wild type. Molecular modeling and docking of phytase with various substrates showed differential binding patterns with GoldScore values ranging from 40.61 to 79.78. Docking with different substrates revealed strong binding affinity with ATP and phytic acid, while the lowest with AMP and phosphoenol pyruvate. This was further confirmed using biochemical assays, as the recombinant enzyme displayed broad substrate specificity. Docking with inhibitors also showed differential binding with GoldScore values ranging from 22.94 (2,3-butanedione) to 85.72 (myo-inositol hexasulphate). Validation using biochemical analysis revealed that both 2,3-butanedione and phenyl glyoxal inhibited the phytase activity significantly. Furthermore, presence of inorganic phosphate in the reaction mixture also inhibited the phytase activity, as there was no activity at and beyond 0.8mM. Docking of phytase with metavanadate showed binding at the same atom in the active-site where the substrate i.e. phytic acid binds. Vanadium incorporation resulted in the catalytic conversion of phytase into a peroxidase with concomitant inhibition of phytase activity. Peroxidase activity was high in acidic range and the product formation showed correlation with reaction time. Furthermore, molecular modeling and docking of recombinant HAP-phytase of a thermophilic mould S. thermophile reveals insights into molecular catalysis that is validated by the biochemical properties.</p></details></div>

The limited supply and potential infectious pathogen contamination of pHSA have stimulated the development of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA). However, rHSA often entraps endogenous or exogenous impurities, including color pigments and polysaccharides. Therefore, the purification of rHSA to high purity remains the bottleneck in large-scale production of rHSA. Herein we report a novel two-step purification protocol for rHSA generated from Pichia pastoris. In the first step, rHSA was partially unfolded to expose impurities entrapped into rHSA and was then removed. In the second step, rHSA was crystallized to further remove impurities. Through this procedure, the pigment content (A350/A280) and polysaccharides content of rHSA were reduced to 0.0141 and 0.253mug/mg, respectively, which were comparable to pHSA. In addition, the secondary structure and bioactivity of purified rHSA are preserved. The purification procedure developed in this study is a simple, short and low cost method to produce active rHSA, or rHSA-fusion proteins, to high purity, and also suitable for the purification of other disulfide-rich proteins.</p></details></div>

We report here the cloning and expression of lamprey (l)GpB5, and its ability to heterodimerize with lGpA2 to form a functional l-thyrostimulin. The full-length cDNA of lGpB5 encodes 174 amino acids with ten conserved cysteine residues and one glycosylation site that is conserved with other vertebrate GpB5 sequences. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses support that lGpB5 belongs to the vertebrate GpB5 clade. Heterodimerization of lGpB5 and lGpA2 was shown by nickel pull-down of histidine-tagged recombinant subunits. RNA transcripts of lGpB5 were detected in the pituitary of lampreys during both parasitic and adult life stages. Intraperitoneal injection with lGnRH-III (100mug/kg) increased pituitary lGpA2, lGpB5, and lGpHbeta mRNA expression in sexually mature, adult female lampreys. A recombinant l-thyrostimulin produced by expression of a fusion gene in Pichia pastoris activated lamprey GpH receptors I and II as measured by cAMP enzymeimmunoassay. In contrast to jawed vertebrates that have pituitary LH, FSH, and TSH, our data support that lampreys only have two functional pituitary GpHs, lGpH and l-thyrostimulin, which consist of lGpA2 and unique beta subunits.

HNP1 plays a crucial role in controlling bacterial infections, particularly by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, through membrane perforation patterns. The structural characteristics of HNP1's three intramolecular disulfide bridges cause difficulty in its synthesis via chemical methods. In this study, bioactive recombinant HNP1 was produced using the Pichia pastoris (P. Pichia) expression system. HNP1 was fused with the polyhedrin of Bombyx mori and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to prevent HNP1 toxicity in yeast host cells under direct expression. An enterokinase protease cleavage site (amino acid sequence DDDDK) was designed upstream of the HNP1 peptide to obtain the antibacterial peptide HNP1 with native structure after it was cleaved by the enterokinase. The fusion HNP1 protein (FHNP1) was successfully expressed and had a molecular mass of approximately 62.6 kDa, as determined using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Then, the recovered FHNP1 was digested and purified; Tricine-SDS-PAGE results showed that HNP1 was successfully released from FHNP1. Functional analysis of induction against antibiotic-resistant Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) showed that it was challenging for HNP1 to acquire resistance to the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori. Moreover, in vitro studies showed that HNP1 exerted a strong effect against antibiotic-resistant H. pylori activity. Furthermore, the animal model of H. pylori infection established in vivo showed that HNP1 significantly reduced the colonization of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori in the stomach.

To overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression, here we report the production of recombinant hLysG2 (rhLysG2) using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host. The strong inducible alcoholoxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter was used to drive expression of the optimized hLysG2 gene. Under the optimal expression conditions, the lytic activity of rhLysG2 reached 113 U/mL of culture supernatant in shake flask cultivation and this was increased to 2084 U/mL in fed-batch fermentation. Using chitin affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography, rhLysG2 was produced with a yield of 137mg/L, purity of>99%, molecular weight of 21,504.6Da, and specific activity of 13,500U/mg. In vitro assays indicated that rhLysG2 possessed muramidase activity, isopeptidase activity, and free radical scavenging activity. This report describes an efficient strategy for the production of biologically active rhLysG2 in P. pastoris on a large scale with a high yield, which provides a solid foundation for possible future pharmaceutical applications.</p></details></div>

In the present study, the full-length cDNA sequence of a novel sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus invertebrate-type lysozyme (sp-iLys) was synthesized according to the codon usage bias of Pichia pastoris and was cloned into a constitutive expression plasmid pPIC9K. The resulting plasmid, pPIC9K-sp-iLys, was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris strain GS115. The bioactive recombinant sp-iLys was successfully secreted into the culture broth by positive transformants. The highest lytic activity of 960 U/mL of culture supernatant was reached in fed-batch fermentation. Using chitin affinity chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography, recombinant sp-iLys was produced with a yield of 94.5 mg/L and purity of > 99%. Recombinant sp-iLys reached its peak lytic activity of 8560 U/mg at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C and showed antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Aeromonas hydrophila) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis). In addition, recombinant sp-iLys displayed isopeptidase activity which reached the peak at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C with the presence of 0.05 M Na(+). In conclusion, this report describes the heterologous expression of recombinant sp-iLys in P. pastoris on a preparative-scale, which possesses lytic activity and isopeptidase activity.

The windmill palm tree Trachycarpus fortunei produces one of the most stable and fastest peroxidases (WPTP) characterized to date; however, an economical source is needed. Pichia pastoris has been used as an expression system for WPTP and other peroxidases. However, yeast and plants synthesize different types of N-linked glycan structures and may differ the level of glycosylation at each site. Such non-native glycosylation can have unwanted consequences. Glycosylation site N256 was under-glycosylated in the wild-type (1.5%) compared to the native enzyme (55%); therefore, we mutated WPTP to promote glycosylation at this site (WPTP E254G). Glycosylation increased four-fold, as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mutation did not change the substrate specificity and optimal pH- and thermo-stability ranges, but it increased the catalytic activity 2-3-fold. In comparison with wild-type WPTP, WPTP E254G showed a shift of the most stable pH from 7 to 9, making it suitable for applications under alkaline conditions.</p></details></div>

Currently, MPS II patients are mainly treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant enzymes produced in mammalian cells. As an alternative, several studies have shown the production of active and therapeutic forms of lysosomal proteins in microorganisms. In this paper, we report the production and characterization of a recombinant IDS produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris (prIDS). We evaluated the effect of culture conditions and gene sequence optimization on prIDS production. The results showed that the highest production of prIDS was obtained at oxygen-limited conditions using a codon-optimized IDS cDNA. The purified enzyme showed a final activity of 12.45 nmol mg(-1) H(-1) and an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kDa. The highest stability was achieved at pH 6.0, and prIDS also showed high stability in human serum. Noteworthy, the enzyme was taken up by culture cells in a dose-dependent manner through mannose receptors, which allowed the delivery of the enzyme to the lysosome. In summary, these results show the potential of Pichia pastoris as a host to produce an IDS intended for a MPS II ERT.</p></details></div>

The open reading frame (ORF) of AjFL-1 was of 546 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 181 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 20kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of AjFL-1 shared 30%-40% similarity with the fucolectins from other animals. There were a typical F-type lectin domain (FLD) (residues 39-180) and a signal peptide (residues 1-24) in AjFL-1. The mRNA transcript of AjFL-1 could be detected by qRT-PCR in various tissues, such as intestinum, coelomocytes, respiratory tree, tentacle, and body wall, while undetectable in the gonads and longitudinal muscle. The mRNA expression level of AjFL-1 in coelomocytes was significantly up-regulated (47.06-fold to that in control group, p<0.05) at 12h after Vibrio splendidus challenge. Immunofluorescence assay showed that AjFL-1 protein was mainly distributed on the membrane, while few in cytoplasm of coelomocytes in sea cucumber. The recombinant AjFL-1 (rAjFL-1) could bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), mannan (MAN) and fucose (FUC), and exhibited a broader binding activities towards Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus, as well fungus Pichia pastoris.

In this work, the peptide ligands were synthesized on Toyopearl chromatographic resins and utilized for purifying recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) from complex sources. Elution buffer pH and composition were optimized to maximize the recovery of standard rHuEPO from the peptide resins. The peptide-based adsorbents were employed for separating rHuEPO from a mixture of albumin, myoglobin, and IgG to examine their selectivity. When using FSLLHH, the inclusion of low amounts of surfactants in the wash and elution buffers facilitated the recovery of rHuEPO with high yield and purity. Specifically, FSLLSH and VVFFVH afforded the most efficient separation of rHuEPO, with yield and purity of 85% and 95-97%, respectively. The affinity resins were also utilized to purify rHuEPO from spiked CHO cell culture fluid. In particular, FSLLSH provided the most successful separation from CHO, with yield and purity above 90%, and 1.0 log10 reduction of host cell proteins. The influence of conductivity and pH in the CHO-rHuEPO load was investigated. Finally, FSLLSH-based resins were used to purify rHuEPO spiked into a Pichia pastoris cell culture fluid, resulting in product yield and purity of 96% and 84%, respectively, and 1.3 log10 reduction of host DNA. These results compare well with values obtained using wheat germ agglutinin agarose and clearly indicate the potential of the cyclic peptide resins as a viable tool for rHuEPO purification.</p></details></div>

Gene database analyses shows that GH62 family only contains specific alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases that play an important role in the degradation and structure of the plant cell wall. At present, there are only 22 enzymes in this group has been characterized. In this study, we cloned a novel alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosidase gene (poabf62a) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 62 from Penicillium oxalicum sp. 68 and expressed it in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of recombinant PoAbf62A was estimated to be 32.9 kDa. Using p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pNPalphaAbf) as substrate, purified PoAbf62A exhibited an optimal pH of 4.5 and temperature of 35 degrees C. Results of methylation and (13)C NMR analyses showed that PoAbf62A was exclusively alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosidase, specific for cleavage of alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues, and with the absence of activity towards alpha-1,2-arabinofuranose and alpha-1,5-arabinofuranose. Therefore, PoAbf62A exhibits high activity on sugar beet arabinan and wheat arabinoxylan, because their branched side chain are decorated with alpha-1,3-arabinofuranose. On the other hand, there is a lack of activity with linear-alpha-L-1,5-arabinan and xylan that only contained alpha-L-1,5-arabinofuranose or beta-1,4-xylose. The alpha-1,3-arabinofuranosidase activity identified here provides a new biocatalytic tool to degrade hemicellulose and analyze the structure of plant cell walls.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a novel Astakine gene was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (designated as EsAst). The full-length cDNA of EsAst was of 1163 bp, consisting of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 120 bp, a 3' UTR of 656 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 387 bp encoding a polypeptide of 128amino acids. There were a signal peptide and a prokineticin domain with nine conserved cysteine residues in the deduced amino acid sequence of EsAst. EsAst shared higher similarity with Astakines from Penaeus monodon and Pacifastacus leniusculus, and it was closely clustered with the Astakine from shrimp P. monodon in the phylogenetic tree. The EsAst mRNA transcript was higher expressed in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was continuously increased from 1.5 to 48h after Vibro anguillarum challenge compared that in the untreated control group. After Pichia pastoris GS115 challenge, the relative expression level of EsAst in hemocytes was also up-regulated. After rEsAst injection, ROS levels in HPT cells were also increased at 12 and 24h, and the total hemocyte counts were also significantly increased at 6, 9, 12, and 24h post rEsAst injection. The interference of EsAst expression with dsRNA injection could delay the recovery of hemocytes production post A. hydrophila stimulation. When mitochondrial complexes I was knock down by dsRNA, ROS levels were decreased and THCs were also decreased. Recovery of hemocyte production inducing by A. hydrophila stimulation and rEsAst injection were delayed with dsEsbc1 injection. When ROS levels were increased after RNAi of Lon protease, THCs were also increased. The expression levels of five genes (EsJNK, EsSTAT, EsPI3K, EsAKT1, EsP70S6K) involved in SAPK-JNK and mTOR signaling pathways were up-regulated at 12 and 24h in rEsAst group and EsLon dsRNA group compared with that in EGFP dsRNA group, and were similar to the trend of ROS levels.

The maximum intracellular beta-d-mannanase activity obtained from the cell-free extract was approximately 40.0U/mL after 72h of cultivating a P. pastoris transformant (pPICZ-man) induced with methanol. Hydrolysis of native LBG galactomannan with 8U/mL beta-d-mannanase for 24h significantly decreased the weight-average molecular weight of LBG galactomannan from 5,580,010 to 3188.

The biological activity of these molecules is related to their size and acetylation degree. Chitinase Chit42 from Trichoderma harzianum hydrolyses chitin oligomers with a minimal of three N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units. Gene chit42 was previously characterized, and according to its sequence, the encoded protein included in the structural Glycoside Hydrolase family GH18.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Chit42 was expressed in Pichia pastoris using fed-batch fermentation to about 3 g/L. Protein heterologously expressed showed similar biochemical properties to those expressed by the natural producer (42 kDa, optima pH 5.5-6.5 and 30-40 degrees C). In addition to hydrolyse colloidal chitin, this enzyme released reducing sugars from commercial chitosan of different sizes and acetylation degrees. Chit42 hydrolysed colloidal chitin at least 10-times more efficiently (defined by the kcat/Km ratio) than any of the assayed chitosan. Production of partially acetylated chitooligosaccharides was confirmed in reaction mixtures using HPAEC-PAD chromatography and mass spectrometry.

In this study, a xylanase gene (xyn10A), predicted to encode a hydrolase domain of GH10, a linker region and a CBM1 domain, was cloned from a superior lignocellulose degrading strain Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. Xyn10A has a specific xylanase activity of 34.4 U mg(-1), and is optimally active at 90 degrees C and pH 6.0. Xyn10A shows quite stable at pHs ranging from 3.0 to 11.0, and keeps over 40% of xylanase activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 1 h. Removal of CBM1 domain has a slight negative effect on its thermostability, but the further cleavage of linker region significantly decreased its stability at high temperature. The transfer of CBM1 and linker region to another GH10 xylanase can help to increase the thermostability. In addition, hydrolase domains between the two Xyn10A proteins naturally formed a dimer structure, which became more thermostable after removing the CBM1 or/and linker region. This thermostable Xyn10A is a suitable candidate for the highly efficient fungal enzyme cocktails for biomass conversion.</p></details></div>

Multiple plasmids, which contains four copies of EG1, were constructed by isocaudamers, resulted a recombinant strain with EG1 activity up to 39.6 U/mL, 262% higher than that measured in the strain containing only a single copy. A significant increase in activity (151%) was found when eight copies of EG1 was introduced into a different host, compared with a host harboring four copies. Further overexpression of the HAC1 transcription factor in the host harboring eight EG1 copies led to activity of 91.9 U/mL, which is 619% higher than that measured in the original strain. Finally, EG1 activity of 650.1 U/mL was achieved in a 3-L scaled-up fed-batch fermenter and the protein yield was 4.05g/L.

A promising approach for producing chitosans with defined degrees of polymerization (DP), degrees of acetylation (DA), and patterns of acetylation (PA) involves using chitin-modifying enzymes. One such enzyme, the chitinase Tv-ECH1 belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18, seems to have an important role in the biocontrol properties of the fungus Trichoderma virens, suggesting its potential in generating novel chitosans for plant health applications. In this study, the Tv-ECH1 enzyme was overexpressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, yielding large amounts (up to 2mgmL(-1)) of purified recombinant enzyme of high activity, high purity, and high stability, making the system promising for industrial production of Tv-ECH1. The purified Tv-ECH1 chitinase displayed a wide optimal pH range from 4.5 to 6 and an optimal temperature of 37 degrees C. Detailed subsite specificity analyses revealed high preference for acetylated residues at all four subsites analyzed (-2, -1, +1, +2), making Tv-ECH1 a promising candidate for the biotechnological production of specific chitosan oligomers and for the characterization of chitosan polymers via enzymatic fingerprinting.</p></details></div>

Our findings substantiate the necessity of a suitable screening system when interfering with the secretory network of K. phaffii. We found that co-production of the chaperones CNE1p and Kar2p, the foldase PDI1p, the UPR-activator Hac1p as well as the FAD synthetase FAD1p enhanced THCAS activity levels within the K. phaffii cells. The strongest influence showed co-expression of Hac1s - increasing the volumetric THCAS activities 4.1-fold on average. We also combined co-production of Hac1p with the other beneficial helper proteins to further enhance THCAS activity levels. An optimized strain overexpressing Hac1s, FAD1 and CNE1 was isolated that showed 20-fold increased volumetric, intracellular THCAS activity compared to the starting strain. We used this strain for a whole cell bioconversion of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) to THCA.

The increasing need for highly purified and biologically active hCKMB in the field of diagnostics makes its production valuable. Currently, the production of hCKMB is mainly achieved in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, because the production in Escherichia coli is challenging and generally yields an inactive enzyme with a low quantity. With the aim of finding the best way for the high-yield production of active hCKMB in E. coli, an efficient strategy was developed using a construct allowing tandem expression of each subunit with 2 different tags. The strategy allowed the efficient expression and separate characterization of each subunit and 1-step purification of the heterodimeric protein into homogeneity. The heterodimeric protein displayed more than 11-fold greater specific activity than the commercially available one. The production strategy described in this study shows a clear advantage over the currently used ones and can be made available not only for laboratory scale production but also for commercial production. Our study is also a well-suited example for the studies in which novel protein expression strategies are needed to achieve greater yields with higher purities.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp.) is a popular cell factory for recombinant protein production. Yeasts in general provide a good starting point for cell factory engineering. They are intrinsically robust and easy to manipulate and cultivate. However, their secretory pathway is not evolutionarily adapted to high loads of secretory protein. In particular, more complex proteins, like the antibody fragment (Fab) used in this study, overwhelm the folding and secretion capacity. This triggers cellular stress responses, which may cause excessive intracellular degradation. Previous results have shown that, in fact, about 60 % of the newly synthesized Fab is intracellularly degraded. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is one possible intracellular degradation pathway for proteins aimed for secretion. We therefore targeted ERAD for cell factory engineering and investigated the impact on recombinant protein secretion in P. pastoris. Three components of the ERAD-L complex, which is involved in the degradation of luminal proteins, and a protein involved in proteasomal degradation, were successfully disrupted in Fab-secreting P. pastoris. Contrary to expectation, the effect on secretion was marginal. In the course of more detailed investigation of the impact of ERAD, we took a closer look at the intracellular variants of the recombinant protein. This enabled us to further zero in on the issue of intracellular Fab degradation and exclude an overshooting ER quality control. We propose that a major fraction of the Fab is actually degraded before entering the secretory pathway.</p></details></div>

Despite its highly selective mechanism of action, the presence of this flavooxidase in different biotechnological settings has hitherto been hampered by the lack of appropriate heterologous expression systems. We recently described the functional expression of the AAO from Pleurotus eryngii in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by fusing a chimeric signal peptide (prealphaproK) and applying structure-guided evolution. Here, we have obtained an AAO secretion variant that is readily expressed in S. cerevisiae and overproduced in Pichia pastoris. First, the functional expression of AAO in S. cerevisiae was enhanced through the in vivo shuffling of a panel of secretion variants, followed by the focused evolution of the prealphaproK peptide. The outcome of this evolutionary campaign-an expression variant that accumulated 4 mutations in the chimeric signal peptide, plus two mutations in the mature protein- showed 350-fold improved secretion (4.5 mg/L) and was stable. This secretion mutant was cloned into P. pastoris and fermented in a fed-batch bioreactor to enhance production to 25 mg/L. While both recombinant AAO from S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris were subjected to the same N-terminal processing and had a similar pH activity profile, they differed in their kinetic parameters and thermostability. The strong glycosylation observed in the evolved AAO from S. cerevisiae underpinned this effect, since when the mutant was produced in the glycosylation-deficient S. cerevisiae strain Deltakre2, its kinetic parameters and thermostability were comparable to its poorly glycosylated P. pastoris recombinant counterpart.</p></details></div>

Previously it was expressed in Escherichia coli; however, the E. coli-derived recombinant VpDef did not show effective antimicrobial activity against Staphyloccocus aureus or the Gram-negative bacteria tested. As such, the goal of this study was to design, express, and purify a recombinant VpDef (rVpDef) in Pichia pastoris and to determine its antibacterial potency and stability. A 6.9KDa rVpDef was successfully expressed as a secreted peptide in P. pastoris, and the amount of rVpDef accumulation was shown to reach as high as approximate 60mug per 1ml of culture medium only after an initial optimization was performed. The purified rVpDef demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was active against six typical common bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. A minimal inhibition concentration of as low as 50mug/ml was observed for rVpDef against the growth of E. coli O157 (ATCC 35150). Moreover, rVpDef was tolerant to temperature shock and proteinase digestion and maintained a high stability over a relatively broad pH range. In addition, rVpDef had a low hemolytic activity against rabbit erythrocytes. Taken together, this study demonstrated that rVpDef could be produced in a large-scale manner in P. pastoris and has a good antibacterial activity and suitable stability. This is the first report on heterologous expression of a biologically active VpDef in P. pastoris, supporting its use for both research and application purposes.</p></details></div>

In this work, the codon sequence of HSA was cloned under the control of the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (AOX1) and expressed as a secretory protein in Pichia pastoris. A recombinant strain displaying the highest HSA yield was selected by screening for resistance to the highest concentration of antibiotic G418. After optimizing the induction conditions and additional supplements, the highest yield of HSA reached 1.6 g/L in a shake flask. Performing high density fermentation further improved the highest yield to 8.86 g/L in a fermenter after 96 h of methanol induction. This result is more promising than the previous reports of industrial applications, which reported the highest yield as 92.29 mg/L/h, considering that the space-time yield of rHSA was doubled. In addition, the desired protein was purified by filtration and Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, which yielded a 58% recovery of a product that had over a 96% purity. This study reveals that Pichia pastoris is an excellent system for recombinant human serum albumin expression due to its outstanding expression capacity. In addition, the high efficiency level of rHSA production lays a solid foundation for its use in industrial production.</p></details></div>

Recently, a protein harboring DM9 repeats was identified as mannose-specific lectin (CgCGL1, renamed as CgDM9CP-1) from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. In the present study, another DM9 containing protein was identified from oyster C. gigas (designated as CgDM9CP-2). The open reading frame of CgDM9CP-2 gene was of 432 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids with two tandem DM9 repeats. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgDM9CP-2 shared 60.8% identity with that of CgDM9CP-1. In the unrooted phylogenetic tree, CgDM9CP-2 was closely clustered with CgDM9CP-1, and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate DM9CPs. The mRNA transcripts of CgDM9CP-2 were expressed in all the tested tissues, including mantle, gonad, gills, adductor muscle, hemocytes, and hepatopancreas, with the highest expression level in gills. CgDM9CP-2 protein was mainly distributed on the cytomembrane of oyster hemocytes. After mannose stimulation, the mRNA expression of CgDM9CP-2 in gills was up-regulated to the peak level (5.90-fold of that in SSW group, p<0.05) at 24h, and kept at a significantly higher level compared with that in control group at 6-48h. It significantly increased at 6h (2.33-fold, p<0.05), and 12h (3.08-fold, p<0.05) post Vibrio splendidus stimulation, and then gradually decreased from 48 to 72h (p<0.05) with significant difference comparing with that in control group. The recombinant CgDM9CP-2 protein (rCgDM9CP-2) displayed higher binding affinity to D-(+)-mannose while lower binding affinity to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. rCgDM9CP-2 also exhibited binding activity towards fungi (Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus), and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas hydrophila and V. splendidus). It could agglutinate fungi P. pastoris and Y. lipolytica, and inhibit the growth of P. pastoris, S. aureus, V. anguillarum, and V. splendidus. These results collectively indicated that CgDM9CP-2 not only served as a pattern recognition receptor with a broad range of recognition spectrum, but also involved in inhibiting the growth of invading microbe in the innate immune response of oyster, which would provide further evidence for the function of DM9 domain in the innate immune system.</p></details></div>

We report on the cloning and expression of a recombinant F. gigantica 14-3-3 epsilon protein (rFg14-3-3e), and testing its effects on specific functions of goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> rFg14-3-3e protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were used to examine the reactivity of rFg14-3-3e protein to anti-F. gigantica and anti-rFg14-3-3e antibodies, respectively. Various assays were used to investigate the stimulatory effects of the purified rFg14-3-3e protein on specific functions of goat PBMCs, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, migration, nitric oxide (NO) production, phagocytosis, and apoptotic capabilities. Potential protein interactors of rFg14-3-3e were identified by querying the databases Intact, String, BioPlex and BioGrid. A Total Energy analysis of each of the identified interaction was performed. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using Funcassociate 3.0.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Sequence analysis revealed that rFg14-3-3e protein had 100% identity to 14-3-3 protein from Fasciola hepatica.

Also, this recombinant protein promoted the release of NO and cell apoptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of goat PBMCs and suppressed monocyte phagocytosis. Homology modelling revealed 65% identity between rFg14-3-3e and human 14-3-3 protein YWHAE. GO enrichment analysis of the interacting proteins identified terms related to apoptosis, protein binding, locomotion, hippo signalling and leukocyte and lymphocyte differentiation, supporting the experimental findings.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our data suggest that rFg14-3-3e protein can influence various cellular and immunological functions of goat PBMCs in vitro and may be involved in mediating F. gigantica pathogenesis.

The expression level at the optimal condition (initial pH 7.0, 1.0% final methanol concentration and induction for 72 h at 26 degrees C) was 0.24 mg/mL cell-free broth. Lunasin analog, obtained from purified lunasin-4 protein through enterokinase digestion and ultrafiltration, significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, intracellular signaling array analysis demonstrated down-regulated levels of phosphorylated Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k) and an up-regulated level of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) after lunasin analog treatment. These results suggest that lunasin analog exerted anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells partly via inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR/p70s6k signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study provides a potential strategy for recombinant production of bioactive lunasin in industry.</p></details></div>

By strand specific RNA sequencing, 208 novel long non-coding RNAs were identified and analyzed. Bioinformatic analysis showed potential trans-target genes and cis-regulated genes of 39 differential lncRNAs. Functional annotation and sequence motif analysis indicated that lncRNAs participate in pathways related to methanol degradation and production of the recombinant protein. The differential expression of lncRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR. Lastly, the potential functions of three lncRNAs were evaluated by knockdown of their expression and analysis of the expression levels of target genes.

First, the chondroitin biosynthesis pathway in a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain using sucrose as carbon source was systematically optimized and the titer of chondroitin was significantly enhanced to 7.15 g/L. Then, specific sulfation transformation systems were successfully constructed and optimized by combining the purified aryl sulfotransferase IV (ASST IV), chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST). Chondroitin sulfate A and C were enzymatically transformed from chondroitin at conversion rates of 98% and 96%, respectively.

The recombinant enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and purified as a glyco-protein with apparent molecular mass of 65-75 kDa by SDS-PAGE. After N-deglycosylation, we observed a 42- and 40-kDa band, representing proteins before and after N-terminal signal peptide processing, respectively. Optimal enzymatic activity was observed at pH 4.0 and temperature of 45 degrees C. This enzyme is also significantly thermo-stable, with 90% activity retained after 1 h at 45 degrees C and 70% activity retained after 4 h, even at 50 degrees C. Biochemical characterization revealed that the enzyme has higher substrate specificity for 3-O-linked flavonoid beta-rutinosides like rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, than for 7-O-linked flavonoid beta-rutinoside like hesperidin. However, no activity was found with naringin, diosmin, monoglycosylated chromogenic substrates, and polymeric laminarin substrate.

The black liquor (BL) generated exhibits a high chemical oxygen demand (COD), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and chlorophenol content, along with an augmented colour and increased pH. BL is often discharged into water bodies, where it has a negative impact on the environment. Towards that end, laccases are of great interest for bioremediation, since they can degrade aromatic and non-aromatic compounds while reducing O2 to water instead of H2O2. As such, we evaluated Pleurotus ostreatus and Pichia pastoris (which produces rPOXA 1B laccase) in the treatment of synthetic BL (SBL) in an "in vitro" modified Kraft process followed by CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis. Treating SBL with P. ostreatus viable biomass (VB) followed by CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis resulted in 80.3% COD removal and 70.6% decolourisation. Toxic compounds such as 2-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol, and 2-methoxyphenol were eliminated. Post-treated SBL exhibited low phytotoxicity, as evidenced by a Lactuca sativa L seed germination index (GI) > 50%. Likewise, SBL treatment with P. pastoris followed by VB/CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis resulted in 63.7% COD removal and 46% decolourisation. Moreover, this treatment resulted in the elimination of most unwanted compounds, with the exception of 4-chlorophenol. The Lactuca sativa L seed GI of the post-treated SBL was 40%, indicating moderate phytotoxicity.</p></details></div>

NFAmy13A had a typical signal peptide and shared the highest sequence identity of 64% with alpha-amylase from Aspergillus niger. The recombinant enzyme of NFAmy13A showed an optimal pH at 5.0-5.5 and optimal temperature at 60 degrees C. NFAmy13A was activated and stabilized by Ca(2+), and its half-lives at 60 and 70 degrees C were improved significantly from 1.5 and 0.4 h to 16 and 0.7 h, respectively, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2.

Co-expression of the capsid protein precursor P1 and the protease 3CD of CVA10 in Pichia pastoris resulted in cleavage of P1 into three capsid subunit proteins VP0, VP1, and VP3. These three subunit proteins co-assembled into CVA10 VLPs, which were visualized as spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 30nm under electron microscope. Immunization studies showed that CVA10 VLP could efficiently induce antigen-specific serum antibodies in mice. The anti-VLP sera were able to potently neutralize homologous and heterologous CVA10 strains. Importantly, passively transferred anti-VLP sera fully protected recipient neonatal mice from lethal CVA10 infection. In addition, neonatal mice born to the VLP-immunized dams were also completely protected from CVA10 lethal challenge.

To penetrate the cell wall and thereby to facilitate infection, microbial pathogens are equipped with a wide array of cell wall-degrading enzymes to depolymerize the polysaccharides in the cell wall. However, many of these enzymes and their role in the pathogenesis of microbial pathogens are not characterized, especially those from Oomycetes. In this study, we analyzed the function of four putative endo-beta-1,4-xylanase-encoding genes (ppxyn1-ppxyn4) from Phytophthora parasitica, an oomycete plant pathogen known to cause severe disease in a wide variety of plant species. All four genes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10). Recombinant proteins of ppxyn1, ppxyn2, and ppxyn4 obtained from the yeast Pichia pastoris showed degrading activities toward birch wood xylan, but they behaved differently in terms of the conditions for optimal activity, thermostability, and durability. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed upregulated expression of all four genes, especially ppxyn1 and ppxyn2, during plant infection. In contrast, ppxyn3 was highly expressed in cysts and its close homolog, ppxyn4, in germinating cysts. To uncover the role of ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the pathogenesis of P. parasitica, we generated silencing transformants for these two genes by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing. Silencing ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 reduced the virulence of P. parasitica toward tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and tomato plants. These results demonstrate the crucial role of xylanase-encoding ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the infection process of P. parasitica.</p></details></div>

One candidate organism for lactic acid production is Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for heterologous protein production. Nevertheless, this yeast has a poor fermentative capability that can be modulated by controlling oxygen levels. In a previous study, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was introduced into P. pastoris, enabling this yeast to produce lactic acid. The present study aimed to increase the flow of pyruvate towards the production of lactic acid in P. pastoris. To this end, a strain designated GLp was constructed by inserting the bovine lactic acid dehydrogenase gene (LDHb) concomitantly with the interruption of the gene encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). Aerobic fermentation, followed by micro-aerophilic culture two-phase fermentations, showed that the GLp strain achieved a lactic acid yield of 0.65 g/g. The distribution of fermentation products demonstrated that the acetate titer was reduced by 20% in the GLp strain with a concomitant increase in arabitol production: arabitol increased from 0.025 g/g to 0.174 g/g when compared to the GS115 strain. Taken together, the results show a significant potential for P. pastoris in producing lactic acid. Moreover, for the first time, physiological data regarding co-product formation have indicated the redox balance limitations of this yeast.</p></details></div>

Here, HBHA was expressed by Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) GS115 strain , and the immunogenicity of HBHA was evaluated. Materials and Methods: The HBHA gene of M. tuberculosis was cloned into the pPIC9K plasmid, which was good for electroporation into P. pastoris GS115 strain. Unlabeled HBHA protein was purified using a Sepharose CL-6B column, and its expression was confirmed using anti-HBHA polyclonal antibody from mouse serum. We injected C57BL/6 mice with HBHA/ dimethyldioctadecylammonium/trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (HBHA/DDA/TDB) to investigate the immunogenicity of this potential vaccine. Results: The results demonstrated that HBHA/DDA/TDB has the ability to induce high levels of HBHA-specific IgG antibody and its subclasses, as well as interferon-gamma, compared with injection of phosphate-buffered saline, DDA/TDB alone and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) controls (P<0.05).

Hyaluronidases from animal venoms cleave hyaluronan present in the extracellular matrix, acting as spreading factors of toxins into the tissues of the victim. However, the in-depth characterization of hyaluronidase from animal venoms has been neglected due to its instability and low concentration in the venom, which hamper its isolation. Thus, heterologous expression of hyaluronidase acts as a biotechnological tool in the obtainment of enough amounts of the enzyme for structural and functional studies. Therefore, this study produced a recombinant hyaluronidase from Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, designated as rTsHyal-1, in the Pichia pastoris system. Thus, a gene for TsHyal-1 (gb|KF623285.1) was synthesized and cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector (GenScript Corporation) for heterologous expression in P. pastoris. rTsHyal-1 was expressed in laboratorial scale in a buffered minimal medium containing methanol (BMM) for 96 h with daily addition of methanol. Expression of rTsHyal-1 resulted in a total protein yield of 0.266 mg/mL. rTsHyal-1 partially purified through cation exchange chromatography presented a specific activity of 1097 TRU/mg, against 838 TRU/mg for the final expressed material, representing a 1.31-fold purification. rTsHyal-1 has molecular mass of 49.5 kDa, and treatment with PNGase F and analysis by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) indicated a potential N-glycosylation of 4.5 kDa. Additionally, de novo sequencing of rTsHyal-1, performed in MALDI-TOF and Q Exactive Orbitrap MS, resulted in 46.8% of protein sequence coverage. rTsHyal-1 presents the highest substrate specificity to hyaluronan followed by chondroitin-6-sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate and showed an optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C. These results validate the biotechnological process for the heterologous expression of rTsHyal-1.

The protein, purified to homogeneity by chromatographic techniques, was obtained at a 42% yield. The following biochemical characteristics were determined: the enzyme had an optimal pH of 3, was stable for at least 3hat 55 degrees C, and was inhibited in catalytic activity almost completely by Hg(+2). The respective Km and Vmax for the recombinant inulinase with inulin as substrate were 1.35mM and 2673mumol/min/mg. The recombinant enzyme is an exoinulinase but also possesses synthetic activity (i. e., fructosyl transferase). The high level of production of this recombinant plus its relevant biochemical properties would argue that the process presented here is a possible recourse for industrial applications in carbohydrate processing.</p></details></div>

Here, we used a new combined strategy to overexpress ROL in Pichia pastoris. An efficient method based on bio-brick was developed to construct a series of vectors harboring different copy numbers of ROL gene cassettes, which were then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 to generate a strain with specific copy numbers of ROL. An optimized gene-dosage recombinant strain of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# harboring five copies of ROL was screened, revealing production of the highest activity (2700 U/mL), which was 8-fold higher than that of the strain harboring one copy. The activity of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# was then enhanced to 3080 U/mL in a shaking flask under optimized culture conditions. Subsequently, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein-degradation-related genes Ubc1 or/and Hrd1 were co-expressed with ROL to further increase ROL expression. The activities of the recombinant strains, GS115/5ROL-Ubc1 22#, -Hrd1 15#, and -Hrd1-Ubc1 1#, were 4000 U/mL, 4200 U/mL, and 4750 U/mL, which was 29.9%, 36.4%, and 54.2% higher, respectively, than that observed in GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11#. Using the combined strategy, ROL expression was improved 15.8-fold, with maximum GS115/5ROL-Hrd1-Ubc1 1# activity reaching 33,900 U/mL via a sorbitol/methanol co-feeding strategy in a 3-L fermenter and resulting in a 1.65-, 1.26-, and 1.14-fold enhancement relative to the activities observed in strains GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11#, GS115/5ROL-Ubc1 22#, and GS115/5ROL-Hrd1 15#, respectively. These results indicated that heterologous overexpression of ROL in P. pastoris using this combined strategy is feasible for large-scale industrialization.</p></details></div>

Optically pure 2,3-BD is a crucial precursor for the chiral synthesis and it can also be used as anti-freeze agent due to its low freezing point. 2,3-BD has been produced in both native and non-native hosts. Several pathogenic bacteria were reported to produce 2,3-BD in mixture of its optical isomers including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Engineered hosts based on episomal plasmid expression such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis are not ideal for industrial fermentation due to plasmid instability. Results: Pichia pastoris is generally regarded as safe and a well-established host for high-level heterologous protein production. To produce pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD enantiomer, we developed a P. pastoris strain by introducing a synthetic pathway. The alsS and alsD genes from B. subtilis were codon-optimized and synthesized. The BDH1 gene from S. cerevisiae was cloned. These three pathway genes were integrated into the genome of P. pastoris and expressed under the control of GAP promoter. Production of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was achieved using glucose as feedstock. The optical purity of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was more than 99%. The titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD reached 12 g/L with 40 g/L glucose as carbon source in shake flask fermentation. The fermentation conditions including pH, agitation speeds and aeration rates were optimized in batch cultivations. The highest titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD achieved in fed-batch fermentation using YPD media was 45 g/L. The titer of 2,3-BD was enhanced to 74.5 g/L through statistical medium optimization. Conclusions: The potential of engineering P. pastoris into a microbial cell factory for biofuel production was evaluated in this work using (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD as an example. Engineered P. pastoris could be a promising workhorse for the production of optically pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD.</p></details></div>

Spt23 is responsible for regulation of Delta-9 desaturase expression in Pichia pastoris. Disruption of SPT23 leads to a remarkable decrease in cellular unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, we found that deletion of SPT23 resulted in growth defects under high temperature culture conditions and heat treatment induced the expression of SPT23. By measuring expression changes of heat shock proteins, protein levels and cellular localization of Hsf1, it was revealed that the sensitivity of spt23Delta to high temperature was independent of the heat shock response. Addition of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol can restore the growth defects of spt23Delta under heat conditions. In addition, loss of SPT23 led to increased plasma membrane permeability, decreased plasma membrane integrity, depolarization, ergosterol synthesis defects and cell wall component disorder, which suggested that the sensitivity to heat treatment in spt23Delta was due to plasma membrane damage. Taken together, our results give new insights into the relationship between Spt23 and high temperature environmental stress.</p></details></div>

However, the low performance in extreme conditions seriously challenges the enzyme's commercial utilization. To obtain endoglucanases with substantially improved activity and thermostability, structure-based rational design was carried out based on the Chaetomium thermophilum beta-1,4-endoglucanase CTendo45. In this study, five mutant enzymes were constructed by substitution of conserved and noncatalytic residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants were constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and ultimately tested for enzymatic characteristics. Two single mutants, Y30F and Y173F, increased the enzyme's specific activity 1.35- and 1.87-fold using carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) as a substrate, respectively. Furthermore, CTendo45 and mutants exhibited higher activity towards beta-D-glucan than that of CMC-Na, and activities of Y173F and Y30F were also increased obviously against beta-D-glucan. In addition, Y173F significantly improved the enzyme's heat resistance at 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C. More interestingly, the double mutant Y30F/Y173F obtained considerably higher stability at elevated temperatures but failed to inherit the increased catalytic efficiency of its single mutant counterparts. This work gives an initial insight into the biological function of conserved and noncatalytic residues of thermostable endoglucanases and proposes a feasible path for the improvement of enzyme redesign proposals.</p></details></div>

Due to their outstanding ability of specifically hydroxylating complex hydrocarbons, there is a great demand to use these enzymes for biocatalysis, including applications at an industrial scale. Thus, the recombinant production of these enzymes is intensively investigated. However, especially eukaryotic P450s are difficult to produce. Challenges are faced due to complex cofactor requirements and the availability of a redox-partner (cytochrome P450 reductase, CPR) can be a key element to get active P450s. Additionally, most eukaryotic P450s are membrane bound which complicates the recombinant production.

Neutron scattering, and in particular neutron diffraction can provide unique and detailed information on the structure of lipid membranes. However, deuterated samples are desirable to fully exploit this powerful method. Recently, the extraction of lipids from microorganisms grown in deuterated media was demonstrated to be both an attracting route to obtain complex lipid mixtures resembling the composition of natural membranes, and to producing deuterated molecules in a very convenient way. A full characterization of these deuterated extracts is hence pivotal for their use in building up model membrane systems. Here we report the structural characterization of lipid extracts obtained from Pichia pastoris by means of neutron diffraction measurements. In particular, we compare the structure of membranes extracted from yeast cells grown in a standard culture medium and in a corresponding deuterated culture medium. The results show that the different molecular composition of the deuterated and protiated lipid extracts induce different structural organization of the lipid membranes. In addition, we compare these membranes composed of extracted yeast lipids with stacked bilayers prepared from synthetic lipid mixtures.</p></details></div>

Therefore, initiating methanol induction at lower cell concentration is considered as an alternative strategy to overcome those problems. However, the methanol/energy regulation mechanisms of initiating induction at lower concentration are not clear and seldom reported. In this article, with monellin production as a prototype, we analyzed the methanol/energy metabolism in protein expression process using the strategies of initiating induction at both higher/lower cells concentrations. We attempted to interpret the advantages of the "alternative" strategy, via online measurements of methanol consumption, CO(2) production and O(2) uptake rates. When adopting this "alternative" strategy and maintaining temperature at 30 degrees C, carbon flux ratio directing into monellin precursors synthesis reached the highest level of 65%.

EcCDA1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the gills. The expression of EcCDA1 in the prawns challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila changed in a time-dependent manner. The expression of EcCDA1 in the prawns challenged with V. parahaemolyticus was up-regulated at 12h (p<0.05), and significantly up-regulated at 24h and 48h (p<0.01), and then returned to the control levels at 96h post-challenge (p>0.05).

Due to many advantages of Pichia pastoris expression systems for producing industrial enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins, in this study P. pastoris was chosen as a host for KGF expression. For preparing human KGF coding sequence, MCF-7 cell line was treated with 1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 for inducing the expression of KGF. The coding sequence of 23N-terminal truncated KGF form was amplified using RT-PCR technique and then cloned into the yeast expression vector in frame with the yeast alpha-factor secretion signal. The recombinant plasmid was integrated into Pichia pastoris strain X-33 genome. Western blotting and Mass Spectrometry demonstrated that recombinant human KGF (rhKGF) was correctly expressed after methanol induction and secreted into the media. The recombinant protein was purified from the media by heparin affinity chromatography. MTT assay showed that the purified rhKGF had a proliferative effect on NIH3T3 and A549 cell lines.

As of today, a gene sequence coding for kievitone hydratase activity has only been identified and characterized in Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli. Here, we report on the identification of a putative kievitone hydratase sequence in Nectria haematococca (NhKHS), the teleomorph state of F. solani, based on in silico sequence analyses. After heterologous expression of the enzyme in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, we have confirmed its kievitone hydration activity and have assessed its biochemical properties and substrate specificity. Purified recombinant NhKHS is obviously a homodimeric glycoprotein. Due to its good activity for the readily available chalcone derivative xanthohumol (XN), this compound was selected as a model substrate for biochemical studies. The optimal pH and temperature for hydratase activity were 6.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively, and apparent Vmax and Km values for hydration of XN were 7.16 mumol min-1 mg-1 and 0.98 +/- 0.13 mM, respectively.

However, the only available yeast-derived rhIL-11 presents an obstacle in low production yield, as well as an unamiable process, such as the use of reverse-phase chromatography employing plenty of toxic organic solvents. Our findings showed that the low yield was due to self-aggregation of rhIL-11. A novel process recovering bioactive rhIL-11 from the yeast secretory medium therefore has been developed and demonstrated, involving fermentation from Pichia pastoris, followed by a two-phase extraction to precipitate rhIL-11. After renaturing, the protein of interest was purified by a two-column step, comprising a cation-exchanger, and a hydrophobic interaction chromatography in tandem at high sample loads that was facile and cost-effective in future scale-up. Identity and quality assessments confirmed the expected amino acid sequence without N-terminal heterogeneity, as well as high quality in potency and purity. Such a process provides an alternative and adequate supply of the starting material for the PEGylated rhIL-11.</p></details></div>

In brief, one mutant, named ATX11A(41), possessing the lowest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value was designed based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by substituting the N-terminal 41 amino acids of AoXyn11A with the corresponding 42 ones of pXYL11, a thermophilic GHF11 xylanase from Thermobifida fusca. On the basis of the primary structure alignment of pXYL11 with ATX11A(41) (or AoXyn11A), another mutant, named ATX11A(41/cord), was designed by substituting the cord region ((93)GTYNPGSGG(101)) of ATX11A(41) with the corresponding one ((93)GTYRPTG(99)) of pXYL11. Both mutant-encoding genes, ATx11A(41) and ATx11A(41/cord), were constructed as designed theoretically by a megaprimer PCR technique and were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The specific activities of recombinant (re) AoXyn11A, ATX11A(41), and ATX11A(41/cord) were 2916.7, 2667.6, and 2457.0 U/mg, respectively. The analysis of temperature characteristics displayed that the temperature optimum (Topt) of reATX11A(41) or reATX11A(41/cord) was 65 degrees C, which was 15 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11A. The thermal inactivation half-life (t1/2) values of reATX11A(41) and reATX11A(41/cord) at 60 degrees C were 55 and 83 min, respectively, whereas that of reAoXyn11A was only 18 min at 50 degrees C. The melting temperature (Tm) values of reAoXyn11A, reATX11A(41), and reATX11A(41/cord) were 54.2, 66.7, and 71.9 degrees C, respectively.

ABCD13 are located on peroxisomal membrane and play an important role in the transportation of various fatty acid-CoA derivatives, including very long chain fatty acid-CoA, into peroxisomes. ABCD4 is located on lysosomal membrane and is suggested to be involved in the transport of vitamin B12 from lysosomes to the cytosol. However, the precise transport mechanism by which these ABC transporters facilitate the import or export of substrate has yet to be well elucidated. In this study, the overexpression of human ABCD14 in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and a purification procedure were developed. The detergent-solubilized proteins were reconstituted into liposomes. ABCD14 displayed stable ATPase activity, which was inhibited by AlF3. Furthermore, ABCD14 were found to possess an equal levels of acyl-CoA thioesterase activity.

An effective vaccine should be able to prevent both, the horizontal and vertical transmission of N. caninum. In this study, the immune vaccinal response of the recombinant protein rNcSRS2 of N. caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris and formulated with water-in-oil emulsion, xanthan gum, and alum hydroxide was assessed in an experimental murine model. Groups of 10 Balb/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated with two doses of prNcSRS2 twenty-one days apart. After the second immunization, four mice from each group were euthanized, and splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo with recombinant protein. The IgG dynamics were evaluated by indirect ELISA, and the splenocytes cytokines transcription by qPCR. All groups elicited specific antibodies against prNcSRS2, with the water-in-oil group showing significantly (p</=.05) elevated titers compared to the other groups. The prNcSRS2 protein alone did not induce a significant ex vivo splenic transcription level of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 cytokines, except for IL-17A, and the adjuvant associations with the prNcSRS2 protein induced different cytokine transcription profiles. The water-in-oil emulsion modulated the expression of TNF-alpha; the xanthan gum modulated IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12; and alum hydroxide modulated IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12. In conclusion, it was found that the association of the recombinant prNcSRS2 protein with different adjuvants induced different levels of specific antibody, and a distinct splenic cytokine profile in an adjuvant-dependent manner. The mechanisms of adjuvancity activity is complex, so adjuvant formulation may help in the design of efficient vaccine to control Neosporosis.</p></details></div>

In this work, the individual reactions of terreic acid biosynthesis were determined by stepwise pathway assembly in a heterologous host, Pichia pastoris, on the basis of previous knockout studies in a native host, Aspergillus terreus. Polyketide synthase AtX was found to catalyze the formation of partially reduced polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid, followed by 3-methylcatechol synthesis by salicylate 1-monooxygenase AtA-mediated decarboxylative hydroxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid. Our results show that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase AtE hydroxylates 3-methylcatechol, thus producing the next product, 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol. A smaller putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, AtG, assists with this step. Then, AtD causes epoxidation and hydroxyl oxidation of 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol and produces a compound terremutin, via which the previously unknown function of AtD was identified as cyclooxygenation. The final step involves an oxidation reaction of a hydroxyl group by a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase, AtC, which leads to the final product: terreic acid. Functions of AtD and AtG were determined for the first time. All the genes were reanalyzed and all intermediates and final products were isolated and identified. Our model fully defines the molecular steps and corrects previous results from the literature.</p></details></div>

As recombinant CCII (rCCII) might avoid potential pathogenic virus contamination during nCCII preparation or chromosomal integration and oncogene activation associated with DNA vaccines, here we evaluated the importance of propeptide and telopeptide domains on rCCII triple helix molecular assembly. We constructed pC- and pN-procollagen (without N- or Cpropeptides, respectively) as well as CTEs located in the triple helical domain lacking both propeptides and telopeptides, and expressed these in yeast Pichia pastoris host strain GS115 (his4, Mut(+)) simultaneously with recombinant chicken prolyl-4-hydroxylase alpha and beta subunits. Both pC- and pN-procollagen monomers accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, whereas CTE was assembled into homotrimers with stable conformation and secreted into the supernatants, suggesting that the large molecular weight pC-or pN-procollagens were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the smaller CTEs proceeded through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, resulting recombinant chicken type II collagen pCalpha1(II) can induced collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, which seems to be as effective as the current standard nCCII. Notably, protease digestion assays showed that rCCII could assemble in the absence of C- and N-propeptides or telopeptides. These findings provide new insights into the minimal structural requirements for rCCII expression and folding.</p></details></div>

Sl-PME and Sl-EPG were overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and enzymatically characterized. Sl-EPG presents optimal activity at pH4-5 and 50 degrees C, showing that it can be used for juice extraction and clarification. On the other hand, Sl-PME presents optimal activity at pH6-8 and 40 degrees C, and thus, suitable for both acidic and alkaline processing, such as coffee and tea fermentation. Sl-EPG shows Vmax=3.23mM/min, KM=2.4g/L and kcat=418.6s(-1). While Sl-PME shows Vmax=0.14mM/min, KM=4.1g/L and kcat=1.7s(-1). A PG inhibitor (PGIP2) weakly interfered in the Sl-EPG activity and Sl-PME was not affected by a usual PME inhibitor.

Antibodies to any one DENV serotype which can protect against homotypic re-infection, do not offer heterotypic cross-protection. In fact, cross-reactive antibodies may augment heterotypic DENV infection through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). A recently launched live attenuated vaccine (LAV) for dengue, which consists of a mixture of four chimeric yellow-fever/dengue vaccine viruses, may be linked to the induction of disease-enhancing antibodies. This is likely related to viral interference among the replicating viral strains, resulting in an unbalanced immune response, as well as to the fact that the LAV encodes prM, a DENV protein documented to elicit ADE-mediating antibodies. This makes it imperative to explore the feasibility of alternate ADE risk-free vaccine candidates. Our quest for a non-replicating vaccine centered on the DENV envelope (E) protein which mediates virus entry into the host cell and serves as an important target of the immune response. Serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes and the host receptor recognition function map to E domain III (EDIII). Recently, we found that Pichia pastoris-expressed DENV E protein, of all four serotypes, self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of prM. Significantly, these VLPs displayed EDIII and elicited EDIII-focused DENV-neutralizing antibodies in mice. We now report the creation and characterization of a novel non-replicating recombinant particulate vaccine candidate, produced by co-expressing the E proteins of DENV-1 and DENV-2 in P. pastoris. The two E proteins co-assembled into bivalent mosaic VLPs (mVLPs) designated as mE1E2bv VLPs. The mVLP, which preserved the serotype-specific antigenic integrity of its two component proteins, elicited predominantly EDIII-focused homotypic virus-neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice, demonstrating its efficacy. In an in vivo ADE model, mE1E2bv VLP-induced antibodies lacked discernible ADE potential, compared to the cross-reactive monoclonal antibody 4G2, as evidenced by significant reduction in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, suggesting inherent safety. The results obtained with these bivalent mVLPs suggest the feasibility of incorporating the E proteins of DENV-3 and DENV-4 to create a tetravalent mVLP vaccine.</p></details></div>

We expressed in Pichia pastoris two chimeric proteins by merging the three central repeat regions of different CSP alleles (VK210, VK247, and P. vivax-like). The first construct (yPvCSP-AllFL) contained the fused repeat regions flanked by N- and C-terminal regions. The second construct (yPvCSP-AllCT) contained the fused repeat regions and the C-terminal domain, plus RI region. Mice were vaccinated with three doses of yPvCSP in adjuvants Poly (</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C) or Montanide ISA720.

Regardless of the regime used, immunized mice generated high IgG titres specific to all CSP alleles. After challenge with P. berghei ANKA transgenic parasites expressing Pb/PvVK210 or Pb/PvVK247 sporozoites, significant time delays for parasitemia were observed in all vaccinated mice. These vaccine formulations should be clinically tried for their potential as protective universal vaccine against P. vivax malaria.</p></details></div>

We used RACE PCR to isolate novel enzymes from Galium verum with the ability to clot milk. This approach generated two cDNA sequences (named preprogaline A and B) encoding proteins displaying the typical plant aspartic protease primary structure. Preprogaline B was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, after deleting and replacing its original signal peptide with the yeast alpha-factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The secreted recombinant protein was obtained by growing P. pastoris in YPD medium and had the ability to clot milk. The mature form of progaline B is a heterodimeric glycosylated enzyme, with a molecular weight of approximately 48kDa, that contains a heavy (30.7kDa) and a light (13.5kDa) polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. Western blot analysis revealed that progaline B is activated by the acidification of the yeast culture medium and that enzymatic activation requires two steps. First the precursor protein is cleaved into two polypeptide chains by partial removal of the plant-specific insert (PSI) present in plant aspartic proteases; this is later followed by propeptide removal. By altering the pH of the P. pastoris culture medium, we were able to obtain either active or inactive forms of the enzyme. Recombinant progaline B displayed a kappa-casein hydrolysis pattern analogous to those produced by the animal and microbial coagulants currently used in the dairy industry, but it exhibited a different digestion profile on alpha- and beta-caseins. The plant protease progaline B displays milk-clotting activities suitable for the production of novel dairy products.</p></details></div>

Komagataella phaffii) is one of the most common eukaryotic expression systems for heterologous protein production. Expression cassettes are typically integrated in the genome to obtain stable expression strains. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where short overhangs are sufficient to target highly specific integration, long overhangs are more efficient in P. pastoris and ectopic integration of foreign DNA can occur. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of ectopic integration by high-throughput screening of >700 transformants and whole-genome sequencing of 27 transformants. Different vector designs and linearization approaches were used to mimic the most common integration events targeted in P. pastoris Fluorescence of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter protein was highly uniform among transformants when the expression cassettes were correctly integrated in the targeted locus. Surprisingly, most nonspecifically integrated transformants showed highly uniform expression that was comparable to specific integration, suggesting that nonspecific integration does not necessarily influence expression. However, a few clones (<10%) harboring ectopically integrated cassettes showed a greater variation spanning a 25-fold range, surpassing specifically integrated reference strains up to 6-fold. High-expression strains showed a correlation between increased gene copy numbers and high reporter protein fluorescence levels. Our results suggest that for comparing expression levels between strains, the integration locus can be neglected as long as a sufficient numbers of transformed strains are compared. For expression optimization of highly expressible proteins, increasing copy number appears to be the dominant positive influence rather than the integration locus, genomic rearrangements, deletions, or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).IMPORTANCE Yeasts are commonly used as biotechnological production hosts for proteins and metabolites. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression cassettes carrying foreign genes integrate highly specifically at the targeted sites in the genome. In contrast, cassettes often integrate at random genomic positions in nonconventional yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). Hence, cells from the same transformation event often behave differently, with significant clonal variation necessitating the screening of large numbers of strains. The importance of this study is that we systematically investigated the influence of integration events in more than 700 strains. Our findings provide novel insight into clonal variation in P. pastoris and, thus, how to avoid pitfalls and obtain reliable results. The underlying mechanisms may also play a role in other yeasts and hence could be generally relevant for recombinant yeast protein production strains.</p></details></div>

This revelation has stimulated research aimed at developing sustainable and green cutinase-catalyzed PET recycling methods. Leaf and branch compost cutinase (LCC) is particularly suited toward these ends given its relatively high PET hydrolysis activity and thermostability. Any practical enzymatic PET recycling application will require that the protein have kinetic stability at or above the PET glass transition temperature (Tg, i.e., 70 degrees C). This paper elucidates the thermodynamics and kinetics of LCC conformational and colloidal stability. Aggregation emerged as a major contributor that reduces LCC kinetic stability. In its native state, LCC is prone to aggregation owing to electrostatic interactions. Further, with increasing temperature, perturbation of LCC's tertiary structure and corresponding exposure of hydrophobic domains leads to rapid aggregation. Glycosylation was employed in an attempt to impede LCC aggregation. Owing to the presence of three putative N-glycosylation sites, expression of native LCC in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production of glycosylated LCC (LCC-G). LCC-G showed improved stability to native state aggregation while increasing the temperature for thermal induced aggregation by 10 degrees C. Furthermore, stabilization against thermal aggregation resulted in improved catalytic PET hydrolysis both at its optimum temperature and concentration.</p></details></div>

However, no vaccine is currently available to prevent EV-D68 infection. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of developing a virus-like particle (VLP)-based EV-D68 vaccine. We found that co-expression of the P1 precursor and 3CD protease of EV-D68 in Pichia pastoris yeast resulted in the generation of EV-D68 VLPs, which were composed of processed VP0, VP1, and VP3 capsid proteins and were visualized as ~30 nm spherical particles. Mice immunized with these VLPs produced serum antibodies capable of specifically neutralizing EV-D68 infections in vitro. The in vivo protective efficacy of the EV-D68 VLP candidate vaccine was assessed in two challenge experiments. The first challenge experiment showed that neonatal mice born to the VLP-immunized dams were fully protected from lethal EV-D68 infection, whereas in the second experiment, passive transfer of anti-VLP sera was found to confer complete protection in the recipient mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate the proof-of-concept for VLP-based broadly effective EV-D68 vaccines.</p></details></div>

In this study, we demonstrate that the mAb trastuzumab expressed in glycoengineered P. pastoris can be remodeled through deglycosylation by endoglycosidases identified from the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database and through transglycosylation using glycans with a stable leaving group to generate a homogeneous antibody designed to optimize the effector functions. The 10 newly identified recombinant bacterial endoglycosidases are complementary to existing endoglycosidases (EndoA, EndoH, EndoS), two of which can even accept sialylated tri- and tetraantennary glycans as substrates.</p></details></div>

In this study, expressions of the immune-related genes in the midgut of P. xylostella orally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris were profiled by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR approaches. The results revealed that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways and possibly the prophenoloxidase activation system in P. xylostella could be activated by oral infections, and moricins, gloverins and lysozyme2 might act as important effectors against microorganisms. Subsequent knock-down of IMD showed that this gene was involved in regulating the expression of down-stream genes in the IMD pathway.

Biochemical characterization experiments demonstrated that both RsMan26A and RsMan26B are endo-acting enzymes and have a very similar substrate specificity, displaying a higher catalytic efficiency to galactomannan from locust bean gum (LBG) and glucomannan than to beta-1,4-mannan and highly substituted galactomannan from guar gum. Homology modeling of RsMan26A and RsMan26B revealed that each enzyme displays a long open cleft harboring a unique hydrophobic platform (Trp(79)) that stacks against the sugar ring at subsite - 5. The Km values of W79A mutants of RsMan26A and RsMan26B to LBG increased by 4.8-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively, compared with those for the native enzymes, while the kcat remained unchanged or about 40% of that of the native enzyme, resulting in the decrease in the catalytic efficiency by 4.8-fold and 9.1-fold, respectively. The kinetic values for glucomannan also showed a similar result.

Acquiring control over the natural regulation of promoters is important for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications. In the commonly used protein production host Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris), methanol-inducible promoters are used because of their tight regulation and exceptional strength. Yet, induction with toxic and flammable methanol can be a considerable safety risk and cannot be applied in many existing fermentation plants. Here we studied new regulatory circuits based on the most frequently used alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1 ), which is tightly repressed in presence of repressing carbon sources and strongly induced by methanol. We compared different overexpression strategies for putative carbon source dependent regulators identified by a homology search in related yeasts and previously published literature in order to convert existing methanol dependent expression strains into methanol free systems. While constitutive overexpression showed only marginal or detrimental effects, derepressed expression (activated when the repressing carbon source is depleted) showed that three transcription factors (TFs) are single handedly suitable to strongly activate PAOX1 in P. pastoris without relying on any specifically engineered host strains. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that Mxr1, Mit1, and Prm1 regulate partly overlapping and unique sets of genes. Derepressed overexpression of a single TF was sufficient to retrofit existing PAOX1 based expression strains into glucose/glycerol regulated, methanol-free systems. Given the wide applicability of carbon source regulated promoters, the simplicity and low cost of controlling carbon source feed rates in large scale bioreactors, similar approaches as in P. pastoris may also be useful in other organisms.</p></details></div>

Two novel promoters were successfully identified and could possibly be applied in recombinant protein expression: the methanol-inducible promoter P0547 and the constitutive promoter P0472 .</p></details></div>

A marked improvement in rBhCA production was achieved by developing a P. pastoris recombinant that produces rBhCA constitutively as compared to that under inducible promoter. The purified rBhCA from P. pastoris is a glycosylated protein that displays a higher molecular mass (79.5 kDa) than that produced from E. coli recombinant (75 kDa); the former has a Tm of 75 degrees C, which is slightly higher than that of the latter (72 degrees C). The former rBhCA exhibits higher thermostability than the latter. The former sequestered CO2 efficiently similar to that of the native BhCA and the latter. This is the first report on the production of recombinant carbonic anhydrase extracellularly in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

The selectivity of autophagy is determined by autophagy receptors, such as Pichia pastoris Atg30 (autophagy-related 30), which controls the selective degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) through the assembly of a receptor-protein complex (RPC). Previously, we proved that the peroxisomal acyl-CoA-binding protein, Atg37, and the highly conserved peroxin, Pex3, are required for RPC formation and efficient pexophagy. Here, we describe how Atg37 and Pex3 regulate the assembly and activation of the pexophagic RPC. We demonstrate that Atg30 requires both Atg37 and Pex3 to recruit Atg8 and Atg11 to the pexophagic RPC, because Atg37 depends on Pex3 for its localization at the peroxisomal membrane. We establish that due to close proximity of Atg37- and Pex3-binding sites in the middle domain of Atg30, the binding of these proteins to Atg30 is mutually exclusive within this region. We also show that direct binding of Pex3 and Atg37 to Atg30 regulates its phosphorylation by the Hrr25 kinase, negatively and positively, respectively. Based on these results we present a model that clarifies the assembly and activation of the pexophagic RPC through the phosphoregulation of Atg30.</p></details></div>

The increase of the transgene dosage from one to nine copies enhanced 7.9-fold the recombinant enzyme (Sa1-SSTrec) yield without causing cell toxicity. Secretion driven by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor signal peptide resulted in periplasmic retention (38%) and extracellular release (62%) of Sa1-SSTrec to an overall activity of 102.1U/ml when biomass reached (106g/l, dry weight) in fed-batch fermentation using cane sugar for cell growth. The volumetric productivity of the nine-copy clone PGFT6x-308 at the end of fermentation (72h) was 1422.2U/l/h. Sa1-SSTrec purified from the culture supernatant was a monomeric glycoprotein optimally active at pH 5.0-6.0 and 45-50 degrees C. The removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by Endo Hf treatment decreased the enzyme stability but had no effect on the substrate and product specificities. Sa1-SSTrec converted sucrose (600g/l) into 1-kestose (GF2) and nystose (GF3) in a ratio 9:1 with their sum representing 55-60% (w/w) of the total carbohydrates in the reaction mixture. Variations in the sucrose (100-800g/l) or enzyme (1.5-15 units per gram of substrate) concentrations kept unaltered the product profile. Sa1-SSTrec is an attractive candidate enzyme for the industrial production of short-chain fructooligosaccharides, most particularly 1-kestose.</p></details></div>

Recently, a unique secretory lipase from the human pathogen Leishmania donovani Ldlip3 has been identified and characterized. This lipase has a high identity with a putative triacylglycerol lipase of Leishmania major (Lmlip2). In the present study, Lmlip2 was expressed in the eukaryotic heterologous expression system Pichia pastoris as tagged enzyme of 308 amino acids. Maximal protein production was reached after 2 days of fermentation. Optimal Lmlip2 lipase activity was measured using the pH stat technique at pH 8at 26 degrees C using vinyl esters and triacylglycerols (true lipids) as substrates. Moreover, biochemical characterization of Lmlip2 contained in culture supernatant, illustrates that L. major secreted lipase is active and stable at low temperatures especially 26 degrees and prefer neutral pH; concerning substrate specificityLmlip2 presents a preference for short chains lipid substrates vinyl esters such as VC2, VC3 and VC4 likewise, it is capable to hydrolyze long chain triacylglycerols like olive oil. Metal ions and surfactants tested in this study decrease Lmlip2 activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the relation between the lipase activity and the virulence. Thus, it could lead to the identification of novel targets to block cutaneous Leishmaniasis in human hosts.</p></details></div>

For this purpose, first, iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared by co-precipitation method in alkali media and coated with silica. Then the surface was activated by amine groups and conjugated with oxidized antibodies. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) were used to study the physical properties of MNPs. To evaluate the efficacy of these MNPs as a purification technique successfully synthesized MNPs were added to the rHBsAg sample to couple with the antigen and then be isolated based on their magnetic property.

The CbGH5 protein was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. It is the first bifunctional cellulase-xylanase reported in GH5_46 as well as in Chryseobacterium genus. The enzyme showed an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose of 3237 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 9, 90 degrees C and a xylanase activity on birchwood xylan of 1793 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 8, 90 degrees C. The activity level and thermophilicity are in the front rank of all the known cellulases and xylanases. Core hydrophobicity had a positive effect on the thermophilicity of this enzyme. When similar quantity of enzymatic activity units was applied on the straws of wheat, rice, corn and oilseed rape, CbGH5 could obtain 3.5-5.0x glucose and 1.2-1.8x xylose than a mixed commercial cellulase plus xylanase of Novozymes.

We expressed two different human globin types in these three expression systems: I) the well-characterized neuroglobin and II) the uncharacterized, circular permutated globin domain of the large chimeric globin androglobin. It is clear from the literature that E.coli is the most used expression system for expression and purification of recombinant globins.

It is activated by various stresses, including hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, high-temperature stress and exposure to arsenite. Hog1, the crucial MAP kinase of the pathway, localizes to the nucleus in response to high osmotic concentrations, i.e. high osmolarity; but, otherwise, little is known about its intracellular dynamics and regulation. By using the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii, we found that CbHog1-Venus formed intracellular dot structures after high-temperature stress in a reversible manner. Microscopic observation revealed that CbHog1-mCherry colocalized with CbPab1-Venus, a marker protein of stress granules. Hog1 homologs in Pichia pastoris and Schizosaccharomyces pombe also exhibited similar dot formation under high-temperature stress, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hog1 (ScHog1)-GFP did not. Analysis of CbHog1-Venus in C. boidinii revealed that a beta-sheet structure in the N-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for its localization to stress granules. Physiological studies revealed that sequestration of activated Hog1 proteins in stress granules was responsible for downregulation of Hog1 activity under high-temperature stress.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.</p></details></div>

A limited number of FAEs have been functionally characterized compared to over 1000 putative fungal FAEs that were recently predicted by similarity-based genome mining, which divided phylogenetically into different subfamilies (SFs). In this study, 27 putative and six characterized FAEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were selected and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant proteins biochemically characterized to validate the previous genome mining and phylogenetical grouping and to expand the information on activity of fungal FAEs.

As important prerequisite for T-cell activation, all yeasts were shown to effectively induce, though to a different extent, the expression of the activation marker CD83, the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, CD54, CD58, and CD40, as well as the antigen-presenting molecules MHCs I and II. Furthermore, yeast-activated DC secreted various cytokines including inflammatory TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta or T-cell polarizing IL-12, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-27. Variability was observed in the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in response to the tested yeasts, whereas expression levels of IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 were similar. Interestingly, maturation marker expression and cytokine secretion were not negatively affected after application of yeast mutants with altered cell wall mannoprotein structure (Deltamnn11) or defective in protein N-glycosylation (Deltaost3), indicating that elongated cell wall mannoproteins at the outer yeast cell surface are not a prerequisite for the observed yeast-mediated DC maturation.

In this study, six different NK-lysin genes (nkl1, nkl2, nkl3, nkl4, nkl5 and nkl6) were identified in the common carp genome. Each of the mature peptides of common carp NK-lysin has six well-conserved cysteine residues, and shares a Saposin B domain, characteristic of saposin-like protein (SALIP) family. The gene nkl1 contains 5 extrons and 4 introns, and nkl2, nkl3, nkl4 or nkl5 contains 4 extrons and 3 introns, however, the nkl6 has 3 extrons and 2 introns. By quantitative real-time PCR, nkl2 transcripts were predominantly expressed in spleen of healthy common carp, while elevated mainly in gill and spleen upon Aeromonas hydrophila infection. The recombinant NK-lysin-2 purified from Pichia pastoris shows antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli M15, Aeromonas hydrophila, as well as Edwardsiella tarda (Gram-negative), the latter two are important pathogens of aquaculture.

Fructan can also be hydrolyzed by plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), but these enzymes have not been used to produce fructose commercially. Two Ht1-FEHs (Ht1-FEH I and Ht1-FEH II) were recently characterized in Jerusalem artichoke. In this study, we cloned the third member of the Ht1-FEH family in Jerusalem artichoke (i.e., Ht1-FEH III). When heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33, Ht1-FEH III not only demonstrated hydrolysis activity towards beta (2, 1)-linked fructans and beta (2, 6)-linked levan, but also towards sucrose. To explore the potential industrial applications, we heterologously expressed and purified six plant 1-FEHs from two typical fructan plants (i.e., chicory and Jerusalem artichoke) and showed that chicory Ci1-FEH IIa had the highest hydrolysis capacity to fructan in vitro. Furthermore, we immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa on resin and optimized the immobilization conditions. We found that inulin-type fructan or the tuber extract from Jerusalem artichoke could be rapidly degraded into fructose and sucrose by immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa. The capacity of Ci1-FEH IIa to release fructose from fructans was comparable to that of some inulinases from microorganisms. Thus, plant FEHs have potential applications in fructose production.</p></details></div>

The ChPLA2-V cDNA was synthesized from chicken heart polyA mRNA by RT-PCR, and an expression construct containing the PLA2 was established. After expression in Pichia pastoris cells, the active enzyme was purified. The purified ChPLA2-V protein was biochemically and physiologically characterized. The recombinant ChPLA2-V has an absolute requirement for Ca(2+) for enzymatic activity. The optimum pH for this enzyme is pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer with phosphatidylcholine as substrate. ChPLA2-V was found to display potent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bactericidal activity and antifungal activity in vitro. The purified enzyme ChPLA2-V with much stronger anticoagulant activity compared with the intestinal and pancreatic chicken PLA2-V was approximately 10 times more active.

Here a systematic replacement studies of the core promoter and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the exceptionally strong and tightly methanol regulated Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter at unprecedented resolution is performed. Adjacent triplets of the 200 bp long core promoter are mutated at a time by changing the wild-type sequence into cytosine or adenine triplets, resulting in 130 variants that are cloned upstream of an eGFP reporter gene providing a library for expression fine-tuning. Mutations in the TATA box motif, regions downstream of the transcription start site or next to the start codon in the 5'UTR had a significant effect on the eGFP fluorescence. Surprisingly, mutations in most other regions are tolerated, indicating that yeast core promoters can show a high tolerance toward small mutations, supporting regulatory models of degenerate motifs, or redundant design. The authors exploited these neutral core promoter positions, not affecting expression, to introduce extrinsic sequence elements such as cloning sites (allowing targeted core promoter/5'UTR modifications) and bacterial promoters (applicable in multi host vectors).</p></details></div>

In fact, this is an unusual reaction given the unfavorable conditions for dehydration. This characteristic strongly contributes to the potential of SBLE to become a 'green' tool in industrial applications. Indeed, lactonization occurs normally in organic solvents, an application for which microbial lipases are increasingly used as biocatalysts. Previously, we described the production of recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). However, expression was not optimal to delve deeper into the enzyme's potential for industrial application. In the current study, we explored codon-optimization of the SBLE gene and we optimized the rSBLE expression protocol. Temperature reduction had the biggest impact followed by codon-optimization and co-expression of the HAC1 transcription factor. Combining these approaches, we achieved a 32-fold improvement of the yield during rSBLE production (from 0.75 mg/l to 24 mg/L culture) accompanied with a strong reduction of contaminants after affinity purification.</p></details></div>

In the present study, the gene of a previously characterized transmembrane protein glycerol transporter 1 (GT1) of P. pastoris GS115 was deleted by homologous recombination. Transcriptional profiles of the mutant (gt1Delta) and wild type (WT) were compared with different carbon sources (glycerol, methanol and glycerol-methanol mix) at various time points using high-throughput RNA-Seq techniques. We determined that the loss of glycerol transporter 1 (Gt1p) could relieve catabolite repression in the glycerol-methanol mixed medium and shared a similar transcriptional profile with the WT in methanol medium. By calculating the common differentially expressed genes in three distinct paired groups, genes involved in the stress response, nutrition deprivation and translational process were identified, explaining the potential roles of glycerol in the regulation of methanol metabolism. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis, the relationship between biological traits and the transcriptional profile was established. With the support of published research and our data, we propose two possible regulatory pathways that are involved in the regulation of catabolite repression (adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase /SNF1 and Mitogen-activated protein kinase/HOG), thereby providing potential targets for both research and industrial strain improvement.</p></details></div>

Pichia pastoris) is one of the most commonly used host systems for recombinant protein expression. Achieving targeted genetic modifications had been hindered by low frequencies of homologous recombination (HR). Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has been implemented for P. pastoris enabling gene knockouts based on indels (insertion, deletions) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at near 100% efficiency. However, specifically integrating homologous donor cassettes via HR for replacement studies had proven difficult resulting at most in approximately 20% correct integration using CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we demonstrate the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated integration of markerless donor cassettes at efficiencies approaching 100% using a ku70 deletion strain. The Ku70p is involved in NHEJ repair and lack of the protein appears to favor repair via HR near exclusively. While the absolute number of transformants in the Deltaku70 strain is reduced, virtually all surviving transformants showed correct integration. In the wildtype strain, markerless donor cassette integration was also improved up to 25-fold by placing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) on the donor cassette. Alternative strategies for improving donor cassette integration using a Cas9 nickase variant or reducing off targeting associated toxicity using a high fidelity Cas9 variant were so far not successful in our hands in P. pastoris. Furthermore we provide Cas9/gRNA expression plasmids with a Geneticin resistance marker which proved to be versatile tools for marker recycling. The reported CRSIPR-Cas9 tools can be applied for modifying existing production strains and also pave the way for markerless whole genome modification studies in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Two mating-type (MAT) loci include homologs of the MATa and MATalpha transcription factor genes, with the expression from one locus downregulated by telomere position effects. However, not much is known about mating gene regulation, since the mixture of mating types complicates detailed investigations. In this study, we developed K. phaffii strains with stable mating types by deletion of the inverted-repeat region required for mating-type switching. These heterothallic strains retain their ability to mate with cells of the opposite mating type and were used to further elucidate mating gene regulation. Functional analysis of MAT mutant strains revealed the essential role of MATa2 and MATalpha1 in diploid cell formation. Disruption of MATa1 or MATalpha2 did not affect mating; however, in diploid cells, both genes are required for sporulation and the repression of shmoo formation. The heterothallic strains generated in this study allowed the first detailed characterization of mating gene regulation in K. phaffii They will be a valuable tool for further studies investigating cell-type-specific behavior and will enable in-depth genetic analyses and strain hybridization in this industrially relevant yeast species.</p></details></div>

To explore additional GE enzymes, we used a genome mining strategy. BLAST analysis with characterized GEs against approximately 250 publicly accessible fungal genomes identified more than 150 putative fungal GEs, which were classified into eight phylogenetic sub-groups. To validate the genome mining strategy, 21 selected GEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris.

The ability of the ER targeted chaperones to improve production of bacterial protein in P. pastoris was evaluated. The chaperones tagged with alpha-factor secretion- and ER retention-signal sequences were co-expressed with either extracellularly secreted phytase or intracellular d-phenylglycine aminotransferase (D-PhgAT) enzymes. The ER residing GroEL-GroES successfully increased the levels of active phytase extracellularly, 1.5-2.3-fold higher than the phytase expression alone, but did not enhance the formation of active, intracellular D-PhgAT. These results indicate that the chaperones have the potential to enhance production of active enzymes when present in the same trafficking pathway.

Quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed LEG-1 to be almost exclusively transcribed and expressed in parasitic lungworm stages. Immunohistochemistry localized the enzyme in the parasite's gut, which was confirmed by immunoblots detecting LEG-1 in the gut as well as male testes. LEG-1 was recombinantly (rLEG-1) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and subsequently analysed in activity assays for its enzyme functions and substrate specificity. For sufficient functionality, rLEG-1 needed trans-activation through D. viviparus cathepsin L-2, indicating a novel mechanism of legumain activation. After trans-activation, rLEG-1 worked best at pH 5.5 and 35-39 degrees C and cleaved a legumain-specific artificial substrate as well as the natural substrates bovine collagen types I and II. In a clinical vaccination trial, rLEG-1 did not protect against challenge infection. Results of in vitro characterization, transcription pattern and localization enhance the presumption that LEG-1 participates in digestion processes of D. viviparus.

In the present work, molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between rGlLCC1 or rPOXA 1B enzymes with Crystal Violet (CV) or Malachite Green (MG) dyes. In addition, removal tests of the two dyes were performed. Van der Waals interactions were obtained for only the CV dye for both GlLCC1 and POXA 1B enzymes. Nevertheless, in the GlLCC1 model, two pi-pi interactions were observed. For the MG dye only, Van der Waals interactions were obtained. Moreover, amino acid composition interacting in each model with each dye was similar. It is important to highlight that by molecular docking, none of the estimated ligand configurations generated hydrogen bonds. Thus, explaining the difficulty to degrade CV and MG. Regarding CV, maximum decolorization percentage was 23.6 +/- 1.0% using Ganoderma lucidum supernatant and 5.0 +/- 0.5% with Pleurotus ostreatus supernatant.

Because of its extensive application in medicine, recombinant DNA technology has been considered for its production. The current study examines coexpression of A1AT and soluble domain of v-SNARE in Pichia pastoris, which can prevent the secretion of A1AT after thoroughly passing the secretory pathway. This was done mainly to preserve the biological activity of A1AT, which in the secretory mode might be impaired in the fermentation and early clarification conditions. SNARE proteins are the driving force for vesicle docking and membrane fusion in the exocytosis. Intracellular expression of the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE and its subsequent interaction to form SNARE complex can intensify the competition for A1AT secretory vesicles to be fused and released to the media. Our investigation shows successful coexpression of A1AT in the form of post-Golgi vesicles and the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE. Our findings confirmed the reduction of A1AT secretion by 45% caused accumulation of post-Golgi secretory vesicles filled with A1AT inside the yeast cell. A1AT trapped in secretory vesicles were biologically more active than secretory A1AT. These results indicate that the inhibition of A1AT secretion can protect its biological activity in fermentation and clarification processes.</p></details></div>
