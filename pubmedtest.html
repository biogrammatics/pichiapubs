P. Labade et al., Ecotoxicol Environ Saf 147 612 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923727>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The present study deals with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) based detoxification of pesticides in Helicoverpa armigera and its potential application in eliminating pesticides from the environment. Dietary exposure of a pesticide mixture (organophosphates - chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, pyrethroid - cypermethrin; 2-15ppm each) to H. armigera larvae resulted in a dose dependant up-regulation of GST activity and gene expression. A variant GST from H. armigera (HaGST-8) was isolated from larvae fed with 10ppm pesticide mixture and it was recombinantly expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris HaGST-8). HaGST-8 had a molecular mass of 29kDa and was most active at pH 9 at 30 degrees C. GC-MS and LC-HRMS analysis validated that HaGST-8 was effective in eliminating organophosphate type of pesticides and partially reduced the cypermethrin content (53%) from aqueous solutions. Unlike the untransformed yeast, P. pastoris HaGST-8 grew efficiently in media supplemented with pesticide mixtures (200 and 400ppm each pesticide) signifying the detoxification ability of HaGST-8. The amino acid sequence of HaGST-8 and the already reported sequence of HaGST-7 had just 2 mismatches. The studies on molecular interaction strengths revealed that HaGST-8 had stronger binding affinities with organophosphate, pyrethroid, organochloride, carbamate and neonicotinoid type of pesticides. The abilities of recombinant HaGST-8 to eliminate pesticides and P. pastoris HaGST-8 to grow profusely in the presence of high level of pesticide content can be applied for removal of such residues from food, water resources and bioremediation.</p></details><hr><h4>Evaluating Potential Risks of Food Allergy and Toxicity of Soy Leghemoglobin Expressed in Pichia Pastoris.</h4><p>Y. Jin et al., Mol Nutr Food Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28921896>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>SCOPE:</strong> The Soybean (Glycine max) leghemoglobin c2 (LegHb) gene was introduced into Pichia pastoris yeast for sustainable production of a heme-carrying protein, for organoleptic use in plant-based meat. The potential allergenicity and toxicity of LegHb and 17 Pichia host-proteins each representing >/=1% of total protein in production batches were evaluated by literature review, bioinformatics sequence comparisons to known allergens or toxins, and in vitro pepsin digestion.</p><p><strong> METHODS AND RESULTS:</strong> Literature searches found no evidence of allergenicity or toxicity for these proteins. There were no significant sequence matches of LegHb to known allergens or toxins. Eleven Pichia proteins had modest identity matches to minor environmental allergens and thirteen Pichia proteins had significant matches to proteins from toxic sources. Yet the matched allergens and toxins had similar matches to proteins from the commonly consumed yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, without evidence of food allergy or toxicity. The demonstrated history of safe use indicates additional tests for allergenicity and toxicity are not needed. The LegHb and Pichia sp. proteins were rapidly digested by pepsin at pH 2.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> These results demonstrate that foods containing recombinant soy LegHb produced in Pichia sp. are unlikely to present an unacceptable risk of allergenicity or toxicity to consumers.

Ladeveze et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 215 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28919928>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a class of powerful oxidative enzymes that have revolutionized our understanding of lignocellulose degradation. Fungal LPMOs of the AA9 family target cellulose and hemicelluloses. AA9 LPMO-coding genes have been identified across a wide range of fungal saprotrophs (Ascomycotina, Basidiomycotina, etc.), but so far they have not been found in more basal lineages. Recent genome analysis of the yeast Geotrichum candidum (Saccharomycotina) revealed the presence of several LPMO genes, which belong to the AA9 family.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, three AA9 LPMOs from G. candidum were successfully produced and biochemically characterized. The use of native signal peptides was well suited to ensure correct processing and high recombinant production of GcLPMO9A, GcLPMO9B, and GcLPMO9C in Pichia pastoris. We show that GcLPMO9A and GcLPMO9B were both active on cellulose and xyloglucan, releasing a mixture of soluble C1- and C4-oxidized oligosaccharides from cellulose. All three enzymes disrupted cellulose fibers and significantly improved the saccharification of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass upon addition to a commercial cellulase cocktail.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The unique enzymatic arsenal of G. candidum compared to other yeasts could be beneficial for plant cell wall decomposition in a saprophytic or pathogenic context. From a biotechnological point of view, G. candidum LPMOs are promising candidates to further enhance enzyme cocktails used in biorefineries such as consolidated bioprocessing.</p></details><hr><h4>Quantification of the Intracellular Life Time of Water Molecules to Measure Transport Rates of Human Aquaglyceroporins.</h4><p>M. Palmgren et al., J Membr Biol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28914342>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Orthodox aquaporins are transmembrane channel proteins that facilitate rapid diffusion of water, while aquaglyceroporins facilitate the diffusion of small uncharged molecules such as glycerol and arsenic trioxide. Aquaglyceroporins play important roles in human physiology, in particular for glycerol metabolism and arsenic detoxification. We have developed a unique system applying the strain of the yeast Pichia pastoris, where the endogenous aquaporins/aquaglyceroporins have been removed and human aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are recombinantly expressed enabling comparative permeability measurements between the expressed proteins. Using a newly established Nuclear Magnetic Resonance approach based on measurement of the intracellular life time of water, we propose that human aquaglyceroporins are poor facilitators of water and that the water transport efficiency is similar to that of passive diffusion across native cell membranes. This is distinctly different from glycerol and arsenic trioxide, where high glycerol transport efficiency was recorded.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and Characteristics of a Novel Xylose- and Alkali-tolerant GH 43 beta-xylosidase from Penicillium oxalicum for Promoting Hemicellulose Degradation.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, a novel intracellular glycoside hydrolase family 43 beta-xylosidase gene (xyl43) from Penicillium oxalicum 114-2 was successfully high-level overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and the secreted enzyme was characterized. The beta-xylosidase Xyl43 exhibited great pH stability and high catalytic activity in the range of pH 6.0 to 8.0, and high tolerance to xylose with the Ki value of 28.09 mM. The Xyl43 could effectively promote enzymatic degradation of different source of xylan and hemicellulose contained in alkaline-pretreated corn stover, and high conversion of xylan to xylose could be obtained.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel bi-directional promoter system allows tunable recombinant protein production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>V. Rajamanickam, K. Metzger, C. Schmid, O. Spadiut, Microb Cell Fact 16 152 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903770>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a well-studied host organism for recombinant protein production, which is usually regulated either by a constitutive promoter (e.g. promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGAP) or an inducible promoter (e.g. promoter of alcohol oxidase 1; PAOX1). Both promoter systems have several advantages and disadvantages; with one of the main disadvantages being their lack of tunability. Various novel promoter systems, which are either inducible or de-repressed, allowing higher degrees of freedom, have been reported. Recently, bi-directional promoter systems in P. pastoris with two promoter systems regulating recombinant expression of one or more genes were developed. In this study, we introduce a novel bi-directional promoter system combining a modified catalase promoter system (PDC; derepressible and inducible) and the traditional PAOX1, allowing tunable recombinant protein production.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We characterized a recombinant P. pastoris strain, carrying the novel bi-directional promoter system, during growth and production in three dynamic bioreactor cultivations. We cloned the model enzyme cellobiohydralase downstream of either promoter and applied different feeding strategies to determine the physiological boundaries of the strain. We succeeded in demonstrating tunability of recombinant protein production solely in response to the different feeding strategies and identified a mixed feed regime allowing highest productivity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this feasibility study, we present the first controlled bioreactor experiments with a recombinant P. pastoris strain carrying a novel bi-directional promotor combination of a catalase promoter variant (PDC) and the traditional PAOX1. We demonstrated that this bi-directional promoter system allows tunable recombinant protein expression only in response to the available C-sources. This bi-directional promoter system offers a high degree of freedom for bioprocess design and development, making bi-directional promoters in P. pastoris highly attractive for recombinant protein production.</p></details><hr><h4>COMPARATIVE PHYSIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF HYDROPHOBINS PRODUCED IN ESCHERICHIA COLI AND PICHIA PASTORIS.</h4><p>A. Przylucka et al., Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces 159 913 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903187>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hydrophobins (HFBs) are small surface-active proteins secreted by filamentous fungi. Being amphiphilic, they spontaneously form layers that convert surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and vice versa. We have compared properties of the class II HFB4 and HFB7 from Trichoderma virens as produced in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Since the production in E. coli required denaturation/renaturation steps because of inclusion bodies, this treatment was also applied to HFBs produced and secreted in yeast. The protein yields for both systems were similar. Both HFBs produced by E. coli proved less active on PET compared to HFBs produced in P. pastoris. HFBs produced in E. coli decreased the hydrophilicity of glass the most, which correlated with the adsorption of a more dense protein layer on glass compared to HFBs produced in P. pastoris. The hydrophobins produced in P. pastoris formed highly structured monolayers. Layers of hydrophobins produced in E. coli were less prone to self-organization. Our data suggests that irrespective of the production host, the HFBs could be used in various applications that are based on their surface activity. However, the production host and the subsequent purification procedure will influence the stability of HFB layers. In the area of high-value biomedical devices and nanomaterials, where the formation of highly ordered protein monolayers is essential, our results point to P. pastoris as the preferred production host. Furthermore, the choice of an appropriate hydrophobin for a given application appears to be equally important.</p></details><hr><h4>Double promoter expression systems for recombinant protein production by industrial microorganisms.</h4><p>S. Ozturk, B. G. Ergun, P. Calik, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28900685>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using double promoter expression systems is a promising approach to increase heterologous protein production. In this review, current double promoter expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins (r-proteins) by industrially important bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli; and yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, are discussed by assessing their potentials and drawbacks. Double promoter expression systems need to be designed to maintain a higher specific product formation rate within the production domain. While bacterial double promoter systems have been constructed as chimeric tandem promoters, yeast dual promoter systems have been developed as separate expression cassettes. To increase production and productivity, the optimal transcriptional activity should be justified either by simultaneously satisfying the requirements of both promoters, or by consecutively stimulating the changeover from one to another in a biphasic process or via successive-iterations. Thus, considering the dynamics of a fermentation process, double promoters can be classified according to their operational mechanisms, as: i) consecutively operating double promoter systems, and ii) simultaneously operating double promoter systems. Among these metabolic design strategies, extending the expression period with two promoters activated under different conditions, or enhancing the transcriptional activity with two promoters activated under similar conditions within the production domain, can be applied independently from the host. Novel studies with new insights, which aim a rational systematic design and construction of dual promoter expression vectors with tailored transcriptional activity, will empower r-protein production with enhanced production and productivity. Finally, the current state-of-the-art review emphasizes the advantages of double promoter systems along with the necessity for discovering new promoters for the development of more effective and adaptive processes to meet the increasing demand of r-protein industry.</p></details><hr><h4>Glycosylation is important for FcXTH1 activity as judged by its structural and biochemical characterization.</h4><p>A. Mendez-Yanez et al., Plant Physiol Biochem 119 200 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28898745>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (XTH) may have endotransglycosylase (XET) and/or hydrolase (XEH) activities. Previous studies suggest that XTHs might play a key role in ripening of Fragaria chiloensis fruit as FcXTH1 transcripts increase as fruit softens. FcXTH1 protein sequence contains a conserved N-glycosylation site adjacent to catalytic residues. The FcXTH1 structure was built through comparative modeling methodology, the structure displays a beta-jellyroll-type folding with a curvature generated by eight antiparallel beta-sheets that holds the catalytic motif that is oriented towards the central cavity of the protein. Through Molecular Dynamic Simulations (MDS) analyses the protein-ligand interactions of FcXTH1 were explored, finding a better interaction with xyloglucans than cellulose. Nevertheless, the stability of the protein-ligand complex depends on the glycosylation state of FcXTH1: better energy interactions were determined for the glycosylated protein. As a complement, the molecular cloning and heterologous expression of FcXTH1 in Pichia pastoris was performed, and the recombinant protein was active and displayed strict XET activity. A KM value of 17.0 muM was determined for xyloglucan oligomer. The deglycosylation of FcXTH1 by PNGase-F treatment affects its biochemical properties (increase KM and reduce kcat/KM ratio) and reduces its stability. As a conclusion, glycosylation of FcXTH1 is important for its biological function.</p></details><hr><h4>[Construction of Setosphaeria turcica STK1-EGFP fusion gene vector and its expression in Pichia pastoris].</h4><p>Y.

At first, the Pichia pastoris GS115 expression vector pPIC3.5K-EGFP containing enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP) was constructed, then STK1 gene was first amplified by PCR with the template of cDNA of S. turcica model isolate 01-23, and then cloned into the vector pPIC3.5K-EGFP with enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP) to construct the STK1-EGFP fusion gene expression vector pPIC3.5K-STK1-EGFP. The vector was transformed into the susceptible cells of Pichia pastoris GS115 by electric shock process, and the transformants were identified by MD medium screening and PCR determination. The STK1 gene and EGFP gene could be expressed effectively and stably in the transformants as detected by RT-PCR and fluorescence observation. In addition, we also found that the Kozak sequence before the start codon of STK1 gene could increase 4.8 folds expression level of STK1- EGFP fusion gene. The above research results laid a good foundation for subcellular localization and antibody preparation of STK1 protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Recycling of a selectable marker with a self-excisable plasmid in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C. Li et al., Sci Rep 7 11113 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28894268>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a widely used heterologous protein production workhorse. However, with its multiple genetic modifications to solve bottlenecks for heterologous protein productivity, P. pastoris lacks selectable markers. Existing selectable marker recycling plasmids have drawbacks (e.g., slow growth and conditional lethality). Here, zeocin-resistance marker recycling vectors were constructed using the Cre/loxP recombination system. The vectors were used to (i) knock in heterologous phytase, xylanase and lipase expression cassettes, (ii) increase the phytase, xylanase and lipase gene copy number to 13, 5, and 5, respectively, with vector introduction and (iii) engineer the secretion pathway by co-overexpressing secretion helper factors (Sly1p and Sec1p) without introducing selectable markers, giving a phytase field of 0.833 g/L. The vectors allow selectable marker recycling and would be a useful tool to engineer P. pastoris for high heterologous protein productivity.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of stable and active human DNA topoisomerase I in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. K. Chan et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893606>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study described the isolation of the coding region of human topoisomerase I (TopoI) from MDA-MB-231 and the expression of multiple copy recombinant genes in four Pichia pastoris strains. First, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplification of the enzyme coding region was performed. The PCR fragment was cloned into pPICZ-alpha-A vector and sequenced. It was then transformed into X33, GS115, SMD1168H and KM71H strains of Pichia. PCR-screening for positive clones was performed, and estimation of multiple copy integrants in each yeast strain was carried out using agar plates containing increasing concentrations of Zeocin(R). The selected clones of multiple copy recombinant genes were then induced for TopoI expression in shaker flasks. GS115 and SMD1168 were found to be better Pichia strains to accommodate the recombinant gene for expression of TopoI extracellularly. However, the DNA relaxation activity revealed that only the target enzyme in the culture supernatants of GS115-pPICZ-alpha-A-TopoI exhibited consistent enzyme activity over the cultivation time-points. Active enzyme activity was inhibited by Camptothecin. The enzyme produced can be used for affordable gel-based DNA relaxation assay development in performing high throughput screening for target-specific growth inhibitors that display similar effect as the TopoI inhibitors. These inhibitors may contribute to the improvement of the treatment of cancer patients.</p></details><hr><h4>Development of a high-throughput microscale cell disruption platform for Pichia pastoris in rapid bioprocess design.</h4><p>B. A. F. Blaha et al., Biotechnol Prog   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884522>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The time and cost benefits of miniaturized fermentation platforms can only be gained by employing complementary techniques facilitating high-throughput at small sample volumes. Microbial cell disruption is a major bottleneck in experimental throughput and is often restricted to large processing volumes. Moreover, for rigid yeast species such as Pichia pastoris, no effective high-throughput disruption methods exist. This study describes the development of an automated, miniaturized, high-throughput, non-contact, scalable platform based on Adaptive Focused Acoustics (AFA) to disrupt P. pastoris and recover intracellular heterologous protein. Augmented modes of AFA were established by investigating vessel designs and a novel enzymatic pre-treatment step. Three different modes of AFA were studied and compared to the performance high pressure homogenization. For each of these modes of cell disruption, response models were developed to account for five different performance criteria. Using multiple responses not only demonstrated that different operating parameters are required for different response optima, with highest product purity requiring suboptimal values for other criteria, but also allowed for AFA-based methods to mimic large-scale homogenization processes. These results demonstrate that AFA-mediated cell disruption can be used for a wide range of applications including buffer development, strain selection, fermentation process development and whole bioprocess integration.

In this study, ES products of T. muris and immune sera were produced. The immune sera recognized more than 20 proteins on a 2D-gel of ES products of T. muris adult worms. Tm16 was one of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry. Tm16 shares 57% sequence identity with Ov16, an immunodominant diagnostic antigen from Onchocerca volvulus. Recombinant Tm16 with a carboxyl terminal hexahistidine was produced using Pichia pastoris. Polyclonal antibodies against rTm16 were generated by one-prime and two-boost immunization of three female Balb/c mice with 25 mug of recombinant Tm16 emulsified with ISA720 adjuvant. These polyclonal antibodies confirmed that Tm16 is localized to the ES products and the soluble fraction of the adult worm. Additionally, the high-resolution crystal structure of Tm16 was solved by molecular replacement. Tm16 belongs to the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding-like protein (PEBP1) family and this is the first structure of a PEBP1 from a parasite.</p></details><hr><h4>[Secreted expression of Japanese encephalitis virus prME in Pichia pastoris and immunogenicity evaluation of the virus-like particles in mice].</h4><p>P.

The JEV prME gene was amplified by RT-PCR with genome RNA of JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 and subcloned into pPICZa-A vector, designated as pPICZalpha-prME. pPICZalpha-SprME was constructed same as pPICZalpha-prME besides with the additional 19 Aa signal peptides coding gene of the JEV cap protein C terminal. The linearized expression vector was integrated into the genome of Pichia pastoris X33 under the control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter and induced with methanol during fermentation expression. The expression of JEV prME protein was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and then it was purified by S-400 High Resolution HiPrep 16/60 Sephacry. The expressed products of Pichia pastoris were visualized by electron microscopy. In the immunization test, four groups of four-week old female mice were immunized subcutaneously with different doses purified JEV prME protein with complete Freund's adjuvant at a volumetric ratio of 1:1 and a control group was injected with sterile PBS. 10 mug/dose purified JEV prME protein mixing different doses nucleic acid adjuvant (Naa) was vaccinated in mice as the same mode. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting indicate that JEV prME was not cleaved between prM and E during secreted expression in Pichia pastoris. The purified recombinant prME was eluted in the first eluting peak which indicated that its molecular weight about 1x10(6) Da to 20x10(6) Da and may form a multimeric. Both the culture supernatant and the purified protein, examined by electron microscopy, we found to contain JEV virus like particles (VLPs) with diameters of 30-50 nm. The anti-JEV VLPs antibody titration reached peak at 3 wpi and still maintained in mice at 7 wpi inoculated with 10 mug and 15 mug prME. The strong antibody response was observed when the mice immunized with prME mixing nucleic acid adjuvant, which elicited high neutralizing antibody titer among 1:80 to 1:160. In conclusion, although JEV prME protein expressed in Pichia pastoris was not cleaved, which formed VLPs and showed efficient immunological properties in mice experiments.</p></details><hr><h4>[High-level expression and characterization of Selenomonas ruminantium beta-xylosidase in Pichia pastoris].</h4><p>T.

In the present research, beta-xylosidase gene Sxa derived from Selenomonas ruminantium was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. According to the codon bias and rare codons of P. pastoris, mRNA secondary structure and GC content, Sxa gene was optimized. The optimized full-length gene mSxa was obtained by gene synthesis technique and the recombinant yeast expression vector pPIC9K-mSxa was constructed. After being digested by restriction enzyme Bgl, the mSxa gene was transformed into P. pastoris GS115. Then, phenotype and geneticin G418 resistance screening, and PCR were adopted to identify the positive transformants. Finally, the recombinant P. pastoris GS115-pPIC9K-mSxa was obtained. Based on enzymatic activity assay, a high-level expression clone was picked up and then the enzymatic characteristics of the recombinant beta-xylosidase were studied. The results showed that the molecular weight of the mSxa expressed in P. pastoris G115 was about 66 kDa. The maximum activity was achieved 287.61 IU/mL at fermenter level. Enzymatic characterization showed the beta-xylosidase was stable between 40 and 60 , and pH between 5.0 and 7.0. The optimal reaction temperature and pH were 55 and 6.0, and preferentially degrading the beta-xylose glycosidic bond. The enzymatic activity was activated by Mn(2)(+) and Ca(2)(+), and inhibited by Fe(3)(+), Cu(2)(+), Co(2)(+), Mg(2)(+), EDTA and SDS. The study indicates that the modified beta-xylosidase gene mSxa from Selenomonas ruminantium can express successfully with high activity in P. pastoris.

After screening, a mutant strain CL012 with 12 copies was obtained on the YPDS plate containing 4.0 mg/mL G418. Then, the components of SNAREs (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins), SNC2 and SNC2-SSO2, were expressed in the strain CL012 to explore the effect of SNAREs on the yield of PI. In shake flask culture, the strains expressing SNC2 and SNC2-SSO2 yielded PI of 1.89 mg/L and 2.21 mg/L after methanol induction for 96 h, which were improved by 23.53% and 44.44% compared to that of strain CL012 (1.53 mg/L), respectively. Further, in a 5-L bioreactor, the yield of PI with strain CL012 was 53 mg/L for high-density fermentation, after 96 h of methanol induction, which was 34.64-fold higher than that of shake culture. The strains expressing SNC2 and SNC2-SSO2 yielded the PI of 64 mg/L and 78 mg/L, which were respectively increased by 20.75% and 47.17%, compared to that of strain CL012.

This study aims to improve the secretion of recombinant CRP by Pichia pastoris via optimizing signal peptides, promoters and carbon sources. The CRP genes with encoding four different signal peptides were designed and synthesized. The genes were cloned into pPICZalphaA or pPICZ B, respectively via splicing by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR) technology and expressed in P. pastoris X-33, regulated by the alcohol oxidase I promoter (pAOX1). The CRP led by the alpha-mating factor secretion signal peptide (alpha-MF) was secreted at the highest level in these signal peptides. Then, a constitutive construct and expression of the CRP genes were achieved by switching to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (pGAP). Subsequently, different carbon sources and at different concentrations were used to further improve the secretion of CRP. The expression of CRP with the alpha-MF driven by the pGAP gave the highest yield of secreted CRP, about 3 mg/l of culture on the optimized culture conditions. The purified recombinant CRP exhibited good immunoreactivity determined by ELISA with anti-human CRP monoclonal antibody. The efficient engineering strategy established in this work might provide potential uses in large-scale industrial production of human CRP in the future.</p></details><hr><h4>Malachite Green and Crystal Violet Decolorization by Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus Supernatant and by rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B Concentrates: Molecular Docking Analysis.</h4><p>E.

Triphenylmethane dyes are synthetic compounds widely used in diverse industries. Their removal from effluents is difficult, due to their high degree of structural complexity; hence, their high concentration in effluents cause a negative impact on the environment. In the present work, molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between rGlLCC1 or rPOXA 1B enzymes with Crystal Violet (CV) or Malachite Green (MG) dyes. In addition, removal tests of the two dyes were performed. Van der Waals interactions were obtained for only the CV dye for both GlLCC1 and POXA 1B enzymes. Nevertheless, in the GlLCC1 model, two pi-pi interactions were observed. For the MG dye only, Van der Waals interactions were obtained. Moreover, amino acid composition interacting in each model with each dye was similar. It is important to highlight that by molecular docking, none of the estimated ligand configurations generated hydrogen bonds. Thus, explaining the difficulty to degrade CV and MG. Regarding CV, maximum decolorization percentage was 23.6 +/- 1.0% using Ganoderma lucidum supernatant and 5.0 +/- 0.5% with Pleurotus ostreatus supernatant. When using recombinant laccase enzyme concentrates, decolorization percentages were 9.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.5 +/- 1.0% for rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B, respectively. On the other hand, for the MG dye, maximum decolorization percentages were 52.1 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2% using G. lucidum and P. ostreatus concentrates, respectively. Whereas with recombinant laccase enzymatic concentrates, values of 9.4 +/- 0.8% were obtained, with rGlLCC1, and 2.1 +/- 0.1% when using rPOXA 1B. These findings represent an important step in bioremediation processes improvement and efficiency of industry-generated products, using environmentally friendly alternatives.</p></details><hr><h4>Development of a general defined medium for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C. Bartlett Matthews, A. Kuo, K. Routenberg Love, J. Christopher Love, Biotechnol Bioeng   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28865117>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is widely used as a host for recombinant protein production. More than 500 proteins have been expressed in the organism at a variety of cultivation scales, from small shake flasks to large bioreactors. Large-scale fermentation strategies typically employ chemically-defined growth medium because of its greater batch-to-batch consistency and in many cases, lower costs compared to complex medium. For biopharmaceuticals, defined growth medium may also simplify downstream purification and regulatory documentation. Standard formulations of defined media for Pichia pastoris are minimal ones that lack the metabolic intermediates provided by complex components such as peptone and yeast extract. As a result, growth rates and per-cell productivities are significantly lower than in complex medium. We have designed a rich defined medium (RDM) for Pichia pastoris by systematically evaluating nutrients of increasing complexity and identifying those that are most critical for growth. We have also demonstrated that using RDM for expression of three heterologous proteins yields titers comparable to, or higher than, those in standard complex medium. Rich defined medium improves productivity of Pichia pastoris fermentations and its development demonstrates the usefulness of transcriptomics to accelerate process development for new molecules.

In this study, genes encoding the full-length (cgkZ), Por secretion tail-truncated (cgkZDeltaPst) and carbohydrate binding domain-truncated (cgkZDeltaCBM) kappa-carrageenase proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The copy numbers of gene cgkZ, cgkZDeltaPst and cgkZDeltaCBM were 7, 7 and 6, respectively. The enzymatic activities of recombinant enzymes cgkZ, cgkZDeltaPst and cgkZDeltaCBM reached 4.68, 5.70, and 3.02 U/mL, respectively, after 120 h of shake flask fermentation at 22 degrees C and pH 6 in the presence of 1 % (v/v) methanol. The molecular weights of recombinant cgkZ, cgkZDeltaPst, and cgkZDeltaCBM were approximately 65, 45, and 40 kDa; their Km values were 2.07, 1.85, and 1.04 mg/mL; and they exhibited optimal activity at 45-50 degrees C and pH 6-7. All the recombinant enzymes were stimulated by Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and dithiothreitol. The end-products of enzymatic hydrolysis were mainly composed of kappa-carrageenan tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide. The removal of the Por secretion tail of kappa-carrageenase promoted the transcription of kappa-carrageenase gene, enhancing the specific activity of kappa-carrageenase without significantly changing its catalytic properties. Although the transcription level of kappa-carrageenase gene after the removal of the carbohydrate binding domain was relatively high, the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme significantly decreased. The comprehensive application of the P. pastoris expression system combined with the rational modification of genes may provide a novel approach for the heterologous expression of various marine enzymes with high activities.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant neuritin affects the senescence, apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</h4><p>W.

We previously isolated the cDNA that codes for a laccase isozyme (Lac2a) from the medicinal mushroom Agaricus brasiliensis (Matsumoto-Akanuma et al., Int. J. Med. Mushrooms, 16, 375-393, 2014). In this study, we first attempted heterologous expression of the wild-type laccase using a Pichia pastoris secretory expression system. However, the trial was unsuccessful most likely because the enzyme was too unstable and degraded immediately after production. Therefore, we improved the stability of the laccase by using a phylogeny-based design method. We created a mutant laccase in which sixteen original residues were replaced with those found in the phylogenetically inferred ancestral sequence. The resulting mutant protein was successfully produced using the P. pastoris secretory expression system and then purified. The designed laccase showed catalytic properties similar to those of other fungal laccases. Moreover, the laccase is highly thermally stable at acidic and neutral pH and is also stable at alkaline pH at moderate temperatures. We expect that the laccase will serve as a useful tool for enzymatic polymerization of di-phenolic compounds.</p></details><hr><h4>Active Expression of Human Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) c-DNA from Pulmonary Metastases in the Methylotrophic Yeast Pichia Pastoris KM71H Strain</h4><p>A. H. Mohseni et al., Asian Pac J Cancer Prev 18 2249 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28843264>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Background: Human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a key protease of the trypsin family. It catalyzes the activation of zymogen plasminogen to the fibrin-degrading proteinase, plasmin, leading to digestion of fibrin clots. The recombinant enzyme produced by recombinant technology issued to dissolve blood clots in treatment of various human diseases such as coronary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Pichia pastoris expression system is a unique system for the production of high level of recombinant proteins. GS115 and KM71H are two kinds of Pichia pastoris strains whilst production of recombinant proteins in these strains is not predictable. The aim of the study was evaluation of t-PA expression in KM71H strains. Methods: In this study, the cDNA of the t-PA gene was amplified by PCR, sequenced and cloned into Pichia pastoris KM71H host strain using pPICZalphaA expression vector that allows methanol-induced expression and secretion of the protein. Results: Dot blotting results confirmed the presence oft-PA in the cell supernatant. Western blotting test revealed the approximate size of 70 KDa for recombinant t-PA. Quantitative ELISA experiment showed 810 mug/L of t-PA in the supernatant samples. Zymography analysis confirmed the proteolytic activity and biological function of the expressed recombinant t-PA. Conclusions: Correspondingly, Pichia pastoris KM71H is an appropriate strain for production of active recombinant protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and expression of the recombinant crustacean hyperglycemic hormone isoform B2 (rCHH-B2) and its effects on the metabolism and osmoregulation of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.</h4><p>L. Camacho-Jimenez et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28842215>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Crustacean hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs) are multifunctional neuropeptides ubiquitous in crustaceans. In Litopenaeus vannamei, CHH-B2 is a CHH eyestalk isoform whose expression has been shown to vary with enviromental conditions, suggesting its relevance for ecophysiological performance of shrimp, controlling processes related to metabolism and osmo-ionic regulation. To study the involvement of CHH-B2 in these processes, we cloned and expressed a recombinant version with a free C-terminal glycine (rCHH-B2-Gly) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The rCHH-B2-Gly peptide secreted to the culture medium was purified by RP-HPLC and used for in vivo glucose, triglyceride, and osmoregulation dose-response analyses with juvenile shrimp. The peptide was also amidated at the C-terminus using an alpha-amidating enzyme to produce rCHH-B2-amide. The shrimp showed a dose-dependent effect of rCHH-B2-Gly to hemolymph glucose and triglyceride levels, inducing maximal increases by injecting 500 and 1000pmol of hormone, respectively. Additionally, 10pmol of hormone was sufficient to reduce the hypo-osmoregulatory capacity of shrimp at 35 per thousand. These findings suggest that CHH-B2 has regulatory roles in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and a potential involvement in osmoregulation of L. vannamei. Injection of 100pmol of rCHH-B2-amide increased glucose and triglyceride levels by 15 and 28%, respectively in comparison with rCHH-B2-Gly, suggesting an important role for the C-terminal amidation. Additionally, an in silico structural analysis done with the CHH-B1 and rCHH-B2-Gly peptides suggests that the C-terminal region may be relevant for the activity of the L. vannamei isoforms and explain the functional divergence from other crustacean CHH/CHH-like peptides.</p></details><hr><h4>A new type of gene-disruption cassette with a rescue gene for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>T. Shibui, H. Hara, Biotechnol Prog   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28840657>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris has been used for the production of many recombinant proteins, and many useful mutant strains have been created. However, the efficiency of mutant isolation by gene-targeting is usually low and the procedure is difficult for those inexperienced in yeast genetics. In order to overcome these issues, we developed a new gene-disruption system with a rescue gene using an inducible Cre/mutant-loxP system. With only short homology regions, the gene-disruption cassette of the system replaces its target-gene locus containing a mutation with a compensatory rescue gene. As the cassette contains the AOX1 promoter-driven Cre gene, when targeted strains are grown on media containing methanol, the DNA fragment, i.e., the marker, rescue and Cre genes, between the mutant-loxP sequences in the cassette is excised, leaving only the remaining mutant-loxP sequence in the genome, and consequently a target gene-disrupted mutant can be isolated. The system was initially validated on ADE2 gene disruption, where the disruption can easily be detected by color-change of the colonies. Then, the system was applied for knocking-out URA3 and OCH1 genes, reported to be difficult to accomplish by conventional gene-targeting methods. All three gene-disruption cassettes with their rescue genes replaced their target genes, and the Cre/mutant-loxP system worked well to successfully isolate their knock-out mutants. This study identified a new gene-disruption system that could be used to effectively and strategically knock out genes of interest, especially whose deletion is detrimental to growth, without using special strains, e.g., deficient in nonhomologous end-joining, in P. pastoris.

Bazon et al., Toxins (Basel) 9  (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28837089>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Polybia paulista (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is responsible for a high number of sting accidents and anaphylaxis events in Southeast Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. The specific detection of allergy to the venom of this wasp is often hampered by the lack of recombinant allergens currently available for molecular diagnosis. Antigen 5 (~23 kDa) from P. paulista venom (Poly p 5) is a highly abundant and glycosylated allergenic protein that could be used for development of component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Here, we describe the cloning and heterologous expression of the antigen 5 (rPoly p 5) from P. paulista venom using the eukaryotic system Pichia pastoris. The expression as a secreted protein yielded high levels of soluble rPoly p 5. The recombinant allergen was further purified to homogeneity (99%) using a two-step chromatographic procedure. Simultaneously, the native form of the allergen (nPoly p 5) was purified from the wasp venom by Ion exchange chromatography. The rPoly p 5 and nPoly p 5 were then submitted to a comparative analysis of IgE-mediated immunodetection using sera from patients previously diagnosed with sensitization to wasp venoms. Both rPoly p 5 and nPoly p 5 were recognized by specific IgE (sIgE) in the sera of the allergic individuals. The high levels of identity found between nPoly p 5 and rPoly p 5 by the alignment of its primary sequences as well as by 3-D models support the results obtained in the immunoblot. Overall, we showed that P. pastoris is a suitable system for production of soluble rPoly p 5 and that the recombinant allergen represents a potential candidate for molecular diagnosis of P.paulista venom allergy.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the catalytic characteristics of lipase-displaying yeast cells by hydrophobic modification.</h4><p>K.

However, the hydrophilic characteristics of the yeast cell surface may impede efficient immobilisation. Herein, we tested three methods to enhance the hydrophobicity of the surface of Candida antarctica lipase B-displaying Pichia pastoris cells, co-displaying a fungal hydrophobin, coating with ionic liquids, and adding decane as a hydrophobic carbon source during fermentation. Modified cells showed higher surface hydrophobicity and superior esterification of C6-C18 saturated fatty acids in hydrophobic solvents. When used for biodiesel synthesis, modified cells exhibited an improved initial reaction rate and equilibrium fatty acid methyl ester yield. We systematically discuss the influence of cell surface hydrophobicity on the catalytic properties, and the results provide guidance for improving the catalytic efficiency and operational characteristics of lipase-displaying yeast cells for organic bioconversions.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of the antimicrobial peptide ABP-dHC-cecropin A in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

To explore a new approach for expression of ABP-dHC-cecropin A using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, we cloned the ABP-dHC-cecropin A gene into the vector pPICZalphaA. The SacI-linearized plasmid pPICZalphaA-ABP-dHC-cecropin A was then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation. Expression was induced after a 96-h incubation with 0.5% methanol at 20 degrees C in a culture supplied with 2% casamino acids to avoid proteolysis. Under these conditions, approximately 48 mg of ABP-dHC-cecropin A was secreted into 1L (4 x 250-mL)of medium. Recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was purified using size-exclusion chromatography, and 21 mg of pure active ABP-dHC-cecropin A was obtained from 1L (4 x 250-mL)of culture. Electrophoresis on 4-20% gradient gels indicated that recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was secreted as a protein approximately 4 kDa in size. Recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was successfully expressed, as the product displayed antibacterial and antifungal activities (based on an antibacterial assay, scanning electron microscopy, and antifungal assay) indistinguishable from those of the synthesized protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural Insights into the Mode of Action of the Peptide Antibiotic Copsin.</h4><p>M. Franzoi et al., Biochemistry 56 4992 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28825809>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Defensins make up a class of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides, expressed by virtually all eukaryotes as part of their innate immune response. Because of their unique mode of action and rapid killing of pathogenic microbes, defensins are considered promising alternatives to clinically applied antibiotics. Copsin is a defensin-like peptide, previously identified in the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea. It exerts its activity against a range of Gram-positive bacteria by binding to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and prevention of proper cell wall formation. In this study, we present a new workflow for the generation, production, and activity-driven selection of copsin derivatives, based on their expression in Pichia pastoris. One hundred fifty-two single-amino acid mutants and combinations thereof allowed the identification of k-copsin, a peptide variant exhibiting significantly enhanced activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, we performed in silico characterizations of membrane interactions of copsin and k-copsin, in the presence and absence of lipid II. The molecular dynamics data highlighted a high variability in lipid II binding, with a preference for the MurNAc moiety with 47 and 35% of the total contacts for copsin and k-copsin, respectively. Mutated amino acids were located in loop regions of k-copsin and shown to be crucial in the perturbation of the bacterial membrane. These structural studies provide a better understanding of how defensins can be developed toward antibacterial therapies less prone to resistance issues.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative analysis of the effect of protein Z4 from barley malt and recombinant Pichia pastoris on beer foam stability: Role of N-glycosylation and glycation.</h4><p>C.

The malt protein Z4 and recombinant protein Z4 showed similar N-glycosylation patterns while recombinant protein Z4 was glycosylated at a higher degree. In the simulated mashing and boiling, malt protein Z4 and deglycosylated malt protein Z4 preferred to glycate with glucose and maltose while recombinant protein Z4 and deglycosylated recombinant protein Z4 showed preference towards fructose. The addition of protein Z4 and protein Z4-saccharide complexes in finished beer showed that the addition of glycosylated protein Z4 only slightly enhanced the beer foam stability while the addition of glycated protein Z4 and protein Z4 with both glycation and glycosylation could significantly increase the beer foam stability. Therefore, glycation instead of N-glycosylation of protein Z4 played important roles in maintaining beer foam stability.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of a novel thermostable Sclerotinia sclerotiorum GH45 endoglucanase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

Mainly endoglucanases were found to be a prerequisite for the quick initial biomass liquefaction. In the present study, Pichia pastoris was used as a host for the heterologous expression of a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum GH45 endoglucanase, Endo2. The recombinant plasmid pPICZalphaA was used to transform Pichia pastoris. Pichia culture supernatants expressing the recombinant Endo2 (rEndo2) were used for the purification and biochemical characterization of this enzyme. Therefore, rEndo2 was purified 6.7 fold to homogeneity with 34% yield and gave 19U/mg specific activity. It also showed maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C (against pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C for the native enzyme) and was thermostable at relatively high temperatures. Furthermore, rEndo2 retained its activity in a wide pH range (from 5 to 8). Besides, the recombinant endoglucanase was produced as an active 47kDa enzyme. This molecular weight differs from the one of the native enzyme (34kDa), which suggested a potential glycosylation of the recombinant enzyme. Moreover, rEndo2 was able to produce fermentable sugars after enzymatic assay on various cellulosic substrates with an interesting yield. Therefore, all these features offer prospects for large-scale production and industrial application of the recombinant endoglucanase.</p></details><hr><h4>The heterologous expression strategies of antimicrobial peptides in microbial systems.</h4><p>T.

Compared to traditional antibiotics, AMPs are more stable and have lower propensity for developing resistance through functioning in the innate immune system, thus having important applications in the fields of medicine, food and so on. However, despite of their high economic values, the low yield and the cumbersome extraction process in AMPs production are problems that limit their industrial application and scientific research. To conquer these obstacles, optimized heterologous expression technologies were developed that could provide effective ways to increase the yield of AMPs. In this review, the research progress on heterologous expression of AMPs using Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as host cells was mainly summarized, which might guide the expression strategies of AMPs in these cells.</p></details><hr><h4>The Magnaporthe oryzae Alt A 1-like protein MoHrip1 binds to the plant plasma membrane.</h4><p>Y.

To determine the location of MoHrip1 in M. oryzae, a mohrip1-gfp mutant was generated. Fluorescence microscopy observations and western blotting analysis showed that MoHrip1 was both present in the secretome and abundant in the fungal cell wall. To obtain MoHrip1 protein, we carried out high-yield expression of MoHrip1 in Pichia pastoris. Treatment of tobacco plants with MoHrip1 induced the formation of necrosis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and expression of several defense-related genes, as well as conferred disease resistance. By fusion to green fluorescent protein, we showed that MoHrip1 was able to bind to the tobacco and rice plant plasma membrane, causing rapid morphological changes at the cellular level, such as cell shrinkage and chloroplast disorganization. These findings indicate that MoHrip1 is a microbe-associated molecular pattern that is perceived by the plant immune system. This is the first study on an AA1 family protein that can bind to the plant plasma membrane.</p></details><hr><h4>The versatile functions of LRR-only proteins in mollusk Chlamys farreri.</h4><p>M.

In the present study, three novel LRR-only proteins, CfLRRop-4, CfLRRop-5 and CfLRRop-6, were identified and characterized from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. They all contained LRR motifs with consensus signature sequences of LxxLxLxxNxL or LxxLxLxxCxxL. All the mRNA transcripts of three CfLRRops were high abundant in hepatopancreas, gills and gonads, and their mRNA transcripts in hemocytes could respond to the stimulations of different microbes, including Vibrio anguillarum, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. These three CfLRRops exhibited similar ligand binding and recognition characteristics as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). The immune effectors, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, superoxide dismutase, catalase and lysozyme, varied significantly after the scallops were stimulated by recombinant LRR-only proteins. All these results indicated that LRR-only proteins are functionally differentiated and exhibit different immunomodulation activities on various downstream immune effectors.</p></details><hr><h4>UBX domain-containing proteins are involved in lipid homeostasis and stress responses in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

UBX proteins can bind to the N-terminal region of Cdc48 to perform endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this study, we identified two UBX domain-containing proteins, Ubx1 and Ubx2, in Pichia pastoris and found that the two proteins could recover the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in ubx2Delta. Our results revealed that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play critical roles in synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by affecting Spt23. In addition, the results demonstrated that both Ubx1 and Ubx2 are involved in lipid droplet formation and protein degradation. Deletion of UBX1 led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and disruption of UBX2 impaired cell viability under osmotic stress. The phenotypes of ubx1Delta+UBX2, ubx2Delta+UBX1 and ubx1Deltaubx2Delta and RNA-seq data suggested that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play different roles in cell functions, and the roles of Ubx1 may be more numerous than Ubx2. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the relationship between lipid homeostasis and cell functions in the oil-producing organism P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical characterization of Aspergillus oryzae recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Specific activity of the enzyme was higher toward hesperidin than toward naringin, which consist of alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,2 linkages, respectively. The activity was also higher toward hesperidin than toward rutin, which consist of 7-O- and 3-O-glycosyl linkages of flavonoids, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme showed that the Michaelis constant (Km) was lowest toward rutin, moderate toward naringin, and higher toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside and hesperidin. Its high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward rutin was results of its low Km value while its high catalytic efficiency toward hesperidin was results of a considerably high kcat value.</p></details><hr><h4>The adaptive landscape of wildtype and glycosylation-deficient populations of the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. W. Moser, I. B. H. Wilson, M. Dragosits, BMC Genomics 18 597 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797224>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The effects of long-term environmental adaptation and the implications of major cellular malfunctions are still poorly understood for non-model but biotechnologically relevant species. In this study we performed a large-scale laboratory evolution experiment with 48 populations of the yeast Pichia pastoris in order to establish a general adaptive landscape upon long-term selection in several glucose-based growth environments. As a model for a cellular malfunction the implications of OCH1 mannosyltransferase knockout-mediated glycosylation-deficiency were analyzed.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In-depth growth profiling of evolved populations revealed several instances of genotype-dependent growth trade-off/cross-benefit correlations in non-evolutionary growth conditions. On the genome level a high degree of mutational convergence was observed among independent populations. Environment-dependent mutational hotspots were related to osmotic stress-, Rim - and cAMP signaling pathways. In agreement with the observed growth phenotypes, our data also suggest diverging compensatory mutations in glycosylation-deficient populations. High osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway loss-of-functions mutations, including genes such as SSK2 and SSK4, represented a major adaptive strategy during environmental adaptation. However, genotype-specific HOG-related mutations were predominantly observed in opposing environmental conditions. Surprisingly, such mutations emerged during salt stress adaptation in OCH1 knockout populations and led to growth trade-offs in non-adaptive conditions that were distinct from wildtype HOG-mutants. Further environment-dependent mutations were identified for a hitherto uncharacterized species-specific Gal4-like transcriptional regulator involved in environmental sensing.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> We show that metabolic constraints such as glycosylation-deficiency can contribute to evolution on the molecular level, even in non-diverging growth environments. Our dataset suggests universal adaptive mechanisms involving cellular stress response and cAMP/PKA signaling but also the existence of highly species-specific strategies involving unique transcriptional regulators, improving our biological understanding of distinct Ascomycetes species.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of Functional Anti-Ebola Antibodies in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

Here, we propose an efficient development cycle using glycoengineered Pichia pastoris to produce monoclonal antibody cocktails against pathogens. To enable rapid genetic engineering of P. pastoris, we introduced a genomic landing pad for reliable recombinase-mediated DNA integration. We then created strains expressing each of the three monoclonal antibodies that comprise the ZMapp cocktail, and demonstrated that the secreted antibodies bind to the Ebola virus glycoprotein by immunofluorescence assay. We anticipate that this approach could accelerate the production of therapeutics against future pathogen outbreaks.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and characterization of a novel Colletotrichum graminicola raffinose oxidase in the AA5 family.</h4><p>M. Andberg et al., Appl Environ Microbiol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778886>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We describe here the identification and characterization of a copper radical oxidase from Auxiliary Activities Family 5 (AA5_2) that was distinguished by showing preferential activity towards raffinose. Despite the biotechnological potential of carbohydrate oxidases from family AA5, very few members have been characterized. The gene encoding raffinose oxidase activity from Colletotrichum graminicola, (Cg RaOx; EC 1.1.3.-) was identified utilizing a bioinformatics approach based on the known modular structure of a characterized AA5_2 galactose oxidase. Cg RaOx was expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified enzyme displayed the highest activity on the trisaccharide raffinose, whereas the activity on the disaccharide melibiose was three times lower and more than ten times lower activity was detected on D-galactose at 300 mM substrate concentration. Thus, the substrate preference of Cg RaOx distinguished clearly from the known galactose oxidases. The site of oxidation for raffinose was studied by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry, and confirmed that the hydroxyl group at the C6 position was oxidized to an aldehyde, and that in addition uronic acid was produced as a side product. A new ESI-MS method for the identification of C-6 oxidized products was developed and the formation mechanism of the uronic acid studied. Cg RaOx presented a novel activity pattern in the AA5 family.Importance Currently there are only a few characterized members of the CAZy AA5 protein family. These enzymes are interesting from an application point of view because of their ability to utilize the cheap and abundant oxidant O2 without the requirement ofcomplex cofactors such as FAD or NAD(P). Here we present the identification and characterization of a novel AA5 member from Colletotrichum graminicola As discussed in the paper, the bioinformatics approach using the modular structure of galactose oxidase was successful in finding a C6-OH carbohydrate oxidase having substrate preference for the trisaccharide raffinose. By the discovery of this activity, the diversity of the CAZy AA5 family is increasing.</p></details><hr><h4>An automated data-driven DSP development approach for glycoproteins from yeast.</h4><p>V.

In a previous study, we purified three recombinant glycoproteins from Pichia pastoris using a simple two-step flowthrough mode approach using monolithic columns. In this study, we investigated a novel automated data science approach for identifying purification conditions for such glycoproteins using monolithic columns. We performed three sets of design of experiments (DoEs) in analytical scale to determine the separation efficiency of monolithic columns for three different recombinant horseradish peroxidase (HRP) isoenzymes. For ease of calculation, we introduced an arbitrary term, the relative impurity removal (IR), which is representative of the amount of impurities cleared. Both, the experimental part and the data analysis were automated and took less than 40 min for each HRP isoenzyme. We tested the identified purification conditions in laboratory scale and performed respective offline analyses to verify results from analytical scale. We found a clear correlation between the IR estimated online through our novel data driven approach and the IR determined offline. Summarizing, we present a novel methodology, applying analytical scale advantages which can be used for fast and efficient DSP development for recombinant glycoproteins from yeast without offline analyses.

Because one of the major bottlenecks for the therapeutic uses of proteins produced in Escherichia coli is their potential contamination with endotoxins, LPS were extensively removed by a rather low-efficient, expensive, and time-consuming purification step. In addition, disulfide scrambling is favored in the reducing bacterial cytoplasm albeit the use of reductase deficient strains. To overcome these hurdles, as well as to improve the yield, the yeast Pichia pastoris, an endotoxin-free host system for recombinant protein production, has been used to produce scFv-h3D6, both in flask and in a fed-batch bioreactor. Comparison of the thermal stability of the obtained protein with that from E. coli showed no differences. Opposite to the case of the protein obtained from E. coli, no disulfide scrambled conformations or LPS traces were detected in that produced in P. pastoris. Cytotoxicity assays in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell-cultures demonstrated that proteins from both expression systems were similarly efficient in precluding Abeta-induced toxicity. Finally, the 3xTg-AD mouse model was used to test the therapeutic effect of both proteins. Quantification of Abeta levels from cortex and hippocampus protein extracts by ELISA, and Abeta-immunohistochemistry, showed that both proteins reduced Abeta burden. This work demonstrates that scFv-h3D6 obtained from P. pastoris shows the same benefits as those already known for that obtained from E. coli, with multiple advantages in terms of recombinant production and safety.</p></details><hr><h4>Two acidic, thermophilic GH28 polygalacturonases from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM 12802 with application potentials for grape juice clarification.</h4><p>Y.

Two novel polygalacturonases (exo-TePG28a and endo-TePG28b) were identified in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802, overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized in this report. The specific activities of TePG28a and TePG28b towards polygalacturonic acid were 280+/-9 and 25,900+/-502U/mg, respectively. Both enzymes exhibited optimal activities at pH 3.5 and retained highly stable over a broad pH range of 2.0-7.0. Distinct from most fungal polygalacturonases that have low temperature optima, TePG28a and TePG28b were optimally active at 70 degrees C. When treated the grape juice with the enzyme combination (the unit ratio of TePG28a:TePG28b was 1:4), higher pectin-degrading efficiency (up to 140%) was achieved, and light transmittance was improved from 14% to 82%. These favorable enzymatic properties make TePG28a and TePG28b attractive for the applications in the juice industry.</p></details><hr><h4>An improved process for the production of highly purified recombinant thaumatin tagged-variants.</h4><p>R.

Thaumatin is used in the food and beverage industry as a low-calorie sugar substitute. Thaumatin interacts with taste receptors in the oral cavity eliciting a persistent sweet taste and a bitter, liquorice flavor. Recombinant thaumatin was expressed in Pichia pastoris and through a co-expression strategy with a molecular chaperone, yields of one engineered thaumatin variant increased by greater than two-fold. A detailed purification strategy for thaumatin is reported resulting in a homogenous sample recovered at a yield of 42%. The recombinant thaumatins were extensively characterised using size exclusion chromatography for homogeneity, reversed-phase HPLC for purity (99%), peptide digest LC-MS/MS for sequence determination, and circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopies for conformational characterisation. These new thaumatin variants are amenable for bioconjugation, providing chemical biology tools for thaumatin:taste receptor interaction studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Co-expression of lipase isozymes for enhanced expression in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

The results showed that the Kex2-mediated co-expression of lipase isozymes could express Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) and Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) simultaneously, and GS-RMk-kTL displayed an average lipase activity of 306.91 U ml-1 , higher than GS-RML and GS-kTL (2.89 and 300.59 U ml-1 ) expressed independently in P. pastoris, and the sum of both (303.48 U ml-1 ), implying the potential of isozyme co-expression mediated by Kex2 in increasing the overall recombinant expression, but the low recombinant expression of RML in P. pastoris weakened the overall increasing effect on lipase expression in the isozyme co-expression strains. In addition, the fusion isozymes were successfully expressed, but with low lipase activities. Furthermore, 2A peptide could successfully mediate the co-expression and secretion of lipase isozymes, but it seriously affected the expression of TLL downstream of 2A peptide.</p><p><strong> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> The low production level is one of the limitation factors for decreasing the prices of enzymes and expanding their application in industry as the biocatalysts. This research focuses on developing lipase isozyme co-expression strategies in Pichia pastoris to enhance the expression level of overall lipase isozymes which catalyse the same reaction. The Kex2-mediated co-expression strategy of lipase isozymes could potentially enhance the overall isozyme expression, and isozyme co-expression might provide a new direction for improving the recombinant isozyme expression, and decreasing the production and application prices of these mixed enzymes as biocatalysts.</p></details><hr><h4>Co-expression of alpha-1 antitrypsin with cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE in Pichia pastoris: preserving biological activity of alpha-1 antitrypsin.</h4><p>M.

Because of its extensive application in medicine, recombinant DNA technology has been considered for its production. The current study is going to examine co-expression of A1AT, and soluble domain of v-SNARE in Pichia pastoris, which can prevent the secretion of A1AT after passing the secretory pathway thoroughly. This was done mainly to preserve the biological activity of A1AT which in the secretory mode might be impaired in the fermentation and early clarification conditions. SNARE proteins are the driving force for vesicle docking and membrane fusion in the term defined as exocytosis. Intracellular expression of the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE and its subsequent interaction to form SNARE complex can intensify the competition for A1AT secretory vesicles to be fused and released to the media. Our investigation shows successful co-expression of A1AT in the form of post-Golgi vesicles (PGVs), and the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE. Our findings confirmed the reduction of A1AT secretion by 45% which trapped in post-Golgi A1AT secretory vesicles inside the cell were biologically more active than secreted A1AT protein. These results indicate that the inhibition of A1AT secretion can protect its biological activity in fermentation and clarification processes. This article is protected by copyright.

They are important nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products that are biosynthesized through the action of chondroitin sulfotransferases on either an unsulfated chondroitin or a dermatan polysaccharide precursor. While the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfates are well known, the cloning end expression of these membrane-bound Golgi enzymes continue to pose challenges. The major chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase, Homo sapiens C4ST-1, had been previously cloned and expressed from mammalian CHO, COS-7, and HEK 293 cells, and its activity was shown to require glycosylation. In the current study, a C4ST-1 construct was designed and expressed in both Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris in its non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms. Both constructs showed similar activity albeit different kinetic parameters when acting on a microbially prepared unsulfated chondroitin substrate. Moreover, the glycosylated form of C4ST-1 showed lower stability than the non-glycosylated form.</p></details><hr><h4>Towards systems metabolic engineering in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. P.

Already, a sizeable amount of systems biology knowledge has been acquired for this non-conventional yeast. By applying various omics-technologies, productivity features have been thoroughly analyzed and optimized via genetic engineering. However, challenging clonal variability, limited vector repertoire and insufficient genome annotation have hampered further developments. Yet, in the last few years a reinvigorated effort to establish P. pastoris as a host for both protein and metabolite production is visible. A variety of compounds from terpenoids to polyketides have been synthesized, often exceeding the productivity of other microbial systems. The clonal variability was systematically investigated and strategies formulated to circumvent untargeted events, thereby streamlining the screening procedure. Promoters with novel regulatory properties were discovered or engineered from existing ones. The genetic tractability was increased via the transfer of popular manipulation and assembly techniques, as well as the creation of new ones. A second generation of sequencing projects culminated in the creation of the second best functionally annotated yeast genome. In combination with landmark physiological insights and increased output of omics-data, a good basis for the creation of refined genome-scale metabolic models was created. The first application of model-based metabolic engineering in P. pastoris showcased the potential of this approach. Recent efforts to establish yeast peroxisomes for compartmentalized metabolite synthesis appear to fit ideally with the well-studied high capacity peroxisomal machinery of P. pastoris. Here, these recent developments are collected and reviewed with the aim of supporting the establishment of systems metabolic engineering in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of the antimyotoxic protein DM64 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

Interestingly, some animals are resistant to snake envenomation due to the presence of inhibitory glycoproteins in their serum that target toxic venom components. DM64 is an acidic glycoprotein isolated from Didelphis aurita (opossum) serum that has been characterized as an inhibitor of the myotoxicity induced by bothropic toxins bearing phospholipase A2 (PLA2) structures. This antitoxic protein can serve as an excellent starting template for the design of novel therapeutics against snakebite envenomation, particularly venom-induced local tissue damage. Therefore, the aim of this work was to produce a recombinant DM64 (rDM64) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and to compare its biological properties with those of native DM64. Yeast fermentation in the presence of Pefabloc, a serine protease inhibitor, stimulated cell growth (~1.5-fold), increased the rDM64 production yield approximately 10-fold and significantly reduced the susceptibility of rDM64 to proteolytic degradation. P. pastoris fermentation products were identified by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. The heterologous protein was efficiently purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography (with immobilized PLA2 myotoxin) and/or an ion exchange column. Although both native and recombinant DM64 exhibit different glycosylation patterns, they show very similar electrophoretic mobilities after PNGase F treatment. rDM64 formed a noncovalent complex with myotoxin II (Lys49-PLA2) from Bothrops asper and displayed biological activity that was similar to that of native DM64, inhibiting the cytotoxicity of myotoxin II by 92% at a 1:1 molar ratio.</p></details><hr><h4>High level expression of beta-mannanase (RmMan5A) in Pichia pastoris for partially hydrolyzed guar gum production.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, a novel beta-mannanase gene (RmMan5A) from Rhizomucor miehei was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and subjected for PHGG production. Enzyme activity of fermentation supernatant reached 85,200UmL-1 after 168h high cell density fermentation. The purified RmMan5A exhibited the highest enzyme activity at pH 7.0 and 65 degrees C. RmMan5A was then employed for guar gum hydrolysis and PHGG obtained demonstrated a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 2.5x104Da. Total dietary fiber accounted 90.6% of PHGG and 24.9% (w/w) of PHGG were identified as manno-oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization<7. PHGG was further fractionated (F1-F4) by gradual ethanol precipitation. PHGG F1 with an Mw value of 3.6x104Da and a mannose/galactose (M/G) ratio of 1.47 was precipitated initially, followed by PHGG F2 and F3 which showed lower Mw and higher M/G ratio. According to the structure analysis, the distribution of alpha-d-galactose of PHGG F1 was compact and regular, and that of other fractions was more random. A suitable beta-mannanase for PHGG production and some useful information of PHGG are provided in this paper.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering of Yersinia Phytases to Improve Pepsin and Trypsin Resistance and Thermostability and Application Potential in the Food and Feed Industry.</h4><p>C.

The predicted pepsin/trypsin cleavage sites F89/K226 in pepsin/trypsin-sensitive YeAPPA and the corresponding sites (F89/E226) in pepsin-sensitive but trypsin-resistant YkAPPA were substituted with S and H, respectively. Six variants were produced in Pichia pastoris for catalytic and biochemical characterization. F89S, E226H, and F89S/E226H elevated pepsin resistance and thermostability and K226H and F89S/K226H improved pepsin and trypsin resistance and stability at 60 degrees C and low pH. All the variants increased the ability of the proteins to hydrolyze phytate in corn meal by 2.6-14.9-fold in the presence of pepsin at 37 degrees C and low pH. This study developed a genetic manipulation strategy specific for pepsin/trypsin-sensitive phytases that can improve enzyme tolerance against proteases and heat and benefit the food and feed industry in a cost-effective way.</p></details><hr><h4>A step forward in laccase exploitation: Recombinant production and evaluation of techno-economic feasibility of the process.</h4><p>C.

The high redox potential laccase POXA1b from Pleurotus ostreatus was chosen as case study of marketable enzyme, due to its desirable properties in terms of activity/stability profile, and already assessed applicability. POXA1b was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris by investigating the effect of inducible and constitutive expression systems on both the yield and the cost of its production. System performances were first assessed in shaken-flasks and then scaled-up in bioreactor. The production level obtained in the inducible system is 42U/mL, while the activity value achieved with the constitutive one is 60U/mL, the highest obtained in constitutive systems so far. The economic feasibility of recombinant laccase production was simulated, describing the case of an Italian small-medium enterprise. Two scenarios were evaluated: Scenario (I) production based on methanol inducible system; Scenario (II) production based on the constitutive system, fed with glycerol. At all the scales the glycerol-based fermentation is more economic than the methanol-based one. The price forecast for rPOXA1b production is 0.34eurokU-1 for glycerol-based process, and is very competitive with the current price of commercial laccase.</p></details><hr><h4>Rapid expression and purification of the hepatitis delta virus antigen using the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

While the previously demonstrated inclined or lamellar settlers can be used for such perfusion bioreactors for microbial cells, the size and footprint requirements of such inefficiently scaled up devices can be quite large in comparison to the bioreactor size. Faced with this constraint, we have now developed novel, patent-pending compact cell settlers that can be used more efficiently with microbial perfusion bioreactors to achieve high cell densities and bioreactor productivities. Reproducible results from numerous month-long perfusion culture experiments using these devices attached to the 5 L perfusion bioreactor demonstrate very high cell densities due to substantial sedimentation of the larger live yeast cells which are returned to the bioreactor, while the harvest stream from the top of these cell settlers is a significantly clarified liquid, containing less than 30% and more typically less than 10% of the bioreactor cell concentration. Size of cells in the harvest is smaller than that of the cells in the bioreactor. Accumulated protein collected from the harvest and rate of protein accumulation is significantly (> 6x) higher than the protein produced in repeated fed-batch cultures over the same culture duration.

The purified recombinant lipase exhibited a specific activity of 130 U/mg toward p-nitrophenyl Laurate. Its optimum pH and temperature were 8.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. It was highly stable and even activated in water-miscible solvents, showing over 102% residual activity after 24 h incubation in ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and acetonitrile. In addition, the enzyme showed promoted activity with the increasing concentrations of methanol/ethanol and exhibited the maximum activity at 80%. In a solvent-free system for biodiesel synthesis with a one-step addition of methanol, the recombinant lipase displayed a 87% conversion rate toward palm oil at the high water content of 80%. The highly improved expression level and activity of the recombinant lipase may contribute to enable its commercial-scale production, and the unique properties would make it a particularly promising biocatalyst for biodiesel production in the future.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the hepcidin gene from roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus).</h4><p>Y.

Here, we report the molecular characterization and functional analysis of a novel hamp1 hepcidin isoforms Tf-Hep from roughskin sculpin, Trachidermus fasciatus. A cDNA fragment of 988 bp with an ORF of 273 bp was obtained. The coding sequence encodes for a signal peptide of 24 amino acids coupled with a prodomain of 40 amino acids and a mature peptide of 26 amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that Tf-Hep was most abundant in the liver. It could be significantly induced post lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and heavy metal exposure. The mature peptide was expressed as a 6.061 kDa fusion protein in Pichia pastoris GS115. The active purified recombinant protein (rTf-Hep) exhibited a wide spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity in vitro against 4 Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio Anguillarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus megaterium with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-80 mug/ml (0.825-13.2 muM). It also displayed high affinity to polysaccharides on bacteria surface including LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN). We further revealed that rTf-hep was capable of agglutinating 6 of the 8 bacteria. All these results suggest that rTf-hep may be both an antibacterial effector and a pattern recognition molecule in fish immune defense. The in vivo bacterial treatment results demonstrated that rTf-Hep could significantly improve the survival rate of fish infected with V. anguillarum. Taken together, these data indicate an important role for Tf-hep in the innate immunity of Trachidermus fasciatus and suggest its potential application in aquaculture for increasing fish resistance to disease.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel cystatin type 2 from Rhipicephalus microplus midgut.</h4><p>T.

Cattle vaccination is an alternative to control tick infestations, but the discovery of potential antigens is still a challenge for researchers. Recently, our group performed a midgut transcriptome of engorged R. microplus tick, and out of 800 ESTs sequences one cystatin-coding sequence was identified and named Rmcystatin-4. In order to understand the physiological role of Rmcystatin-4, the aim of this work was the expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel type 2 cystatin from the tick R. microplus. Rmcystatin-4 gene expression was identified mostly in tick midgut suggesting its possible role in blood digestion control. Our data showed that rRmcystatin-4 was successfully expressed in active form using Pichia pastoris system and the purified inhibitor presented high selectivity to BmCl-1 (Ki = 0.046 nM). Moreover, rRmcystatin-4 was able to impaired BmCl-1 activity towards bovine hemoglobin.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Bacillus amyloliquefaciens xylanase A expressed in Pichia pastoris and generation of xylooligosaccharides from xylans and wheat bran.</h4><p>M. Q. Liu, W. K. Huo, X. Xu, X. Y.

The recombinant xylanase, namely rePBaxA, was purified to homogeneity by using Ni-affinity resin and its molecular weight was 35.0kDa. The optimum temperature and pH of rePBaxA were 50 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The kinetic parameters Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of rePBaxA were 5.41mg/mL and 22.42mumol/min/mL, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that after 6h of hydrolysis, rePBaxA released xylose-xylohexaose (X1-X6) mixture from beechwood and birchwood xylan, with xylobiose (X2) and xylotriose (X3) as the major products, respectively. The hydrolyates from oat spelt, wheat bran insoluble xylan and pretreated wheat bran by rePBaxA included X2-X6, with X6 having the highest concentration. The mode of action analysis revealed that rePBaxA was an endo-acting xylanase with transglycosylation activity. X2 might be the minimum oligomer hydrolyzed by rePBaxA. The pretreated wheat bran and wheat bran insoluble xylan could be directly hydrolyzed by rePBaxA. This study provided a basis for using agricultural waste by-products as substrates for manufacting value-added probiotics, namely, xylooligosaccharides.</p></details><hr><h4>13 C metabolic flux profiling of Pichia pastoris grown in aerobic batch cultures on glucose revealed high relative anabolic use of TCA cycle and limited incorporation of provided precursors of branched-chain amino acids.</h4><p>M. Zhang et al., FEBS J 284 3100 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28731268>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Carbon metabolism of Crabtree-negative yeast Pichia pastoris was profiled using 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to delineate regulation during exponential growth and to study the import of two precursors for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, alpha-ketoisovalerate and alpha-ketobutyrate. Cells were grown in aerobic batch cultures containing (a) only glucose, (b) glucose along with the precursors, or (c) glucose and Val. The study provided the following new insights. First, 13 C flux ratio analyses of central metabolism reveal an unexpectedly high anaplerotic supply of the tricarboxylic acid cycle for a Crabtree-negative yeast, and show that a substantial fraction of glucose catabolism proceeds through the pentose phosphate pathway. A comparison with previous flux ratio analyses for batch cultures of Crabtree-negative Pichia stipitis and Crabtree-positive Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the overall regulation of central carbon metabolism in P. pastoris is intermediate in between P. stipitis and S. cerevisiae. Second, excess alpha-ketoisovalerate in the medium is not transported into the cytoplasm indicating that P. pastoris lacks a suitable transporter. In contrast, excess Val is efficiently taken up and largely fulfills demands for both Val and Leu for protein synthesis. Third, excess alpha-ketobutyrate is transported into the mitochondria for Ile biosynthesis. However, the import does not efficiently inhibit the synthesis of alpha-ketobutyrate from pyruvate indicating that P. pastoris has not been optimized evolutionarily to take full advantage of this carbon source. These findings have direct implications for preparing uniformly 2 H,13 C,15 N-labeled proteins containing protonated Ile, Val, and Leu methyl groups in P. pastoris for NMR-based structural biology.</p><p><strong> ENZYMES:</strong> Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (EC 1.1.1.86), branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT, EC 2.6.1.42), fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2), malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39/1.1.1.40), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), l-serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1), threonine aldolase (EC 4.1.2.5), threonine dehydratase (EC 4.3.1.19); transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1), transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2).</p></details><hr><h4>Genetic Engineering of Native Chain Combinations of B-Cell Repertoires on the Surface of Methylotrophic Yeasts Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>T.

Infection by the fungal endophytes often confers biotic and abiotic stress tolerance to their hosts. Endophyte-mediated disease resistance is well-established in the fine fescue grass Festuca rubra subsp. rubra (strong creeping red fescue) infected with E. festucae. Resistance to fungal pathogens is not an established effect of endophyte infection of other grass species, and may therefore be unique to the fine fescues. The underlying mechanism of the disease resistance is unknown. E. festucae produces a secreted antifungal protein that is highly expressed in the infected plant tissues and may therefore be involved in the disease resistance. Most Epichloe spp. do not have a gene for a similar antifungal protein. Here we report the characterization of the E. festucae antifungal protein, designated Efe-AfpA. The antifungal protein partially purified from the apoplastic proteins of endophyte-infected plant tissue and the recombinant protein expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris was found to have activity against the important plant pathogen Sclerotinia homoeocarpa. Efe-AfpA may therefore be a component of the disease resistance seen in endophyte-infected strong creeping red fescue.</p></details><hr><h4>Cofactor engineering improved CALB production in Pichia pastoris through heterologous expression of NADH oxidase and adenylate kinase.</h4><p>C.

To study the effect of cofactor regeneration on recombinant protein expression, NADH oxidase (noxE) was engineered in P. pastoris expressing lipase B (GSCALB). Expression of noxE in P. pastoris (GSCALBNOX) increased NAD+ levels by 85% with a concomitant reduction in NADH/NAD+ ratio of 67% compared to GSCALB. The change in the redox level positively influenced the methanol uptake rate and made 34% augment in CALB activity. The decline in NADH level (44%) by noxE expression had lowered the adenylate energy charge (AEC) and ATP level in GSCALBNOX. In order to regenerate ATP in GSCALBNOX, adenylate kinase (ADK1) gene from S. cerevisiae S288c was co-expressed. Expression of ADK1 showed a remarkable increase in AEC and co-expression of both the genes synergistically improved CALB activity. This study shows the importance of maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and adenylate energy charge during recombinant CALB expression in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression and purification of a molluskan endoglucanase from Ampullaria crossean in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

A bioactive EG27I with a molecular weight of 27 kDa was successfully expressed and secreted into our culture medium. The respective final OD600 and hydrolytic activity were 333 and 1.28 U/mL when high-cell-density fermentation of the recombinant P. pastoris was performed in a 7.5 L fermenter through a fed-batch strategy for 132 h. The recombinant protein concentration of the fermentation supernatant was 47.7 mg/L. EG27I was consecutively purified from the fermentation supernatant through ultrafiltration, cation exchange, and hydrophobic interaction. The specific activity of the recombinant EG27I was 26.8 U/mg, and the optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme were 5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The half-life of the enzyme activity at 100 degrees C could reach 40 min.

In most cases macromolecules with multiple subunits are purified from endogenous sources. In this study, an endogenous membrane-protein complex was obtained from Pichia pastoris, which can be grown at high densities to significantly improve the membrane protein yield. We successfully isolated the membrane-bound Vo complex of V-ATPase from P. pastoris using a fusion FLAG tag attached to the C-terminus of subunit a to generate the vph-tag strain, which was used for dissociation and purification. After FLAG affinity and size exclusion chromatography purification, the production quantity and purity of the membrane-bound Vo complex was 20 mug l-1 and >98%, respectively. The subunits of the endogenous membrane-bound Vo complex observed in P. pastoris were similar to those obtained from S. cerevisiae, as demonstrated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Therefore, successful dissociation and purification of the membrane-bound Vo complex at a high purity and sufficient quantity was achieved via a rapid and simple procedure that can be used to obtain the endogenous membrane-protein complexes from P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Yeast-expressed recombinant As16 protects mice against Ascaris suum infection through induction of a Th2-skewed immune response.</h4><p>J.

As an alternative or complementary approach to global deworming, a pan-anthelminthic vaccine is under development targeting Ascaris, hookworm, and Trichuris infections. As16 and As14 have previously been described as two genetically related proteins from Ascaris suum that induced protective immunity in mice when formulated with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) as an adjuvant, but the exact protective mechanism was not well understood. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> As16 and As14 were highly expressed as soluble recombinant proteins (rAs16 and rAs14) in Pichia pastoris. The yeast-expressed rAs16 was highly recognized by immune sera from mice infected with A. suum eggs and elicited 99.6% protection against A. suum re-infection. Mice immunized with rAs16 formulated with ISA720 displayed significant larva reduction (36.7%) and stunted larval development against A. suum eggs challenge. The protective immunity was associated with a predominant Th2-type response characterized by high titers of serological IgG1 (IgG1/IgG2a > 2000) and high levels of IL-4 and IL-5 produced by restimulated splenocytes. A similar level of protection was observed in mice immunized with rAs16 formulated with alum (Alhydrogel), known to induce mainly a Th2-type immune response, whereas mice immunized with rAs16 formulated with MPLA or AddaVax, both known to induce a Th1-type biased response, were not significantly protected against A. suum infection. The rAs14 protein was not recognized by A. suum infected mouse sera and mice immunized with rAs14 formulated with ISA720 did not show significant protection against challenge infection, possibly due to the protein's inaccessibility to the host immune system or a Th1-type response was induced which would counter a protective Th2-type response. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Yeast-expressed rAs16 formulated with ISA720 or alum induced significant protection in mice against A. suum egg challenge that associates with a Th2-skewed immune response, suggesting that rAS16 could be a feasible vaccine candidate against ascariasis.</p></details><hr><h4>Methionine synthase is localized to the nucleus in Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans and to the cytoplasm in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</h4><p>U.

Here, we report that MS is localized to the nucleus of Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans but is cytoplasmic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae The P. pastoris strain carrying a deletion of the MET6 gene encoding MS (Ppmet6) exhibits methionine as well as adenine auxotrophy indicating that MS is required for methionine as well as adenine biosynthesis. Nuclear localization of P. pastoris MS (PpMS) was abrogated by the deletion of 107 C-terminal amino acids or the R742A mutation. In silico analysis of the PpMS structure indicated that PpMS may exist in a dimer-like configuration in which Arg-742 of a monomer forms a salt bridge with Asp-113 of another monomer. Biochemical studies indicate that R742A as well as D113R mutations abrogate nuclear localization of PpMS and its ability to reverse methionine auxotrophy of Ppmet6 Thus, association of two PpMS monomers through the interaction of Arg-742 and Asp-113 is essential for catalytic activity and nuclear localization. When PpMS is targeted to the cytoplasm employing a heterologous nuclear export signal, it is expressed at very low levels and is unable to reverse methionine and adenine auxotrophy of Ppmet6 Thus, nuclear localization is essential for the stability and function of MS in P. pastoris. We conclude that nuclear localization of MS is a unique feature of respiratory yeasts such as P. pastoris and C. albicans, and it may have novel moonlighting functions in the nucleus.</p></details><hr><h4>Constitutive expression of human gastric lipase in Pichia pastoris and site-directed mutagenesis of key lid-stabilizing residues.</h4><p>L.

The HGL signal peptide was replaced by the yeast alpha-factor to achieve an efficient secretion. Active rHGL was produced by the transformed yeast but its levels and stability were dependent on the pH. The highest activity was obtained upon buffering the culture medium at pH5, a condition that allowed preserving enzyme activity over time. A large fraction (72+/-2%) of secreted rHGL remained however bound to the yeast cells, and was released by washing the cell pellet with an acid glycine-HCl buffer (pH2.2). This procedure allowed establishing a first step of purification that was completed by size exclusion chromatography. N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry revealed that rHGL was produced in its mature form, with a global mass of 50,837+/-32Da corresponding to a N-glycosylated form of HGL polypeptide (43,193Da). rHGL activity was characterized as a function of pH, various substrates and in the presence of bile salts and pepsin, and was found similar to native HGL, except for slight changes in pH optima. We then studied by site-directed mutagenesis the role of three key residues (K4, E225, R229) involved in salt bridges stabilizing the lid domain that controls the access to the active site and is part of the interfacial recognition site. Their substitution has an impact on the pH-dependent activity of rHGL and its relative activities on medium and long chain triglycerides.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a recombinant xylose tolerant beta-xylosidase from Humicola grisea var. thermoidea and its use in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysis.</h4><p>L.

An optimization of enzyme production was carried out, and methanol was found to be the most important parameter. The purified enzyme was characterized and showed the optimal conditions for the highest activity at pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, being thermostable by maintaining 41% of its activity after 12h incubated at 50 degrees C. HXYLA is a bifunctional enzyme; it showed both beta-xylosidase and alpha-arabinfuranosidase activities. The Km and Vmax values were 1.3mM and 39.1U/mg, respectively, against 4-nitrophenyl beta-xylopyranoside. HXYLA showed a relatively strong tolerance to xylose with high Ki value of 603mM, with the xylose being a non-competitive inhibitor. HXYLA was successfully used simultaneously and sequentially with an endo-xylanase for analysis of synergism in the degradation of commercial xylans. Furthermore, commercial cellulases supplementation with HXYLA during sugarcane bagasse hydrolysis increased hydrolysis in 29%. HXYLA is distinguished from other beta-xylosidases by the attractive characteristics for industrial applications such as thermostability, high tolerance xylose and saccharification of biomass by convert xylan into fementable monosaccharides and improve cellulose hydrolysis.</p></details><hr><h4>Biomarkers allow detection of nutrient limitations and respective supplementation for elimination in Pichia pastoris fed-batch cultures.</h4><p>J.

During a common P. pastoris fed-batch process, cells experience strong adaptations to different metabolic states or suffer from environmental stresses due to high cell density cultivation. Additionally, recombinant protein production and nutrient limitations are challenging in these processes.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Pichia pastoris producing porcine carboxypeptidase B (CpB) was cultivated in glucose or methanol-limited fed-batch mode, and the cellular response was analyzed using microarrays. Thereby, strong transcriptional regulations in transport-, regulatory- and metabolic processes connected to sulfur, phosphorus and nitrogen metabolism became obvious. The induction of these genes was observed in both glucose- and methanol- limited fed batch cultivations, but were stronger in the latter condition. As the transcriptional pattern was indicative for nutrient limitations, we performed fed-batch cultivations where we added the respective nutrients and compared them to non-supplemented cultures regarding cell growth, productivity and expression levels of selected biomarker genes. In the non-supplemented reference cultures we observed a strong increase in transcript levels of up to 89-fold for phosphorus limitation marker genes in the late fed-batch phase. Transcript levels of sulfur limitation marker genes were up to 35-fold increased. By addition of (NH4)2SO4 or (NH4)2HPO4, respectively, we were able to suppress the transcriptional response of the marker genes to levels initially observed at the start of the fed batch. Additionally, supplementation had also a positive impact on biomass generation and recombinant protein production. Supplementation with (NH4)2SO4 led to 5% increase in biomass and 52% higher CpB activity in the supernatant, compared to the non-supplemented reference cultivations. In (NH4)2HPO4 supplemented cultures 9% higher biomass concentrations and 60% more CpB activity were reached.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Transcriptional analysis of P. pastoris fed-batch cultivations led to the identification of nutrient limitations in the later phases, and respective biomarker genes for indication of limitations. Supplementation of the cultivation media with those nutrients eliminated the limitations on the transcriptional level, and was also shown to enhance productivity of a recombinant protein. The biomarker genes are versatily applicable to media and process optimization approaches, where tailor-made solutions are envisioned.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparison of fully wettable RPLC stationary phases for LC-MS-based cellular metabolomics.</h4><p>L.

Due to the difficulties in analyzing a wide range of polarities encountered in the metabolome, 100%-wettable reversed-phase materials are frequently used to maximize metabolome coverage within a single analysis. Packed with silica-based sub-3 mum diameter particles, these columns allow high separation efficiency and offer a reasonable compromise for metabolome coverage within a single analysis. While direct performance comparison can be made using classical chromatographic characterization approaches, a comprehensive assessment of the column's performance for cellular metabolomics requires use of a full LC-HRMS workflow in order to reflect realistic study conditions used for cellular metabolomics. In this study, a comparison of several reversed-phase LC columns for metabolome analysis using such a dedicated workflow is presented. All columns were tested under the same analytical conditions on an LC-TOF-MS platform using a variety of authentic metabolite standards and biotechnologically relevant yeast cell extracts. Data on total workflow performance including retention behavior, peak capacity, coverage, and molecular feature extraction repeatability from these columns are presented with consideration for both nontargeted screening and differential metabolomics workflows using authentic standards and Pichia pastoris cell extract samples.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolic modeling to identify engineering targets for Komagataella phaffii: The effect of biomass composition on gene target identification.</h4><p>A.

Pichia pastoris). However, as is the case for many industrial microbes, there is no executable metabolic model for K. phaffiii that confirms to current standards by providing the metabolite and reactions IDs, to facilitate model extension and reuse, and gene-reaction associations to enable identification of targets for genetic manipulation. In order to remedy this deficiency, we decided to reconstruct the genome-scale metabolic model of K. phaffii by reconciling the extant models and performing extensive manual curation in order to construct an executable model (Kp.1.0) that conforms to current standards. We then used this model to study the effect of biomass composition on the predictive success of the model. Twelve different biomass compositions obtained from published empirical data obtained under a range of growth conditions were employed in this investigation. We found that the success of Kp1.0 in predicting both gene essentiality and growth characteristics was relatively unaffected by biomass composition. However, we found that biomass composition had a profound effect on the distribution of the fluxes involved in lipid, DNA, and steroid biosynthetic processes, cellular alcohol metabolic process, and oxidation-reduction process. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of biomass composition on the identification of suitable target genes for strain development. The analyses revealed that around 40% of the predictions of the effect of gene overexpression or deletion changed depending on the representation of biomass composition in the model. Considering the robustness of the in silico flux distributions to the changing biomass representations enables better interpretation of experimental results, reduces the risk of wrong target identification, and so both speeds and improves the process of directed strain development.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancing expression of the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein E in yeast and its application in an indirect sandwich ELISA.</h4><p>C.

HoXyn11B was partly N-glycosylated and appeared two protein bands (19-29 kDa) on SDS-PAGE. The recombinant enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 4.5 and 55 degrees C, and retained more than 90% of the original activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for 60 min. The determined apparent K m and V max values using beechwood xylan were 10.43 mg/ml and 3246.75 IU/mg, respectively. The modes of action of recombinant HoXyn11B on xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs) and beechwood xylan were investigated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), which indicated that the modes of action of HoXyn11B are different from HoXyn11A since it is able to release a significant amount of xylose from various substrates. This study provides an opportunity to better understand the hydrolysis mechanisms of xylan by xylanases from Trichoderma.</p></details><hr><h4>Application and comparison in biosynthesis and biodegradation by Fusarium solani and Aspergillus fumigatus cutinases.</h4><p>L.

The characteristics of these two cutinases were investigated and compared. The results indicated that F. solani and A. fumigatus cutinases hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl substrates with different carbon chain lengths. A. fumigatus cutinase predominately hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl butyrate, but F. solani cutinase preferred p-nitrophenyl decanoate. The abilities of polymer synthesis and bioplastic degradation were tested and compared between F. solani and A. fumigatus cutinases. The results showed that F. solani cutinase had degradation ability on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and synthesized polymer with a molecular weight (MW) of 2300 in organic solvent. However, A. fumigatus cutinase completely degraded PCL and synthesized molecules with a MW of 25,000, suggesting that A. fumigatus cutinase has more promising applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning, expression and functional characterization of a D-superfamily conotoxin Lt28.1 with previously undescribed cysteine pattern.</h4><p>J.

According to the conserved signal peptides of D-conotoxins, seven D-conotoxin precursor sequences with a previously undescribed Cys arrangement (-C-C-C-CC-C-C-C-C-C-) were identified by PCR-RACE methodology in the present study. The alignment of sequences revealed that signal peptide regions were same as D-VxXXA from Conus vexillum, and their mature peptides were almost different from the D-conotoxins. Analyses of the evolutionary tree demonstrated that they had low homology to those reported conotoxins with 10 cysteine residues (less than 35%) and lied in a separate branch in the evolutionary tree. Furthermore, a previously undescribed D-superfamily conotoxin Lt28.1 was further expressed in Pichia pastoris and then functionally characterized. The results showed that the recombinant Lt28.1 targeted alpha9alpha10 nAChRs but not other nAChRs subtypes. These findings defined a new branch of D-superfamily and expanded our knowledge of targets and potential application of D-conotoxins.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and functional analysis of new peroxygenases in oat.</h4><p>I. Benaragama, D. Meesapyodsuk, A. D. Beattie, X. Qiu, Planta   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664421>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>MAIN CONCLUSION:</strong> Two new peroxygenases for the biosynthesis of epoxy fatty acids in oat were identified and functionally analyzed by heterologous expression along with rationally designed site-directed mutagenesis. Oat (Avena sativa L.) contains a large family of peroxygenases, a group of heme-containing monooxygenases catalyzing hydroperoxide-dependent epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Here, we report identification and functional analysis of two new peroxygenases AsPXG2 and AsPXG3 from oat. The open reading frame (ORF) of AsPXG2 contains 702 bps encoding a polypeptide of 233 amino acids, while the ORF of AsPXG3 is 627 bps coding for 208 amino acids. Both AsPXG2 and AsPXG3 comprise a single transmembrane domain, conserved histidines for heme binding and a conserved EF-hand motif for calcium binding, but they only share about 50% amino acid sequence identity with each other. When expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, AsPXG3 showed high epoxidation activity, while AsPXG2 exhibited no activity in E. coli and low activity in P. pastoris. AsPXG3 could effectively epoxidize both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids with linolenic acid being the most preferred substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to investigate the structure-function relationship of oat peroxygenase on 12 conserved residues of AsPXG3. Replacement of two conserved histidines, the ligands to the prosthetic heme group of the peroxygenase, by alanine resulted in complete loss of activity. Substitution of three conserved residues surrounding the two histidines resulted in reduction of the enzymatic activity by more than 80%. These results imply that these conserved residues might be located in or near the catalytic pocket, where the two histidine residues coordinate the heme group and the surrounding residues define the shape and size of the pocket for interaction with the heme as well as two substrates.</p></details><hr><h4>Yeast lysates carrying the nucleoprotein from measles virus vaccine as a novel subunit vaccine platform to deliver Plasmodium circumsporozoite antigen.</h4><p>D.

In addition, delivery of vaccine antigens directly within heat-inactivated yeast cells is attractive due to the adjuvancy provided by the yeast cell. In this study, Pichia pastoris yeast lysates carrying the nucleoprotein (N) from the measles vaccine virus were evaluated as a novel subunit vaccine platform to deliver the circumsporozoite surface antigen (CS) of Plasmodium. When expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast, the N protein auto-assembles into highly multimeric ribonucleoparticles (RNPs). The CS antigen from Plasmodium berghei (PbCS) was expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast in fusion with N, generating recombinant PbCS-carrying RNPs in the cytoplasm of yeast cells.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> When evaluated in mice after 3-5 weekly subcutaneous injections, yeast lysates containing N-PbCS RNPs elicited strong anti-PbCS humoral responses, which were PbCS-dose dependent and reached a plateau by the pre-challenge time point. Protective efficacy of yeast lysates was dose-dependent, although anti-PbCS antibody titers were not predictive of protection. Multimerization of PbCS on RNPs was essential for providing benefit against infection, as immunization with monomeric PbCS delivered in yeast lysates was not protective. Three weekly injections with N-PbCS yeast lysates in combination with alum adjuvant produced sterile protection in two out of six mice, and significantly reduced parasitaemia in the other individuals from the same group. This parasitaemia decrease was of the same extent as in mice immunized with non-adjuvanted N-PbCS yeast lysates, providing evidence that the yeast lysate formulation did not require accessory adjuvants for eliciting efficient parasitaemia reduction.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study demonstrates that yeast lysates are an attractive auto-adjuvant and efficient platform for delivering multimeric PbCS on measles N-based RNPs. By combining yeast lysates that carry RNPs with a large panel of Plasmodium antigens, this technology could be applied to developing a multivalent vaccine against malaria.</p></details><hr><h4>Pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into the Ligand Environment of Copper in Drosophila Lysyl Oxidase.</h4><p>G.

Despite its important biological functions, the structure of human LOX remains unknown (unlike that of an unrelated LOX, from Pichia pastoris). Here, we expressed active LOX from Drosophila melanogaster, DmLOXL1, a close homologue of human LOX, and characterized it by MS, UV-vis, activity, and inhibition assays. We then used bioinformatics, electron paramagnetic resonance, electron spin-echo envelope modulation, and hyperfine sublevel-correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopies to probe Cu-ligand bonding finding direct evidence for pH-dependent Cu-His interactions. At pH = 9.3, the spectroscopic data indicated primarily a single His bound to Cu, but at pH = 7.5, there was evidence for a approximately 1:1 mixture of species containing 1 and 3 His ligands. We then used HYSCORE to probe possible interactions between the LOX inhibitor BAPN (beta-aminopropionitrile; 1-[13C15N]cyano-2-aminoethane) and the copper center-finding none. Overall, the results are of interest since they provide new spectroscopic information about the nature of the catalytic site in LOX, an important anticancer drug target.</p></details><hr><h4>Accurate analysis of fusion expression of Pichia pastoris glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified cell wall proteins.</h4><p>P.

The GPI-modified cell wall proteins GCW21, GCW51, and GCW61 of Pichia pastoris were chosen as anchoring proteins to construct co-expression strains in P. pastoris GS115. The hydrolytic activity and the amount of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) displayed on cell surface increased significantly following optimization of the fusion gene dosage and combination of the homogeneous or heterogeneous cell wall proteins. Maximum CALB hydrolytic activity was achieved at 4920 U/g dry cell weight in strain GS115/CALB-GCW (51 + 51 + 61 + 61) after 120 h of methanol induction. Changes in structural morphology and the properties of the cell surfaces caused by co-expression of fusion proteins were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and on plates containing cell-wall-destabilizing reagent. Our results suggested that both the outer and inner cell layers were significantly altered by overexpression of GPI-modified cell wall proteins. Interestingly, quantitative analysis of the inner layer components showed an increase in beta-1,3-glucan, but no obvious changes in chitin in the strains overexpressing GPI-modified cell wall proteins.</p></details><hr><h4>Deleting the first disulphide bond in an arenicin derivative enhances its expression in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>N. Yang et al., Lett Appl Microbiol 65 241 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28656630>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The marine antimicrobial peptide NZ17074, a variant of arenicin-3 from Arenicola marina that has broad antimicrobial activity and high bioavailability, can be designed to treat bacterial and fungal diseases. To reduce the toxicity of NZ17074, N6 was designed by replacing a cysteine in positions 3 and 20 with alanine, fused to the C-terminus of the small ubiquitin-like modifier tag (SUMO), and expressed in yeast. SUMO-N6 yielded as much as 921 mg l-1 at 72 h after induction in a fermentor and increased 1.8-fold over SUMO-NZ17074. After cleavage with 30% formic acid and purification by a Sephadex G-25 column, 9.7 mg of the recombinant peptide N6 (rN6) was obtained from one-litre fermentation broth, increasing 1.4-fold over NZ17074. Compared to NZ17074, rN6 displayed almost identical antimicrobial activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.5, 0.25-0.5, 4, 0.25-16 and 16 mug ml-1 against Escherichia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains. Our results indicate that the first disulphide bond, Cys3-Cys20, in NZ17074 is not necessary for antimicrobial activity and that its deletion might reduce toxicity to host cells. These findings may help design new antimicrobial peptides harbouring fewer disulphide bridges and may have more potent activity.</p><p><strong> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> Disulphide bond formation is an important step in the protein expression and can also influence protein secretion. A deletion of the first disulphide bond in NZ17074 increased the secreted level of target protein, and its antimicrobial activity was almost unaffected by the deletion of the first disulphide bond. The first disulphide bond in NZ17074 is favourable for correctly forming another disulphide bond during expression but not necessary for its activity. This may help design and produce a novel class of antimicrobial peptides harbouring fewer disulphide bridges to save the cost.</p></details><hr><h4>Variants of PpuLcc, a multi-dye decolorizing laccase from Pleurotus pulmonarius expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

The PpuLcc was purified from the culture supernatant via FPLC, and the corresponding gene cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. To examine the impact of the C-terminal tail region and the signal peptide on the recombinant expression of PpuLcc, a non-modified version or different truncations (-2, -5, -13 AA) of the target protein were combined with different secretion signals. Heterologous expression of codon optimized constructs resulted in extracellular activities of the PpuLcc variants of up to 7000 U L-1 (substrate ABTS) which was six times higher than non-codon optimized constructs. In contrast to previous works, altering the C-terminal end of the protein did not influence kinetic parameters or the rate of expression. The His-Tag purified enzymes showed high temperature optima (50-70 degrees C) and thermo stability. All of the recombinant variants degraded triarylmethane and azo dyes. Rapid bleaching of beta-carotene (E 160a) and the polyene acid norbixin (E 160b) using a laccase was found for the first time. Thus, the enzyme may be useful in decolorizing unwanted polyene pigments, for example from the processing of cheese, bakery, desserts, ice cream or coloured casings.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and biochemical characterization of the unmodified sulfatase from Fusarium proliferatum LE1.</h4><p>S.

To date, despite the discovery of many sulfatase genes and the accumulation of data on numerous sulfated molecules, the number of characterized enzymes that are key players in sulfur metabolism remains extremely limited. While mammalian sulfatases are well studied due to their involvement in a wide range of normal and pathological biological processes, lower eukaryotic sulfatases, especially fungal sulfatases, have not been thoroughly investigated at the biochemical and structural level. In this paper, we describe the molecular cloning of Fusarium proliferatum sulfatase (F.p.Sulf-6His), its recombinant expression in Pichia pastoris as a soluble and active cytosolic enzyme and its detailed characterization. Gel filtration and native electrophoretic experiments showed that this recombinant enzyme exists as a tetramer in solution. The enzyme is thermo-sensitive, with an optimal temperature of 25 degrees C. The optimal pH value for the hydrolysis of sulfate esters and stability of the enzyme was 6.0. Despite the absence of the post-translational modification of cysteine into Calpha-formylglycine, the recombinant F.p.Sulf-6His has remarkably stable catalytic activity against p-nitrophenol sulfate, with kcat = 0.28 s-1 and Km = 2.45 mM, which indicates potential use in the desulfating processes. The currently proposed enzymatic mechanisms of sulfate ester hydrolysis do not explain the appearance of catalytic activity for the unmodified enzyme. According to the available models, the unmodified enzyme is not able to perform multiple catalytic acts; therefore, the enzymatic mechanism of sulfate esters hydrolysis remains to be fully elucidated.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcriptional engineering of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter for improved heterologous protein production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

We constructed a synthetic library with distinct regulatory properties through deletion and duplication of these putative transcription factor binding sites and selected transcription factor (TF) genes were overexpressed or deleted to understand their roles on heterologous protein production. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein, an expression strength in a range between 0.35- and 3.10-fold of the wild-type PGAP was obtained. Another model protein, recombinant human growth hormone was produced under control of selected promoter variants and 1.6- to 2.4-fold higher product titers were reached compared to wild-type PGAP . In addition, a GAL4-like TF was found to be a crucial factor for the regulation of PGAP , and its overexpression enhanced the heterologous protein production considerably (up to 2.2-fold compared to the parental strain). The synthetic PGAP library generated enabled us to investigate the different putative transcription factors which are responsible for the regulation of PGAP under different growth conditions, ergo recombinant protein production under PGAP .

Aqy1, which is a water transporting aquaporin of the yeast Pichia pastoris, is suggested to be gated by chemo-mechanical stimuli as a protective regulatory-response against rapid freezing. Here, we tested the influence of temperature by determining the X-ray structure of Aqy1 at room temperature (RT) at 1.3 A resolution, and by exploring the structural dynamics of Aqy1 during freezing through molecular dynamics simulations. At ambient temperature and in a lipid bilayer, Aqy1 adopts a closed conformation that is globally better described by the RT than by the low-temperature (LT) crystal structure. Locally, for the blocking-residue Tyr31 and the water molecules inside the pore, both LT and RT data sets are consistent with the positions observed in the simulations at room-temperature. Moreover, as the temperature was lowered, Tyr31 adopted a conformation that more effectively blocked the channel, and its motion was accompanied by a temperature-driven rearrangement of the water molecules inside the channel. We therefore speculate that temperature drives Aqy1 from a loosely- to a tightly-blocked state. This analysis provides high-resolution structural evidence of the influence of temperature on membrane-transport channels.</p></details><hr><h4>Disease-linked mutations in factor H reveal pivotal role of cofactor activity in self-surface-selective regulation of complement activation.</h4><p>H. Kerr et al., J Biol Chem 292 13345 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637873>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Spontaneous activation enables the complement system to respond very rapidly to diverse threats. This activation is efficiently suppressed by complement factor H (CFH) on self-surfaces but not on foreign surfaces. The surface selectivity of CFH, a soluble protein containing 20 complement-control protein modules (CCPs 1-20), may be compromised by disease-linked mutations. However, which of the several functions of CFH drives this self-surface selectivity remains unknown. To address this, we expressed human CFH mutants in Pichia pastoris We found that recombinant I62-CFH (protective against age-related macular degeneration) and V62-CFH functioned equivalently, matching or outperforming plasma-derived CFH, whereas R53H-CFH, linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), was defective in C3bBb decay-accelerating activity (DAA) and factor I cofactor activity (CA). The aHUS-linked CCP 19 mutant D1119G-CFH had virtually no CA on (self-like) sheep erythrocytes (ES) but retained DAA. The aHUS-linked CCP 20 mutant S1191L/V1197A-CFH (LA-CFH) had dramatically reduced CA on ES but was less compromised in DAA. D1119G-CFH and LA-CFH both performed poorly at preventing complement-mediated hemolysis of ES PspCN, a CFH-binding Streptococcus pneumoniae protein domain, binds CFH tightly and increases accessibility of CCPs 19 and 20. PspCN did not improve the DAA of any CFH variant on ES Conversely, PspCN boosted the CA, on ES, of I62-CFH, R53H-CFH, and LA-CFH and also enhanced hemolysis protection by I62-CFH and LA-CFH. We conclude that CCPs 19 and 20 are critical for efficient CA on self-surfaces but less important for DAA. Exposing CCPs 19 and 20 with PspCN and thus enhancing CA on self-surfaces may reverse deficiencies of some CFH variants.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancement of thermoalkaliphilic xylanase production by Pichia pastoris through novel fed-batch strategy in high cell-density fermentation.</h4><p>T.

Investigation of nutritional fermentation parameters, non-nutritional fermentation parameters and feeding strategies in 1 L bioreactor and 1 L shake flask revealed that glycerol and methanol feeding strategies were the critical factors for high cell density and xylanase activity. In 50 L bioreactor, a novel glycerol feeding strategy and a four-stage methanol feeding strategy with a stepwise increase in feeding rate were developed to enhance recombinant xylanase production. In the initial 72 h of methanol induction, the linear dependence of xylanase activity on methanol intake was observed (R2 = 0.9726). The maximum xylanase activity was predicted to be 591.2 U/mL, while the actual maximum xylanase activity was 560.7 U/mL, which was 7.05 times of that in shake flask. Recombinant xylanase retained 82.5% of its initial activity after pre-incubation at 80 degrees C for 50 min (pH 8.0), and it exhibited excellent stability in the broad temperature (60-80 degrees C) and pH (pH 8.0-11.0) ranges.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Efficient glycerol and methanol fed-batch strategies resulting in desired cell density and xylanase activity should be applied in other P. pastoris fermentation for other recombinant proteins production. Recombinant xylanases with high pH- and thermal-stability showed potential in various industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Microscale disruption of microorganisms for parallelized process development.</h4><p>C.

Typically, products overexpressed E. coli and S. cerevisiae remain in the cytosol or are secreted into the periplasm. Consequently, efficient cell disruption is essential for high product recovery during microbial production. Process development platforms at microscale are essential to shorten time to market. While high-pressure homogenization is the industry standard for cell disruption at large scale this method is not practicable for experiments in microscale. This review describes microscale methods for cell disruption at scales as low as 200 microL. Strategies for automation, parallelization and miniaturization, as well as comparability of the results at this scale to high pressure homogenization are considered as those criteria decide which methods are most suited for scale down. Those aspects are discussed in detail for protein overexpression in E. coli and yeast but also the relevance for alternative products and host such as microalgae are taken into account. The authors conclude that bead milling is the best comparable microscale method to large scale high-pressure homogenization and therefore the most suitable technique for automated process development of microbial hosts with the exception of pDNA production.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical and structural characterization of Penicillium purpurogenum alpha-D galactosidase: Binding of galactose to an alternative pocket may explain enzyme inhibition.</h4><p>L.

The alpha-D-galactosidase is one of the enzymes which may act on pectin degradation. This enzyme has several biotechnological and medical applications. The aim of this work was to better understand the molecular mechanism of alpha-D-galactosidase from P. purpurogenum (GALP1). For this purpose, a gene coding for the enzyme was identified from the fungal genome and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 27. The protein of 435 amino acids has an optimum pH and temperature for activity of 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The KM for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (GalalphapNP) is 0.138 mM. The enzyme is inhibited by GalalphapNP at concentrations higher than 1 mM, and by the product galactose. A kinetic analysis of product inhibition shows that it is of mixed type, suggesting the presence of an additional binding site in the enzyme. To confirm this hypothesis, a structural model for GALP1 was built by comparative modelling methodology, which was validated and refined by molecular dynamics simulation. The data suggest that galactose may bind to an enzyme alternative pocket promoting structural changes of the active site, thus explaining its inhibitory effect. In silico site-directed mutagenesis experiments highlighted key residues involved in the maintenance of the alternative binding site, and their mutations for Ala predict the formation of proteins which should not be inhibited by galactose.

However, their application is limited by high cost and small scale of the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generally used to obtain sufficient amounts of DNA effective against epidemic diseases. In this study, a two-step, large-scale PCR was established using a low-cost DNA polymerase, RKOD, expressed in Pichia pastoris. Two linear DNA vaccines encoding influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) 1, LEC-HA, and PTO-LEC-HA (with phosphorothioate-modified primers), were produced by the two-step PCR. Protective effects of the vaccines were evaluated in a mouse model. BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the vaccines or a control DNA fragment. All immunized animals were challenged by intranasal administration of a lethal dose of influenza H1N1 virus 2 weeks after the last immunization. Sera of the immunized animals were tested for the presence of HA-specific antibodies, and the total IFN-gamma responses induced by linear DNA vaccines were measured. The results showed that the DNA vaccines but not the control DNA induced strong antibody and IFN-gamma responses. Additionally, the PTO-LEC-HA vaccine effectively protected the mice against the lethal homologous mouse-adapted virus, with a survival rate of 100% versus 70% in the LEC-HA-vaccinated group, showing that the PTO-LEC-HA vaccine was more effective than LEC-HA. In conclusion, the results indicated that the linear H1N1 HA-coding DNA vaccines induced significant immune responses and protected mice against a lethal virus challenge. Thus, the low-cost, two-step, large-scale PCR can be considered a potential tool for rapid manufacturing of linear DNA vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Auto-induction of Pichia pastoris AOX1 promoter for membrane protein expression.</h4><p>J. Y. Lee et al., Protein Expr Purif 137 7 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619526>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a highly successful recombinant protein expression system due to its ability to quickly generate large quantities of recombinant proteins in simple media. P. pastoris has been used to successfully generate milligram quantities of many important human membrane proteins, including G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, and transporters, which are becoming increasingly important therapeutic targets. Despite these successes, protein expression in P. pastoris is still cumbersome due to a need to change growth media from glycerol media to methanol induction media, which minimizes inhibition of the AOX1 promoter by residual glycerol. Taking advantage of this behavior of the AOX1 promoter, we developed Buffered extra-YNB Glycerol Methanol (BYGM) auto-induction media (100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 2.68% w/v YNB, 0.4% v/v glycerol, 0.5% v/v methanol, and 8 x 10-5% w/v biotin) which not only simplified the protein expression process, but also optimized protein expression levels in P. pastoris. We successfully used this auto-induction method to overexpress the target in both MutS and Mut+ strains. Moreover, we show that this method can facilitate screening high-expressing clones, as well as enable parallel protein production in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular Cloning and Characterizations of Xylanase Inhibitor Protein from Wheat (Triticum Aestivum).</h4><p>X.

To avoid the inhibition to xylanases, it is necessary to define the conditions under which the inhibition takes place. In this study, we cloned the XIP gene from 2 different variety of Triticum aestivum, that is, Zhengmai 9023 and Zhengmai 366, and investigated the properties of XIP protein expressed by Pichia pastoris. The results showed that the 2 XIP genes (xip-9023 and xip-366) were highly homologous with only 3 nucleotide differences. XIP-9023 showed the optimal inhibition pH and temperature were 7 degrees C and 40 degrees C, respectively. Inhibition of xylanase by XIP-9023 reached the maximum in 40 min. At 50% inhibition of xylanase, the molar ratio of inhibitor: xylanase was 26:1. XIP-9023 was active to various fungal xylanases tested as well as to a bacterial xylanase produced by Paenibacillus sp. isolated from cow rumen.</p></details><hr><h4>Energy Charge as an Indicator of Pexophagy in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. Zhang, T. Liu, Front Microbiol 8 963 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28611759>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a good model for pexophagy research owing to its diverse pexophagy modes (macropexophagy and micropexophagy) exhibited during carbon-source shift from methanol to other carbon sources. The critical condition that triggers activation of macropexophagy and micropexophagy is important for clarifying the P. pastoris pexophagy mechanism and human peroxisomal disorders. In this study, the pexophagy modes of P. pastoris were confirmed by green fluorescent protein expression and alcohol oxidase and formate dehydrogenase activities. Furthermore, intracellular energy charge (EC) was found to be a determinant of pexophagy activation. During methanol induction, the EC was about 0.5. And the final EC value was related to the pexophagy mode when carbon source switched from methanol to others. Macropexophagy and micropexophagy occurred when the EC increased to 0.6-0.75 and above 0.75, respectively. Thus, different EC values were considered as the important factor to trigger different pexophagy modes in P. pastoris. The results obtained in this study could help in achieving better control of the pexophagy modes to study the pexophagy mechanism.</p></details><hr><h4>Biomedical applications of yeast- a patent view, part one: yeasts as workhorses for the production of therapeutics and vaccines.</h4><p>F.

Areas covered: This review provides general and patent-oriented insights into production of biopharmaceuticals by yeasts. Patents, wherever possible, were correlated to the original or review articles. The review describes applications of major GRAS (generally regarded as safe) yeasts for the production of therapeutic proteins and subunit vaccines; additionally, immunomodulatory properties of yeast cell wall components were reviewed for use of whole yeast cells as a new vaccine platform. The second part of the review will discuss yeast- humanization strategies and innovative applications. Expert opinion: Biomedical applications of yeasts were initiated by utilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for production of leavened (fermented) products, and advanced to serve to produce biopharmaceuticals. Higher biomass production and expression/secretion yields, more similarity of glycosylation patterns to mammals and possibility of host-improvement strategies through application of synthetic biology might enhance selection of Pichia pastoris (instead of S. cerevisiae) as a host for production of biopharmaceutical in future. Immunomodulatory properties of yeast cell wall beta-glucans and possibility of intracellular expression of heterologous pathogen/tumor antigens in yeast cells have expanded their application as a new platform, 'Whole Yeast Vaccines'.</p></details><hr><h4>Fusion of plectasin derivative NZ2114 with hydrophilic random coil polypeptide: Recombinant production in Pichia pastoris and antimicrobial activity against clinical strain MRSA.</h4><p>L. A. Lima et al., Biopolymers   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608428>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the roadblocks towards the practical use of antimicrobial peptides for medical use is their relatively high cost when synthesized chemically. Effective recombinant production has only been successful in some cases, such as the previously reported production in Pichia pastoris of the antimicrobial plectasin derivative peptide NZ2114. The same production host has also been used extensively to produce so-called protein-polymers: sequences that consist of repetitions of simple amino acid motifs found in structural proteins such as collagen and elastin, and that can be designed to self-assemble in micelles, fibers and hydrogels. With the eventual goal of producing recombinant biomaterials such as antimicrobial protein polymer, we here explore the secreted production in Pichia pastoris of a fusion of NZ2114 with a hydrophilic random coil protein polymer CP4 . The intact NZ2114-CP4 fusion copolymer was produced with a yield of purified protein on the order of 1 g.L-1 supernatant. We find that purified NZ2114-CP4 has an activity against clinical strain MRSA, but very much lower than activity of chemically synthesized NZ2114. We conclude that possibly, the activity of NZ2114 is impaired by the C-terminal attachment to the protein polymer chain, but other reasons for the low activity cannot yet be excluded either.

Zhang et al., Protein Expr Purif 136 20 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606662>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Botrytis cinerea BcSpl1 protein is a member of the cerato-platanin family, and consists of 137 amino acids and two disulfide bridges. This protein induces the onset of necrosis in infiltrated plant hosts. Recombinant BcSpl1 proteins produced in Pichia pastoris (pBcSpl1) and Escherichia coli (eBcSpl1) were initially compared regarding their abilities to induce necrosis and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The pBcSpl1 and eBcSpl1 treatments led to the development of necrotic lesions on tomato leaves, and provided tomato plants with SAR to B. cinerea. The lesion area of leaves infiltrated with the BcSpl1 proteins decreased by 22.7% (pBcSpl1) and 21.8% (eBcSpl1). Additionally, eBcSpl1 up-regulated the expression levels of some defense-related genes, including PR-1a, prosystemin, PI I, and PI II, as well as SIPK and TPK1b, which encode two protein kinases. Furthermore, eBcSpl1 exhibited chitin-binding properties. Our data revealed that the E. coli expression system produces higher BcSpl1 yields than the P. pastoris system. This high-yield expression of BcSpl1 may be relevant for future large-scale applications of this elicitor to improve crop production.</p></details><hr><h4>ATP Sulfurylase is Essential for the Utilization of Sulfamate as a Sulfur Source in the Yeast Komagataella pastoris (syn. Pichia pastoris).</h4><p>T. Linder, Curr Microbiol 74 1021 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28603806>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella pastoris (syn. Pichia pastoris) is one of the few known yeasts that can utilize sulfamate ([Formula: see text]) as a sulfur source. The biochemical pathway responsible for the catabolism of sulfamate has yet to be identified. The present study sought to investigate whether sulfamate catabolism proceeds through either of the inorganic sulfur intermediates sulfate ([Formula: see text]) or sulfite ([Formula: see text]) before its assimilation and subsequent incorporation into sulfur-containing amino acids and their derivatives. Two key genes in the K. pastoris inorganic sulfur assimilation pathway were deleted separately and the ability of each deletion mutant to utilize sulfamate and other selected sulfur sources was studied. Deletion of the MET3 gene (which encodes the enzyme ATP sulfurylase) did not affect growth on L-methionine, sulfite, methanesulfonate, or taurine but completely abolished growth on sulfate, methyl sulfate and sulfamate. Deletion of the MET5 gene (which encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme sulfite reductase) abolished growth on all tested sulfur sources except L-methionine. These results suggest that the catabolism of sulfamate proceeds through a sulfate intermediate before its assimilation.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression of a laccase from Coriolopsis gallica in Pichia pastoris using a modified alpha-factor preproleader.</h4><p>M. Avelar et al., Protein Expr Purif 136 14 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602730>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we communicate the heterologous expression of a laccase from Coriolopsis gallica in Pichia pastoris. This enzyme has been reported to efficiently degrade a variety of pollutants such as industrial dyes. The expression strategy included using a previously reported modified alpha-factor preproleader for enhanced secretion and pAOX1, a methanol-responsive promoter. Methanol concentration, copper salts concentration and temperature were varied in order to enhance laccase expression in this heterologous system. A volumetric activity of 250 U/L was achieved after 12-day culture in Fernbach flasks. The protein was recovered from the supernatant and purified, obtaining a preparation with 90% electrophoretic purity. The catalytic constants of the recombinant enzyme are almost identical to the fungal enzyme, thus rendering this system a useful tool for protein engineering of laccase from C. gallica.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of a novel GH11 xylanase from saline-alkali soil with excellent tolerance to high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol.</h4><p>H.

The purified recombinant Xyn11-1 showed its maximal activity at pH 6.0, and retained more than 60.4% of activity at pH 10.0, with good pH stability. Its optimal temperature was 50 degrees C and it was stable after incubation for 1 h at 30 degrees C. Furthermore, Xyn11-1 was highly salt-tolerant, retaining more than 77.4% of activity in the presence of 0.25-4 M NaCl and displaying more than 47.2% relative activity after being incubated in the presence of 5 M NaCl at 37 degrees C for 10 min. In addition, 5 mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, Cu2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ increased the xylanase activity by 22.3%, 8.8%, 7.1%, and 4.4%, respectively. Significantly, 93.4% and 59.8% of the optimal activity was retained in the presence of 2% and 10% (v/v) ethanol, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the Km,Vmax, and Kcat value of Xyn11-1 for beechwood xylan were 3.7 mg ml-1, 101.0 mumol min-1 mg-1 and 42.1 s-1, respectively. Xyn11-1 is a strict endo-beta-1,4-xylanase, its main enzymatic products being xylotetraose and xylopentaose. Xyn11-1 is the first reported GH11 xylanase isolated from saline-alkali soil, and has excellent tolerance of high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol, which indicates its great potential for basic research and industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Enzymatic Degradation of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters by P. pastoris Expressed Cutinase 1 from Thermobifida cellulosilytica.</h4><p>C. Gamerith et al., Front Microbiol 8 938 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596765>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To study hydrolysis of aromatic and aliphatic polyesters cutinase 1 from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Thc_Cut1) was expressed in P. pastoris. No significant differences between the expression of native Thc_Cut1 and of two glycosylation site knock out mutants (Thc_Cut1_koAsn and Thc_Cut1_koST) concerning the total extracellular protein concentration and volumetric activity were observed. Hydrolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was shown for all three enzymes based on quantification of released products by HPLC and similar concentrations of released terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) were detected for all enzymes. Both tested aliphatic polyesters poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) were hydrolyzed by Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut1_koST, although PBS was hydrolyzed to significantly higher extent than PHBV. These findings were also confirmed via quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis; for PHBV only a small mass change was observed while the mass of PBS thin films decreased by 93% upon enzymatic hydrolysis with Thc_Cut1. Although both enzymes led to similar concentrations of released products upon hydrolysis of PET and PHBV, Thc_Cut1_koST was found to be significantly more active on PBS than the native Thc_Cut1. Hydrolysis of PBS films by Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut1_koST was followed by weight loss and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Within 96 h of hydrolysis up to 92 and 41% of weight loss were detected with Thc_Cut1_koST and Thc_Cut1, respectively. Furthermore, SEM characterization of PBS films clearly showed that enzyme tretment resulted in morphological changes of the film surface.</p></details><hr><h4>Multicopy plasmid integration in Komagataella phaffii mediated by a defective auxotrophic marker.</h4><p>M. O. Betancur et al., Microb Cell Fact 16 99 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28595601>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> A commonly used approach to improve recombinant protein production is to increase the levels of expression by providing extra-copies of a heterologous gene. In Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) this is usually accomplished by transforming cells with an expression vector carrying a drug-resistance marker following a screening for multicopy clones on plates with increasingly higher concentrations of an antibiotic. Alternatively, defective auxotrophic markers can be used for the same purpose. These markers are generally transcriptionally impaired genes lacking most of the promoter region. Among the defective markers commonly used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is leu2-d, an allele of LEU2 which is involved in leucine metabolism. Cells transformed with this marker can recover prototrophy when they carry multiple copies of leu2-d in order to compensate the poor transcription from this defective allele.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A K. phaffii strain auxotrophic for leucine (M12) was constructed by disrupting endogenous LEU2. The resulting strain was successfully transformed with a vector carrying leu2-d and an EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter gene. Vector copy numbers were determined from selected clones which grew to different colony sizes on transformation plates. A direct correlation was observed between colony size, number of integrated vectors and EGFP production. By using this approach we were able to isolate genetically stable clones bearing as many as 20 integrated copies of the vector and with no significant effects on cell growth.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> In this work we have successfully developed a genetic system based on a defective auxotrophic which can be applied to improve heterologous protein production in K. phaffii. The system comprises a K. phaffii leu2 strain and an expression vector carrying the defective leu2-d marker which allowed the isolation of multicopy clones after a single transformation step. Because a linear correlation was observed between copy number and heterologous protein production, this system may provide a simple approach to improve recombinant protein productivity in K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant thermo-alkali-stable endoglucanase of Myceliopthora thermophila BJA (rMt-egl): Biochemical characteristics and applicability in enzymatic saccharification of agro-residues.</h4><p>P. Phadtare, S. Joshi, T.

The codon optimized endoglucanase gene (Mt-egl) has been constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris under the regulation of GAP promoter. Recombinant endoglucanase (rMt-egl), purified by size exclusion chromatography, has been confirmed to be a monomeric protein of approximately 47kDa. rMt-egl is optimally active at pH 10 and 50 degrees C, displaying stability in broad pH and temperature ranges, with a t1/2 of 60 and 15min at 90 and 100 degrees C, respectively. This retained approximately 70% of activity after 3h incubation at pH 5-12. The Km, Vmax, kcat and kcat/Km of rMt-egl were 5mgmL-1, 20mumolesmin-1mg-1, 1.02x103s-1 and 204s-1mg-1mL-1, respectively. Homology modeling and bioinformatics analysis confirmed catalytically important role of glutamate 234 and 344. rMt-egl released high amounts of reducing sugars from wheat bran and corn cobs (421 and 382mgg-1), thus making it a useful biocatalyst for producing bioethanol and fine chemicals from agro-residues.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant protein expression of Moringa oleifera lectin in methylotrophic yeast as active coagulant for sustainable high turbid water treatment.</h4><p>M.

Introducing the gene encoding MoL into a host, Pichia pastoris, to secrete soluble recombinant protein is assessed in this study. Initial screening using PCR confirmed the insertion of MoL gene, and SDS-PAGE analysis detected the MoL protein at 8 kDa. Cultured optimization showed the highest MoL protein at 520 mg/L was observed at 28 degrees C for 144 h of culturing by induction in 1% methanol. Approximately, 0.40 mg/mL of recombinant MoL protein showed 95 +/- 2% turbidity removal of 1% kaolin suspension. In 0.1% kaolin suspension, the concentration of MoL at 10 mug/mL exhibits the highest turbidity reduction at 68 +/- 1%. Thus, recombinant MoL protein from P. pastoris is an effective coagulant for water treatment.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhanced expression of lipase I from Galactomyces geotrichum by codon optimisation in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H. Qiao et al., Protein Expr Purif 138 34 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583876>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Relatively poor heterologous protein yields have limited the commerical applications of Galactomyces geotrichum lipase I (GGl I) efficacy trials. To address this, we have redesigned the GGl I gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) while retaining the same amino acid sequence. The wild type and codon optimised GGl I (GGl I-wt and GGl I-op) were synthesised and cloned into pPICZalphaA with an N-terminal 6 x His tag sequence and expressed in P. pastoris X 33. The hydrolytic activity of GGl I-op was 150 U/mL, whereas the activity of the GGl I-wt could not be detected. GGl I-op recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and then characterised. The identity and purity of GGl I were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. Enzymatic deglycosylation was used to show that the lipase is a glycosylated protein, containing approximately 10% sugar. The molecular weight (MW) of the GGl I secreted by recombinant P. pastoris was approximated at 63 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant lipase were 8.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was active over a broad pH range (7.0-9.0) and temperature range (20 degrees C-45 degrees C). The lipase showed high activity toward medium- and long-chain fatty acid methyl esters (C8-C16) and retained much of its activity in the presence of Tween-80 and Trition X-100. Lipase activity was stimulated by Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+ and inhibited by Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+ and Co2+. This lipase may prove useful to the detergent industry and in organic synthesis reactions.</p></details><hr><h4>Anion-Exchange Chromatography Coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry: A Powerful Tool for Merging Targeted and Non-targeted Metabolomics.</h4><p>M. Schwaiger et al., Anal Chem 89 7667 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28581703>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, simultaneous targeted metabolic profiling by isotope dilution and non-targeted fingerprinting is proposed for cancer cell studies. The novel streamlined metabolomics workflow was established using anion-exchange chromatography (IC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). The separation time of strong anion-exchange (2 mm column, flow rate 380 muL min-1, injection volume 5 muL) could be decreased to 25 min for a target list comprising organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides. Internal standardization by fully 13C labeled Pichia pastoris extracts enabled absolute quantification of the primary metabolites in adherent cancer cell models. Limits of detection (LODs) in the low nanomolar range and excellent intermediate precisions of the isotopologue ratios (on average <5%, N = 5, over 40 h) were observed. As a result of internal standardization, linear dynamic ranges over 4 orders of magnitude (5 nM-50 muM, R2 > 0.99) were obtained. Experiments on drug-sensitive versus resistant SW480 cancer cells showed the feasibility of merging analytical tasks into one analytical run. Comparing fingerprinting with and without internal standard proved that the presence of the 13C labeled yeast extract required for absolute quantification was not detrimental to non-targeted data evaluation. Several interesting metabolites were discovered by accurate mass and comparing MS2 spectra (acquired in ddMS2 mode) with spectral libraries. Significant differences revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes of drug-sensitive and resistant SW480 cells.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the Catalytic Performance of a Talaromyces leycettanus alpha-Amylase by Changing the Linker Length.</h4><p>D.

The wild type and three mutant enzymes were then expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 to identify the roles of linker length (Amy13A21 and Amy13A33) and CBM20 (Amy13A-CBM) in catalysis. All enzymes had similar enzymatic properties, exhibiting optimal activities at pH 4.5-5.0 and 55-60 degrees C, but varied in catalytic performance. When using soluble starch as the substrate, Amy13A21 and Amy13A33 showed specific activities (926.3 and 537.8 units/mg, respectively, vs 252.1 units/mg) and catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km, 25.7 and 22.0 mL s-1 mg-1, respectively, vs 15.4 mL s-1 mg-1) higher than those of the wild type, while Amy13A-CBM performed worse during catalysis. This study reveals the key roles of the CBM and linker length in the catalysis of GH13 alpha-amylase.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning, Production and Characterization of a Glycoside Hydrolase Family 7 Enzyme from the Gut Microbiota of the Termite Coptotermes curvignathus.</h4><p>J.

Woon et al., Mol Biotechnol 59 271 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28573450>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Coptotermes curvignathus is a termite that, owing to its ability to digest living trees, serves as a gold mine for robust industrial enzymes. This unique characteristic reflects the presence of very efficient hydrolytic enzyme systems including cellulases. Transcriptomic analyses of the gut of C. curvignathus revealed that carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) were encoded by 3254 transcripts and that included 69 transcripts encoding glycoside hydrolase family 7 (GHF7) enzymes. Since GHF7 enzymes are useful to the biomass conversion industry, a gene encoding for a GHF7 enzyme (Gh1254) was synthesized, sub-cloned and expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Expressed GH1254 had an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa, but purification was hampered by its low expression levels in shaken flasks. To obtain more of the enzyme, GH1254 was produced in a bioreactor that resulted in a fourfold increase in crude enzyme levels. The purified enzyme was active towards soluble synthetic substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside and 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-lactoside but was non-hydrolytic towards Avicel or carboxymethyl cellulose. GH1254 catalyzed optimally at 35 degrees C and maintained 70% of its activity at 25 degrees C. This enzyme is thus potentially useful in food industries employing low-temperature conditions.</p></details><hr><h4>Genome-wide characterization of cellulases from the hemi-biotrophic plant pathogen, Bipolaris sorokiniana, reveals the presence of a highly stable GH7 endoglucanase.</h4><p>S.

To understand the role of these CWDE in B. sorokiniana, the first step is to identify and annotate all possible genes of the GH families like GH3, GH6, GH7, GH45 and AA9 and then characterize them biochemically.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We confirmed and annotated the homologs of GH3, GH6, GH7, GH45 and AA9 enzymes in the B. sorokiniana genome using the sequence and domain features of these families. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of these homologs revealed that the transcripts of the BsGH7-3 (3rd homolog of the GH 7 family in B. sorokiniana) were most abundant. BsGH7-3, the gene of BsGH7-3, was thus cloned into pPICZalphaC Pichia pastoris vector and expressed in X33 P. pastoris host to be characterized. BsGH7-3 enzyme showed a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C and a pHopt of 8.1. BsGH7-3 was identified to be an endoglucanase based on its broad substrate specificity and structural comparisons with other such endoglucanases. BsGH7-3 has a very long half-life and retains 100% activity even in the presence of 4 M NaCl, 4 M KCl and 20% (v/v) ionic liquids. The enzyme activity is stimulated up to fivefold in the presence of Mn+2 and Fe+2 without any deleterious effects on enzyme thermostability.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Here we reanalysed the B. sorokiniana genome and selected one GH7 enzyme for further characterization. The present work demonstrates that BsGH7-3 is an endoglucanase with a long half-life and no loss in activity in the presence of denaturants like salt and ionic liquids, and lays the foundation towards exploring the Bipolaris genome for other cell wall-degrading enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of a bacterial laccase, CueO from Escherichia coli K12 in Pichia pastoris GS115 and its application on the decolorization of synthetic dyes.</h4><p>X.

This report was aimed to the high-level expression of a laccase, CueO from Escherichia coli K12 in Pichia pastoris GS115 and its application on decolorization of synthetic dyes. The yacK gene coding CueO was cloned into an expression vector of Pichia pastoris, pHBM905BDM and expressed in a secretory form with Pichia pastoris GS115 as the host. The yield of the recombinant protein was 556mg/L with high-density fermentation and the enzyme activity was about 41,000U/L. The recombinant laccase was purified and characterized. Its optimum pH and temperature was 3.0 and 55 degrees C with 2, 2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate, respectively. This recombinant protein was thermostable and its half life at 70 degrees C was about 60min. In the presence of natural redox mediator acetosyringone, the purified recombinant laccase decolorized 98.1% and 98.5% of Congo red, malachite green, respectively. It also decolorized 90.03% of Remazol brilliant blue R without this mediator. In addition, this enzyme was applied on the decolorization of wastewater from a textile printing factory and showed an obvious bleaching effect.</p></details><hr><h4>Ontak-like human IL-2 fusion toxin.</h4><p>Z.

However, it has been discontinued clinically due to the production issue related to the bacterial expression system with difficult purification. Recently we have developed monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins targeting human CD25+ cells using advanced unique diphtheria toxin resistant yeast Pichia Pastoris expression system. In vitro efficacy characterization using human CD25+ HUT102/6TG cells demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent isoforms are potent and the bivalent isoform is approximately two logs more potent than the monovalent isoform. In this study, we further assessed the in vivo efficacy of the human IL-2 fusion toxins using human CD25+ HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mouse model. The data demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins significantly prolonged the survival of the human CD25+ tumor-bearing NSG mice in a dose-dependent manner. Then we further assessed the residual tumor cells from the HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mice using the residual tumor cell bearing NSG mouse model. The results demonstrated that the residual tumor cells were still sensitive to the continual treatment with the human IL-2 fusion toxin. This yeast-expressed human IL-2 fusion toxin will be a promising candidate to replace the clinically discontinued Ontak(R).</p></details><hr><h4>Insights into the prevalence and underlying causes of clonal variation through transcriptomic analysis in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Aw, G. R. Barton, D. J. Leak, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 5045 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534062>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Clonal variation, wherein a range of specific productivities of secreted proteins are observed from supposedly identical transformants, is an accepted aspect of working with Pichia pastoris. It means that a significant number of transformants need to be tested to obtain a representative sample, and in commercial protein production, companies regularly screen thousands of transformants to select for the highest secretor. Here, we have undertaken a detailed investigation of this phenomenon by characterising clones transformed with the human serum albumin gene. The titers of nine clones, each containing a single copy of the human serum albumin gene (identified by qPCR), were measured and the clones grouped into three categories, namely, high-, mid- and low-level secretors. Transcriptomic analysis, using microarrays, showed that no regulatory patterns consistently correlated with titer, suggesting that the causes of clonal variation are varied. However, a number of physiological changes appeared to underlie the differences in titer, suggesting there is more than one biochemical signature for a high-secreting strain. An anomalous low-secreting strain displaying high transcript levels that appeared to be nutritionally starved further emphasises the complicated nature of clonal variation.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel thermostable GH45 endoglucanase from Chaetomium thermophilum and its biodegradation of pectin.</h4><p>Q.

Sequence alignment indicated that the CTendo45 enzyme belonged to glycoside hydrolase family 45. The recombinant enzyme was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and its apparent molecular mass was estimated to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme displayed maximum activity at 70 degrees C and pH 4. CTendo45 was stable at 60 degrees C for 1 h, and residual activities of 78.9% and 65.6% were estimated after 1 h at 70 degrees C and 80 degrees C, respectively. Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ were found to have beneficial effects on the enzyme activity to different degrees. The specific activity of purified CTendo45 was 1.52 IU mg-1 and the Km value was 59.6 mug ml-1 with a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose substrate. Moreover, CTendo45 exhibited high hydrolysis activity towards pectin, and the hydrolysis products were mainly galacturonic acid oligosaccharides. CTendo45 is the first reported bifunctional enzyme in glycoside hydrolase family 45 from C. thermophilum that is able to hydrolyze both cellulose and pectin. The biochemical properties of this recombinant CTendo45 make it a potentially effective glycoside hydrolase for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Functional regions of the peroxin Pex19 necessary for peroxisome biogenesis.</h4><p>G. Agrawal, H. H. Shang, Z. J. Xia, S. Subramani, J Biol Chem 292 11547 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526747>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The peroxins Pex19 and Pex3 play an indispensable role in peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) biogenesis, peroxisome division, and inheritance. Pex19 plays multiple roles in these processes, but how these functions relate to the structural organization of the Pex19 domains is unresolved. To this end, using deletion mutants, we mapped the Pex19 regions required for peroxisome biogenesis in the yeast Pichia pastoris Surprisingly, import-competent peroxisomes still formed when Pex19 domains previously believed to be required for biogenesis were deleted, although the peroxisome size was larger than that in wild-type cells. Moreover, these mutants exhibited a delay of 14-24 h in peroxisome biogenesis. The shortest functional N-terminal (NTCs) and C-terminal constructs (CTCs) were Pex19 (aa 1-150) and Pex19 (aa 89-300), respectively. Deletions of the N-terminal Pex3-binding site disrupted the direct interactions of Pex19 with Pex3, but preserved interactions with a membrane peroxisomal targeting signal (mPTS)-containing PMP, Pex10. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal mPTS-binding domain of Pex19 disrupted its interaction with Pex10 while leaving the Pex19-Pex3 interactions intact. However, Pex11 and Pex25 retained their interactions with both N- and C-terminal deletion mutants. NTC-CTC co-expression improved growth and reversed the larger-than-normal peroxisome size observed with the single deletions. Pex25 was critical for peroxisome formation with the CTC variants, and its overexpression enhanced their interactions with Pex3 and aided the growth of both NTC and CTC Pex19 variants. In conclusion, physical segregation of the Pex3- and PMP-binding domains of Pex19 has provided novel insights into the modular architecture of Pex19. We define the minimum region of Pex19 required for peroxisome biogenesis and a unique role for Pex25 in this process.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and Characterization of Windmill Palm Tree (Trachycarpus fortunei) Peroxidase by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>B.

No recombinant plant peroxidase products have been available on the commercial market. The gene encoding peroxidase was cloned from windmill palm tree leaves. The codon-optimized gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris for expression. The recombinant windmill palm tree peroxidase (rWPTP) expressed by P. pastoris showed high stability under pH 2-10 and temperatures up to 70 degrees C to many metallic salts and organic solvents. The substrate specificity of WPTP was determined, and among the substrates tested, 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was most suitable for WPTP. The Michaelis constants with the substrates H2O2 and ABTS were 4.6 x 10-4 and 1.6 x 10-4 M, respectively. The rWPTP expressed in P. pastoris may be a suitable enzyme for the biosynthesis of polymers because of its high stability and activity under acidic conditions.</p></details><hr><h4>Investigating the effect of carbon source on rabies virus glycoprotein production in Pichia pastoris by a transcriptomic approach.</h4><p>S. Ben Azoun, H. Kallel, Microbiologyopen 6  (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523730>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several factors affect protein expression in Pichia pastoris, one among them is the carbon source. In this work, we studied the effect of this factor on the expression level of rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G) in two recombinant clones harboring seven copies of the gene of interest. The expression was driven either by the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter or the inducible alcohol oxidase1 (AOX1) promoter. Clones were compared in terms of cell physiology and carbon source metabolism. The transcription levels of 16 key genes involved in the central metabolic pathway, the methanol catabolism, and the oxidative stress were investigated in both clones. Cell size, as a parameter reflecting cell physiological changes, was also monitored. Our results showed that when glucose was used as the sole carbon source, large cells were obtained. Transcript levels of the genes of the central metabolic pathway were also upregulated, whereas antioxidative gene transcript levels were low. By contrast, the use of methanol as a carbon source generated small cells and a shift in carbon metabolism toward the dissimilatory pathway by the upregulation of formaldehyde dehydrogenase gene and the downregulation of those of the central metabolic. These observations are in favor of the use of glucose to enhance the expression of RABV-G in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Impact of "a" determinant mutations on detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HBV strains from Chinese patients with occult hepatitis B.</h4><p>X. Huang et al., J Med Virol 89 1796 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513915>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study was designed to detect mutations that occur within the "a" determinant in the S gene of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with occult hepatitis B (OHB), and to analyze the influence of these mutations on expression and reactivity of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Twenty-three certified OHB samples were compared to 32 HBsAg positive samples from patients with chronic hepatitis B. The median HBV DNA levels in the OHB group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.0001). Mutations within the "a" determinant were analyzed by gene amplification and sequencing. This revealed mixed infections in which clones within a sample displayed either different mutations or mutations in association with clones that exhibited wild type amino acid patterns. Sequencing analysis also showed a significant difference between the proportions of amino acid mutations observed in the OHB and control groups. Seven recombinant S (rS) proteins with corresponding OHB mutations and three wild type alleles were expressed and purified in the Pichia pastoris expression system to preserve conformational attributes, and their reactivity analyzed using six commercial HBsAg assays. The OHB sera were HBsAg nonreactive while the rS proteins with corresponding OHB mutations were universally reactive. Thus, we postulate that the reduced binding affinity between mutated HBsAg and its antibody may not be as important in defining OHB as is the effect of specific mutations in the preS/S region of the genome that affect the synthesis and secretion of the S protein and/or the virion.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a new multifunctional beta-glucosidase from Musca domestica.</h4><p>S.

It has the maximum activities for salicin (25.9 +/- 1.8 U mg-1), cellobiose (40.1 +/- 2.3 U mg-1) and cellulose (27.6 +/- 3.5 U mg-1). The wide-range substrate activities of the beta-glucosidase were further verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectra. Structural analysis shows that the beta-glucosidase belongs to glycoside hydrolase family Iota and possesses O-glycosylation sites.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Thus, a multifunctional beta-glucosidase was expressed from M. domestica and provides a potential tool for industrial application of cellulose.</p></details><hr><h4>In vitro characterization of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) IL-26 in regulating inflammatory factors.</h4><p>X.

It is well accepted that IL-26 was a crucial member of IL-10 family which acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in human. However, the role of IL-26 in regulating inflammation in lower vertebrates including teleost has not been defined yet. In the present study, grass carp IL-26 (gcIL-26) coding sequence was isolated and identified. Its chromosomal synteny was also analyzed, showing that gcIL-26 gene is flanked by IL-22 and IFN-gamma genes with the same transcriptional orientation as seen in human, amphibian and zebrafish. Given that zebrafish and grass carp IL-26 shared relatively low amino acid identities with human IL-26, the functional roles of fish IL-26 are indispensable to be elucidated. Accordingly, recombinant gcIL-26 (rgcIL-26) was prepared by using Pichia pastoris expression system, and it was found to be partially glycosylated. Using grass carp head kidney leucocytes as cell model, rgcIL-26 displayed the bioactivity to stimulate the mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-1beta and IL-6, while inhibit mRNA expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Moreover, rgcIL-26 also up-regulated inos expression and NO production in grass carp monocytes/macrophages, strengthening its pro-inflammatory properties in fish. Those results collectively demonstrated the functional role of IL-26 in regulating inflammatory response in fish.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a novel recombinant cyanate hydratase (rTl-Cyn) in Pichia pastoris, characteristics and applicability in the detoxification of cyanate.</h4><p>B.

The purified rTl-Cyn had a molecular mass of approximately 20kDa on SDS-PAGE, with Km, Vmax, kcat and kcat/Km values of 0.34mM, 2857.14micromolesmg-1min-1, 2.14x104s-1 and 6.3 x107M-1s-1, respectively. Its properties of thermostability, pH stability, and heavy metals insensitivity, make it a suitable candidate for bioremediation in extreme environments. The rTl-Cyn was able to degrade toxic cyanate completely with the liberation of ammonia, which was confirmed by FTIR analysis. This is the first report of any known cyanate hydratase that has been expressed in P. pastoris, characterized and effectively evaluated for cyanate detoxification.</p></details><hr><h4>Thermostable multifunctional GH74 xyloglucanase from Myceliophthora thermophila: high-level expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of the recombinant protein.</h4><p>O. V. Berezina et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 5653 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477154>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A xyloglucanase of the GH74 family was identified in the thermophilic fungus strain Myceliophthora thermophila VKPM F-244, and its gene sequence was optimized for cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant xyloglucanase MtXgh74 exhibited the highest activity toward tamarind seed xyloglucan with a K M value of 0.51 +/- 0.06 mg/mL. The activities on barley beta-glucan and carboxymethylcellulose were about 4 and 2%, respectively, compared to xyloglucan. Maximum xyloglucanase activity was observed at 70-75 degrees C and pH 6.5. After pre-incubation at 50 degrees C, pH 6.0 for 3 h, the enzyme retained 100% of its activity. The half-life of MtXgh74 at 60 degrees C, pH 6.0 was 40 min. In P. pastoris, MtXgh74 was produced in glycosylated form. The enzyme production in a 1 L bioreactor resulted in a yield of 118 U/mL or 5.3 g/L after 51 h fermentation. Kinetic studies of the hydrolysis product formation suggest that MtXgh74 has an endo-processive mode of action. The final products were the standard xyloglucan building blocks XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, and XLLG. Additionally, MtXgh74 hydrolyzed various linkages within the xyloglucan building blocks XXXG, XXLG, and XLXG (except XLLG) producing diverse low molecular weight oligosaccharides which may be identified by MALDI-TOF as XG, XX, XXG/GXX/XGX, XXX, LG, LX/XL, XLX/XXL, LLG, GXXXG, GXLLG, XLLGX. The unique combination of different activities within one enzyme along with its high thermostability and specificity toward xyloglucan makes MtXgh74 a promising candidate enzyme for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>LILY-lipidome isotope labeling of yeast: in vivo synthesis of 13C labeled reference lipids for quantification by mass spectrometry.</h4><p>E.

In this work, we introduce lipidome isotope labeling of yeast (LILY) in order to produce (non-radioactive) isotopically labeled eukaryotic lipid standards in yeast for normalization and quantification in mass spectrometric assays. More specifically, LILY is a fast and efficient in vivo labeling strategy in Pichia pastoris for the production of 13C labeled lipid library further paving the way to comprehensive compound-specific internal standardization in quantitative mass spectrometry based assays. More than 200 lipid species (from PA, PC, PE, PG, PI, PS, LysoGP, CL, DAG, TAG, DMPE, Cer, HexCer, IPC, MIPC) were obtained from yeast extracts with an excellent 13C enrichment >99.5%, as determined by complementary high resolution mass spectrometry based shotgun and high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. In a first proof of principle study we tested the relative and absolute quantification capabilities of the 13C enriched lipids obtained by LILY using a parallel reaction monitoring based LC-MS approach. In relative quantification it could be shown that compound specific internal standardization was essential for the accuracy extending the linear dynamic range to four orders of magnitude. Excellent analytical figures of merit were observed for absolute quantification for a selected panel of 5 investigated glycerophospholipids (e.g. LOQs around 5 fmol absolute; typical concentrations ranging between 1 to 10 nmol per 108 yeast cell starting material; RSDs <10% (N = 4)).</p></details><hr><h4>An anti-amoebic vaccine: generation of the recombinant antigen LC3 from Entamoeba histolytica linked to mutated exotoxin A (PEDeltaIII) via the Pichia pastoris system.</h4><p>S.

To ameliorate the effects of future outbreaks as well as to prepare for biodefense, a process for the production of a recombinant protein vaccine candidate is under development. Previously, we reported the 5 L scale expression and purification of a promising recombinant SARS vaccine candidate, RBD219-N1, the 218-amino acid residue receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus expressed in yeast-Pichia pastoris X-33. When adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, this protein elicited high neutralizing antibody titers and high RBD-specific antibody titers. However, the yield of RBD219-N1 (60 mg RBD219-N1 per liter of fermentation supernatant; 60 mg/L FS) still required improvement to reach our target of >100 mg/L FS. In this study, we optimized the 10 L scale production process and increased the fermentation yield 6- to 7-fold to 400 mg/L FS with purification recovery >50%. A panel of characterization tests indicated that the process is reproducible and that the purified, tag-free RBD219-N1 protein has high purity and a well-defined structure and is therefore a suitable candidate for production under current Good Manufacturing Practice and future phase-1 clinical trials.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of three Camellia sinensis small heat shock protein genes confers temperature stress tolerance in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana.</h4><p>M.

Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are crucial for protecting plants against biotic and abiotic stresses, especially heat stress. However, knowledge concerning the functions of Camellia sinensis sHSP in heat and cold stresses remains poorly understood. In this study, three C. sinensis sHSP genes (i.e., CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8) were isolated and characterized using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technology. The CsHSPs expression levels in C. sinensis leaves were significantly up-regulated by heat and cold stresses. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8 belong to sHSP Classes I, II, and IV, respectively. Heterologous expression of the three CsHSP genes in Pichia pastoris cells enhanced heat and cold stress tolerance. When exposed to heat and cold treatments, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8 had lower malondialdehyde contents, ion leakage, higher proline contents, and transcript levels of stress-related genes (e.g., AtPOD, AtAPX1, AtP5CS2, and AtProT1) compared with the control line. In addition, improved seed germination vigor was also observed in the CsHSP-overexpressing seeds under heat stress. Taken together, our results suggest that the three identified CsHSP genes play key roles in heat and cold tolerance.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and identification of a novel steroid 11alpha-hydroxylase gene from Absidia coerulea.</h4><p>R.

Although it is well established that enzymes involved in fungal hydroxylation of steroids are cytochrome P450s (CYP), few fungal steroid hydroxylase genes have been identified. In this study, we identified a novel 11alpha-hydroxylase gene CYP5311B1 from Absidia coerulea AS3.65 by a combination of transcriptome sequencing, real-time qRT-PCR and heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of CYP5311B1 is predicted to encode a CYP protein of 527 amino acids whose expression in Pichia cells was confirmed by western blot. In addition, the major hydroxylation product was characterized by HPLC and 2D NMR. CYP5311B1 was highly induced by steroid substrate at the transcriptional level. The cloning and identification of an 11alpha-hydroxylase gene from A. coerulea should aid in a better understanding of the structural basis underlying regio- and stereoselectivity, and substrate specificity of fungal steroid 11alpha-hydroxylases, thus facilitating the engineering of more efficient steroid hydroxylases for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of the enzymatically active legumain-like cysteine proteinase TvLEGU-1 of Trichomonas vaginalis in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>G. Resendiz-Cardiel, R. Arroyo, J. Ortega-Lopez, Protein Expr Purif 134 104 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419821>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The legumain-like cysteine proteinase TvLEGU-1 from Trichomonas vaginalis plays a major role in trichomonal cytoadherence. However, its structure-function characterization has been limited by the lack of a reliable recombinant expression platform to produce this protein in its native folded conformation. TvLEGU-1 has been expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and all efforts to refold it have failed. Here, we describe the expression of the synthetic codon-optimized tvlegu-1 (tvlegu-1-opt) gene in Pichia pastoris strain X-33 (Mut+) under the inducible AOX1 promoter. The active TvLEGU-1 recombinant protein (rTvLEGU-1) was secreted into the medium when tvlegu-1-opt was fused to the Aspergillus niger alpha-amylase signal peptide. The rTvLEGU-1 secretion was influenced by the gene copy number and induction temperature. Data indicate that increasing tvlegu-1-opt gene copy number was detrimental for heterologous expression of the enzymatically active TvLEGU-1. Indeed, expression of TvLEGU-1 had a greater impact on cell viability for those clones with 26 or 29 gene copy number, and cell lysis was observed when the induction was carried out at 30 degrees C. The enzyme activity in the medium was higher when the induction was carried out at 16 degrees C and in P. pastoris clones with lower gene copy number. The results presented here suggest that both copy number and induction temperature affect the rTvLEGU-1 expression in its native-like and active conformation.</p></details><hr><h4>Sweat allergy: Extrinsic or intrinsic?</h4><p>T. Hiragun et al., J Dermatol Sci 87 3 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28416076>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sweat is an exacerbation factor in atopic dermatitis (AD) in all age groups. A body core temperature elevation with sweating triggers cholinergic urticaria (CholU). We recently reported that AD symptoms are improved by tannic acid-containing spray, which suppresses the basophil histamine release induced by semi-purified sweat antigen in vitro, and by showering, which removes antigens in sweat from the skin surface. Sweat contains small amount of proteins including proteases, protease inhibitors, and anti-microbial peptides. We finally identified MGL_1304 secreted by Malassezia (M.) globosa as a major histamine - releasing antigen in human sweat. MGL_1304 is a 17-kDa protein in sweat that elicits almost the highest histamine - release activity from basophils of patients with AD and CholU among antigens derived from Malassezia species. Moreover, serum levels of anti-MGL_1304 IgE were significantly higher in patients with AD and CholU than in normal controls. The recombinant protein produced by Pichia pastoris possessed comparable allergenicity to native MGL_1304. We found a monoclonal IgE antibody against MGL_1304 which did not elicit histamine release from sensitized mast cells. Desensitization therapy using autologous sweat, or MGL_1304 purified from culture of M. globosa or its cognates might be beneficial for patients with intractable CholU due to sweat allergy.</p></details><hr><h4>Crystal structure of RNA polymerase II from Komagataella pastoris.</h4><p>H.

In this work, the crystal structure of Pol II from the methylotropic yeast Komagataella pastoris (Pichia pastoris) was determined. While the structure is highly homologous to that of Pol II from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the stalk and clamp modules of the K. pastoris Pol II displayed large inward rotations, closing the central cleft to a greater extent than in the known S. cerevisiae Pol II structures. The conformational differences reflect the inherent flexibilities of the stalk and the clamp, as additional low-resolution structures of K. pastoris Pol II in different crystal forms revealed diverse stalk and clamp orientations. Comparisons with other eukaryotic/archaeal RNA polymerase structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed the distributions of the stalk and clamp orientations. The conformational plasticity should be essential for transcriptional functions and binding various regulatory factors.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression of Thermobifida fusca E7 LPMO in Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli and their functional characterization.</h4><p>K. B. Rodrigues et al., Carbohydr Res 448 175 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411891>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discovery of lytic polysaccharides monooxygenases copper dependent (LPMOs) revolutionized the classical concept that the cleavage of cellulose is a hydrolytic process in recent years. These enzymes carry out oxidative cleavage of cellulose (and other polysaccharides), acting synergistically with cellulases and other hydrolases. In fact, LPMOs have the potential for increasing the efficiency of the lignocellulosic biomass conversion in biofuels and high value chemicals. Among a small number of microbial LPMOs that have been characterized, some LPMOs were expressed and characterized biochemically from the bacteria Thermobifida fusca, using the host Escherichia coli. In this work, the E7 LPMO protein of T. fusca was expressed both in E. coli (native DNA sequence) and Pichia pastoris (codon-optimized DNA sequence), for further analysis of oxidative cleavage, with PASC (phosphoric acid swollen cellulose) and Avicel PH-101 substrates, using mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectra results of Avicel PH-101 and PASC cleavages by purified E7 LPMO expressed in E. coli and in P. pastoris allowed the visualization of compounds corresponding to oxidized and non-oxidized oligosaccharides. Further optimization of reactions will be performed, since it was found only one degree of polymerization (DP 7). This work demonstrated that it is possible to produce the E7 LPMO from T. fusca in the host P. pastoris, and the recombinant protein was shown to be active on cellulose. The approach used in the present work could be an alternative to produce this bacterial LPMO for cellulose cleavage.</p></details><hr><h4>Implementation of data-dependent isotopologue fragmentation in 13C-based metabolic flux analysis.</h4><p>T.

The implemented QTOFMS method employs automated MS/MS triggering of higher abundant, biologically relevant isotopologues for generating positional information of the respective metabolite. Using this advanced isotopologue selective fragmentation approach enables the generation of significant tandem mass isotopomer data within a short cycle time without compromising sensitivity. Due to a lack of suitable reference material certified for isotopologue ratios, a Pichia pastoris cell extract with a defined 13C distribution as well as a cell extract from a 13C-based metabolic flux experiment were employed for proof of concept. Moreover, a method inter-comparison with an already established GC-CI-(Q)TOFMS approach was conducted. Both methods showed good agreement on isotopologue and tandem mass isotopomer distributions for the two different cell extracts.

Sm14 belongs to a family of fatty-acid binding proteins and appears to play an important role in uptake, transport, and compartmentalization of lipids in S. mansoni and it is a potential vaccine candidate in both humans and domesticated animals. The Sm14 gene was codon-optimized for expression in P. pastoris, and placed under transcription of the strong methanol inducible AOX1 promoter. Mut+ transformants were selected and used in fed-batch cultivation using a 2.5L fermenter equipped with an on-line methanol control system in order to maintain constant methanol levels during induction. Optimal conditions for the expression of Sm14 by P. pastoris were found to be: dissolved oxygen at 40%, temperature of 25 degrees C, pH 5.0, and a constant methanol concentration of 1 gL-1. Our results show that a correctly processed Sm14 was secreted into the culture medium at levels of approximately 250 mg L-1. Sm14 from clarified culture medium was purified using a two-step procedure: anion-exchange chromatography followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, resulting in >95% purity with a final yield of 40% from the starting cell culture medium. This product has been tested in preliminary clinical trials and shown to elicit an antibody response with no adverse reactions.</p></details><hr><h4>A new proteinaceous pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) identified in Ascomycete fungi induces cell death in Solanaceae.</h4><p>B.

We characterized a novel fungal PAMP, Cell Death Inducing 1 (RcCDI1), identified in the Rhynchosporium commune transcriptome sampled at an early stage of barley (Hordeum vulgare) infection. The ability of RcCDI1 and its homologues from different fungal species to induce cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana was tested following agroinfiltration or infiltration of recombinant proteins produced by Pichia pastoris. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and transient expression of Phytophthora infestans effectors PiAVR3a and PexRD2 were used to assess the involvement of known components of PTI in N. benthamiana responses to RcCDI1. RcCDI1 was highly upregulated early during barley colonization with R. commune. RcCDI1 and its homologues from different fungal species, including Zymoseptoria tritici, Magnaporthe oryzae and Neurospora crassa, exhibited PAMP activity, inducing cell death in Solanaceae but not in other families of dicots or monocots. RcCDI1-triggered cell death was shown to require N. benthamiana Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-Associated Kinase 1 (NbBAK1), N. benthamiana suppressor of BIR1-1 (NbSOBIR1) and N. benthamiana SGT1 (NbSGT1), but was not suppressed by PiAVR3a or PexRD2. We report the identification of a novel Ascomycete PAMP, RcCDI1, recognized by Solanaceae but not by monocots, which activates cell death through a pathway that is distinct from that triggered by the oomycete PAMP INF1.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancement of recombinant BmK AngM1 production in Pichia pastoris by regulating gene dosage, co-expressing with chaperones and fermenting in fed-batch mode.</h4><p>Q.

The yield of rBmK AngM1 in the four-copy strain reached up to 100 mg/L, which was further enhanced to 190 mg/L by co-expressing with chaperones of PDI, BiP, and HAC1. Moreover, the yield of rBmK AngM1 was up to 1200 mg/L by high-density fermentation in 10 L fermenter. Finally, 360 mg rBmK AngM1 was purified from 1 L cultures by a two-step purification method. The efficient and convenient techniques presented in this study could facilitate further scale-up for industrial production of rBmK AngM1.</p></details><hr><h4>Effects of UPR and ERAD pathway on the prolyl endopeptidase production in Pichia pastoris by controlling of nitrogen source.</h4><p>X.

Pichia pastoris has been used for the PEP production; however, the fermentation process has not be investigated and little is known about the impact of excessive PEP production on the host cell physiology. Here, we optimized the nitrogen source to improve the PEP expression level and further evaluated the cellular response including UPR and ERAD. During methanol induction phase the PEP activity (1583 U/L) was increased by 1.48-fold under the optimized nitrogen concentration of NH4+ (300 mmol/L) and casamino acids [1.0% (w/v)] in a 3-L bioreactor. Evaluated by RT-PCR the UPR and ERAD pathways were confirmed to be activated. Furthermore, a strong decrease of ERAD-related gene transcription was observed with the addition of nitrogen source, which contributed to a higher PEP expression level.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcription factor Mxr1 promotes the expression of Aox1 by repressing glycerol transporter 1 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

In this study, the relationship between alcohol oxidase 1 (aox1), methanol expression regulator 1 (mxr1) and glycerol transporter 1 (gt1) was studied. By RT-PCR, it was found that the overexpression of gt1 could increase the glycerol content in cells and repress the expression of mxr1 and aox1, and the deletion of gt1 reduced the glycerol content in cells and promoted the expression of aox1. The overexpression of mxr1 could repress the expression of gt1, and the deletion of mxr1 could promote the expression of gt1 to some extent. By EMSA, Mxr1 binding sites were found in the promoter of gt1 (PGt1) (-141 to -138, CCCC), and Mxr1 could regulate the expression of gt1 by binding to PGt1. The relationships among aox1, mxr1 and gt1 revealed here provide a reference for the understanding of the mechanism of glycerol repression of PAox1.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of maize chitinase-A, a tough allergenic molecule.</h4><p>M.

Proteins commonly identified as food allergens tend to have one of about 30 different biochemical activities. This leads to the assumption that food allergens must have specific structural features which causes their allergenicity. But these structural features are not completely understood. Uncovering the structural basis of allergenicity would allow improved diagnosis and therapy of allergies and would provide insights for safer food production. The availability of recombinant food allergens can accelerate their structural analysis and benefit specific studies in allergology. Plant chitinases are an example of food allergenic proteins for which structural analysis of allergenicity has only partially been reported. The recombinant maize chitinase, rChiA, was purified from Pichia pastoris extracellular medium by differential precipitation and cation exchange chromatography. Enzyme activity was evaluated by halo-assays and microcalorimetric procedures. rChiA modeling was performed by a two-step procedure, using the Swiss-Model server and Modeller software. Allergenicity of rChiA was verified by immunoblot assays with sera from allergic subjects. rChiA is active in the hydrolysis of glycol chitin and tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose and maintains its activity at high temperatures (70 degrees C) and low pH (pH 3). The molecule is also reactive with IgE from sera of maize-allergic subjects. rChiA is a valuable molecule for further studies on structure-allergenicity relationships and as a tool for diagnosing allergies.</p></details><hr><h4>Isolation and characterization of human CapG expressed and post-translationally modified in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A.

We successfully expressed human CapG in the wild type strain X-33 of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), which does not express endogenous CapG, in order to characterize this protein in more detail. After mechanical cell lysis, debris was centrifuged and the soluble protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. This protein pellet was dialyzed and used for CapG purification. Ca2+-dependent exposure of hydrophobic sites allowed single step and selective elution from a Phenyl Sepharose matrix. 3.5 mg CapG/10 g wet biomass were isolated and showed a Ca2+-sensitive and dose-dependent capping activity of actin in a fluorometric assay. In P. pastoris, CapG is located at actin patches, actin cables and arranges along the budding neck. The proliferation rate and morphology of the yeast cells are not influenced by the interaction of CapG with actin. The modification pattern of human CapG from P. pastoris and human carcinoma cells is highly similar. We validated most of the known post-translational modifications and found three new phosphorylation and nine new acetylation sites by mass spectrometry. The N-terminus is acetylated or truncated. Truncated CapG is not phosphorylated at the residues S10, T212 and S337. First mutagenesis experiments indicate an N-terminal acetylation dependent C-terminal phosphorylation.</p></details><hr><h4>VSV-G Viral Envelope Glycoprotein Prepared from Pichia pastoris Enhances Transfection of DNA into Animal Cells.</h4><p>X.

The objective of this study was to establish a potential approach for large-scale production of VSV-G. To this end, VSV-G was cloned with an N-terminal His-tag into Pichia pastoris expression vector pPIC3.5K. Three clones (Muts) containing the VSV-G expression cassette were identified by PCR. All clones proliferated normally in expansion medium, whereas the proliferation was reduced significantly under induction conditions. VSV-G protein was detected in cell lysates by western blot analysis, and the highest expression level was observed at 96 h post induction. VSV-G could also be obtained from the condition medium of yeast protoplasts. Furthermore, VSV-G could be incorporated into Ad293 cells and was able to induce cell fusion, leading to the transfer of cytoplasmic protein. Finally, VSV-G-mediated DNA transfection was assayed by flow cytometry and luciferase measurement. Incubation of VSV-G lysate with the pGL3-control DNA complex increased the luciferase activity in Ad293 and HeLa cells by about 3-fold. Likewise, incubation of VSV-G lysate with the pCMV-DsRed DNA complex improved the transfection efficiency into Ad293 by 10% and into HeLa cells by about 1-fold. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that VSV-G could be produced from P. pastoris with biofunctionalities, demonstrating that large-scale production of the viral glycoprotein is feasible.</p></details><hr><h4>Expanding the feruloyl esterase gene family of Aspergillus niger by characterization of a feruloyl esterase, FaeC.</h4><p>A.

FaeC was most active at pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, and showed broad substrate specificity and catalyzed the hydrolysis of methyl 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate, ethyl ferulate, methyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, ethyl coumarate, methyl sinapate, and methyl caffeate. The enzyme released both ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from wheat arabinoxylan and sugar beet pectin (up to 3mg/g polysaccharide), and acted synergistically with a commercial xylanase increasing the release of ferulic acid up to six-fold. The expression of faeC increased over time in the presence of feruloylated polysaccharides. Cinnamic, syringic, caffeic, vanillic and ferulic acid induced the expression of faeC. Overall expression of faeC was very low in all tested conditions, compared to two other A. niger FAE encoding genes, faeA and faeB. Our data showed that the fae genes responded differently towards the feruloylated polysaccharides and tested monomeric phenolic compounds suggesting that the corresponding FAE isoenzymes may target different substrates in a complementary manner. This may increase the efficiency of the degradation of diverse plant biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioactivity studies of Huh-7 cells derived human epidermal growth factor expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE separated extracellular proteins from hEGF recombinant Pichia pastoris strain indicated that about 84% of the extracellular proteins were glycosylated. Size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75 prep grade column was successfully utilized to separate fractions containing glycosylated and non-glycosylated extracellular proteins. In dot blot assay, hEGF was detected in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions. Bioactivity assays revealed that both glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions were bioactive as determined by cell viability assay. It was also observed that hEGF present in non-glycosylated fraction was relatively more bioactive than hEGF present in glycosylated fraction.</p></details><hr><h4>Biotransformation of menadione to its prenylated derivative MK-3 using recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Z.

In this study, NovQ was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. After fermentation optimization, NovQ production increased by 1617%. Then the different effects of metal ions, detergents and pH on the activity of purified NovQ were investigated to optimize the prenylation reaction. Finally, purified NovQ and cells containing NovQ were used for menadione prenylation in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Menaquinone-1 (MK-1) was detected as the only product in vitro with gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and menadione hydroquinol substrates. MK-3 at a concentration of 90.53 mg/L was detected as the major product of whole cell catalysis with 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and menadione hydroquinol substrates.

A putative endo-polygalacturonase gene PoxaEnPG28A was cloned from Penicillium oxalicum CZ1028. PoxaEnPG28A consisted of a putative signal peptide and a catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 28, and it shared 72% identity with that of a functionally characterized endo-polygalacturonase from Trichoderma harzianum. Gene PoxaEnPG28A was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris with a high yield of 1828.7 U/mL. The purified recombinant enzyme PoxaEnPG28A hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in endo-manner releasing oligo-galacturonates. PoxaEnPG28A showed maximal activity at pH 5.5 and 55 degrees C, and was stable between pH 3.0 to 10.0 and below 45 degrees C. The kinetic constants Km and Vmax of PoxaEnPG28A were calculated as 1.57 g/L and 14,641.29 U/mg, respectively. PoxaEnPG28A significantly improved the yields of fruit juices from banana, plantain, papaya, pitaya and mango. The high production level of the recombinant enzyme PoxaEnPG28A by P. pastoris and remarkable catalytic activity of PoxaEnPG28A toward five kinds of fruit juices made the enzyme a potential application in agriculture and food industries.</p></details><hr><h4>A Modular Toolkit for Generating Pichia pastoris Secretion Libraries.</h4><p>U. Obst, T. K. Lu, V.

For large-scale industrial production, secretion of a protein offers the advantage of simple and efficient downstream purification that avoids costly cell rupture, denaturation and refolding. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffi) is a well-established expression host that has the ability to perform post-translational modifications and is generally regarded as safe (GRAS). Nevertheless, optimization of protein secretion in this host remains a challenge due to the multiple steps involved during secretion and a lack of genetic tools to tune this process. Here, we developed a toolkit of standardized regulatory elements specific for Pichia pastoris allowing the tuning of gene expression and choice of protein secretion tag. As protein secretion is a complex process, these parts are compatible with a hierarchical assembly method to enable the generation of large and diverse secretion libraries in order to explore a wide range of secretion constructs, achieve successful secretion, and better understand the regulatory factors of importance to specific proteins of interest. To assess the performance of these parts, we built and characterized the expression and secretion efficiency of 124 constructs that combined different regulatory elements with two fluorescent reporter proteins (RFP, yEGFP). Intracellular expression from our promoters was comparatively independent of whether RFP or yEGFP, and whether plasmid-based expression or genomically integrated expression, was used. In contrast, secretion efficiency significantly varied for different genes expressed using identical regulatory elements, with differences in secretion efficiency of >10-fold observed. These results highlight the importance of generating diverse secretion libraries when searching for optimal expression conditions, and demonstrate that our toolkit is a valuable asset for the creation of efficient microbial cell factories.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Helicoverpa armigera cytochrome P450 CYP6B7 in Pichia pastoris and interactions of CYP6B7 with insecticides.</h4><p>C.

A vector pPICZA-HaCYP6B7 was constructed and transformed into P. pastoris GS115, the transformant of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-GS115 was then cultured and induced by 1% (v/v) methanol and the heterologous expression of HaCYP6B7 protein in P. pastoris was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Microsomes containing the expressed HaCYP6B7 showed activities against model substrate p-nitroanisole and 7-ethoxycoumarin, with p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (PNOD) and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD) activities of 15.66- and 4.75-fold of the control, respectively. Moreover, it showed degradation activities against the insecticides bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos, with clearance activities of 6.88-, 1.49- and 2.27-fold of the control, respectively. The interactions of HaCYP6B7 with insecticides were further confirmed by molecular docking in silico with binding scores of 5.450, 5.295 and 2.197 between putative HaCYP6B7 protein and bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos, respectively.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The results of present study provided more direct and important evidence on the role of HaCYP6B7 conferring pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera.

Linke, R. G. Berger, N Biotechnol 37 153 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159727>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extracellular esterase activity was detected in submerged cultures of Rhizoctonia solani grown in the presence of sugar beet pectin or Tween 80. Putative type B feruloyl esterase (FAE) coding sequences found in the genome data of the basidiomycete were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant enzyme production on the 5-L bioreactor scale (Rs p</p><p><strong>CAE:</strong> 3245UL-1) exceeded the productivity of the wild type strain by a factor of 800. Based on substrate specificity profiling, the purified recombinant Rs pCAE was classified as a p-coumaroyl esterase (pCAE) with a pronounced chlorogenic acid esterase side activity. The Rs pCAE was also active on methyl cinnamate, caffeate and ferulate and on feruloylated saccharides. The unprecedented substrate profile of Rs pCAE together with the lack of sequence similarity to known FAEs or pCAEs suggested that the Rs pCAE represents a new type of enzyme. Hydroxycinnamic acids were released from agro-industrial side-streams, such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB), sugar beet pectin (SBP) and coffee pulp (CP). Overnight incubation of coffee pulp with the Rs pCAE resulted in the efficient release of p-coumaric (100%), caffeic (100%) and ferulic acid (85%) indicating possible applications for the valorization of food processing wastes and for the enhanced degradation of lignified biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory Expression and Characterization of Chinese Narcissus GNA-Like Lectin in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X. Li et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 182 1433 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130769>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Narcissus tazetta lectin (NTL) is a GNA-like lectin, which has a wide potential application in medicine, agriculture, and glycobiology. In the present paper, the codon-optimized ntl gene was transformed into the yeast Pichia pastoris; SDS-PAGE gel and western blotting analysis revealed that the recombinant lectin was expressed successfully in Pichia yeast. The similarity between the recombinant NTL and the native NTL was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and hemagglutination assay further. In the 5-L scale fermentator, the protein yield was as high as 1.2 g/L after fermentation for 96 h. In addition, the effect of metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cu2+), acid, and alkaline on hemagglutinating activity of NTL was tested, which provided biochemical characterizations of the mannose-binding lectin from Chinese Narcissus.</p></details><hr><h4>A Recombinant Highly Thermostable beta-Mannanase (ReTMan26) from Thermophilic Bacillus subtilis (TBS2) Expressed in Pichia pastoris and Its pH and Temperature Stability.</h4><p>Z. Luo et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 182 1259 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28101787>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A gene encoding a highly thermostable beta-mannanase from a thermophilic Bacillus subtilis (TBS2) was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. The maximum activity of the recombinant thermostable beta-mannanase (ReTMan26) was 5435 U/mL, which was obtained by high-density, fed-batch cultivation after 168-h induction with methanol in a 50-L bioreactor. The protein yield reached 3.29 mg/mL, and the protein had a molecular weight of ~42 kDa. After fermentation, ReTMan26 was purified using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane and Sephadex G-75 column. The pH and temperature optima of purified ReTMan26 were pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively, and the enzyme was stable at pH 2.0-8.0 and was active at 20-100 degrees C. HPLC analysis of the products of locust bean gum hydrolysis showed that the mannan-oligosaccharide content was 62.5%. ReTMan26 retained 58.6% of its maximum activity after treatment at 100 degrees C for 10 min, which was higher than any other beta-mannanase reported up to now, suggesting its potential for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Matchout deuterium labelling of proteins for small-angle neutron scattering studies using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems and high cell-density cultures.</h4><p>O. Dunne et al., Eur Biophys J 46 425 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27844110>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a powerful technique for the characterisation of macromolecular structures and interactions. Its main advantage over other solution state approaches is the ability to use D2O/H2O solvent contrast variation to selectively match out specific parts of a multi-component system. While proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids are readily distinguished in this way, it is not possible to locate different parts of a protein-protein system without the introduction of additional contrast by selective deuteration. Here, we describe new methods by which 'matchout labelled' proteins can be produced using Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris expression systems in high cell-density cultures. The method is designed to produce protein that has a scattering length density that is very close to that of 100% D2O, providing clear contrast when used with hydrogenated partner proteins in a complex. This allows the production of a single sample system for which SANS measurements at different solvent contrasts can be used to distinguish and model the hydrogenated component, the deuterated component, and the whole complex. The approach, which has significant cost advantages, has been extensively tested for both types of expression system.</p></details>
