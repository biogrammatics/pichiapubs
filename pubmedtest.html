L. Arneaud, J. R. Porter, Mol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26289300>pubmed link</a></p><p>Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is a plant natural product that serves as a precursor for the synthesis of many well-known chemotherapeutic drugs. The limited availability and high demand for the source plants of PPT have led to the exploration of alternative sources for this compound. In this study, we utilized the endophytic fungus Phialocephala podophylli (strain PPE7) that we isolated from the rhizomes of Podophyllum peltatum and is known to produce detectable amounts of PPT in broth culture. To date, the complete PPT biosynthetic pathway has yet to be determined in any species. Since fungi are well known for clustering genes that belong to secondary metabolite pathways, use of a fungal system for investigation of the PPT biosynthesis genes may ultimately lead to elucidation of the entire pathway. In this study, we investigated the secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SD) gene that facilitates the dehydrogenation of secoisolariciresinol to form matairesinol, a mid-pathway intermediate product in PPT biosynthesis. We utilized PCR amplification to acquire the complete SD gene sequence in PPE7 and opted to synthesize the P. peltatum SD sequence for expression. Through western blotting, we confirmed the expression of the recombinant SD (PpSD) and verified protein functionality with a bioconversion assay followed by HPLC and LC-MS analyses. Here, we report the identification of the SD gene in PPE7; this is the first report of the SD gene in an endophytic fungus. Additionally, we established the groundwork for the future expression of the complete PPT biosynthetic pathway in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris.</p><hr><h4>Recombinant Expression of Trichoderma reesei Cel61A in Pichia pastoris: Optimizing Yield and N-terminal Processing.</h4><p>M. Tanghe et al., Mol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26285758>pubmed link</a></p><p>The auxiliary activity family 9 (AA9, formerly GH61) harbors a recently discovered group of oxidative enzymes that boost cellulose degradation. Indeed, these lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are able to disrupt the crystalline structure of cellulose, thereby facilitating the work of hydrolytic enzymes involved in biomass degradation. Since these enzymes require an N-terminal histidine residue for activity, their recombinant production as secreted protein is not straightforward. We here report the expression optimization of Trichoderma reesei Cel61A (TrCel61A) in the host Pichia pastoris. The use of the native TrCel61A secretion signal instead of the alpha-mating factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be crucial, not only to obtain high protein yields (>400 mg/L during fermentation) but also to enable the correct processing of the N-terminus. Furthermore, the LPMO activity of the enzyme is demonstrated here for the first time, based on its degradation profile of a cellulosic substrate.</p><hr><h4>Reaction of pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus meleagris with its carbohydrate substrates.</h4><p>M. M. Graf et al., FEBS J   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26284701>pubmed link</a></p><p>Monomeric Agaricus meleagris pyranose dehydrogenase (AmPDH) belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of oxidoreductases. An FAD cofactor is covalently tethered to His-103 of the enzyme. AmPDH can double oxidize various mono- and oligosaccharides at different positions (C1 to C4). To study the structure/function relationship of selected active-site residues of AmPDH pertaining to substrate (carbohydrate) turnover in more detail, several active-site variants were generated, heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized by biochemical, biophysical, and computational means. The crystal structure of AmPDH shows two active-site histidines, both of which could take on the role as the catalytic base in the reductive half-reaction. Steady-state kinetics revealed that His-512 is the only catalytic base, since H512A showed a reduction in (kcat /KM )glucose by a factor of 105 , while this catalytic efficiency was reduced by 2-3 orders of magnitude for His-556 variants (H556A, H556N). This was further corroborated by transient-state kinetics, where a comparable decrease in the reductive rate constant was observed for H556A, while the rate constant for the oxidative half-reaction (using benzoquinone as substrate) was increased for H556A compared to recombinant wild-type AmPDH. Steady-state kinetics furthermore indicated that Gln-392, Tyr-510, Val-511 and His-556 are important for the catalytic efficiency of PDH. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations were used to predict d-glucose oxidation sites, which were validated by GC-MS measurements. These simulations also suggest that van der Waals interactions are the main driving force for substrate recognition and binding. This article is protected by copyright.

Garcia-Ortega, C. Reyes, J. L. Montesinos, F. Valero, Front Bioeng Biotechnol 3 107 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26284241>pubmed link</a></p><p>The most commonly used cell disruption procedures may present lack of reproducibility, which introduces significant errors in the quantification of intracellular components. In this work, an approach consisting in the definition of an overall key performance indicator (KPI) was implemented for a lab scale high-pressure homogenizer (HPH) in order to determine the disruption settings that allow the reliable quantification of a wide sort of intracellular components. This innovative KPI was based on the combination of three independent reporting indicators: decrease of absorbance, release of total protein, and release of alkaline phosphatase activity. The yeast Pichia pastoris growing on methanol was selected as model microorganism due to it presents an important widening of the cell wall needing more severe methods and operating conditions than Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From the outcome of the reporting indicators, the cell disruption efficiency achieved using HPH was about fourfold higher than other lab standard cell disruption methodologies, such bead milling cell permeabilization. This approach was also applied to a pilot plant scale HPH validating the methodology in a scale-up of the disruption process. This innovative non-complex approach developed to evaluate the efficacy of a disruption procedure or equipment can be easily applied to optimize the most common disruption processes, in order to reach not only reliable quantification but also recovery of intracellular components from cell factories of interest.</p><hr><h4>Expression of feruloyl esterase A from Aspergillus terreus and its application in biomass degradation.</h4><p>S. B. Zhang et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282562>pubmed link</a></p><p>Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are key enzymes involved in the complete biodegradation of lignocelluloses, which could hydrolyze the ester bonds between hemicellulose and lignin. The coding sequence of a feruloyl esterase A (AtFaeA) was cloned from Aspergillus terreus and the recombinant AtFaeA was constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris. The SDS-PAGE analysis of purified AtFaeA showed two protein bands owing to the different extent of glycosylation, and the recombinant AtFaeA had an optimum temperature of 50 degrees C and an optimum pH of 5.0. The substrate utilization and primary sequence identity of AtFaeA demonstrated that it is a type-A feruloyl esterase. The hydrolysis of corn stalk and corncob by xylanase from A. niger could be significantly improved in concert with recombinant AfFaeA.</p><hr><h4>beta-Lactoglobulin mutant Lys69Asn has attenuated IgE and increased retinol binding activity.</h4><p>N. T. Koupaie, A. Taheri-Kafrani, T. Haertle, J Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26281976>pubmed link</a></p><p>beta-Lactoglobulin (beta-LG) is a member of lipocalin superfamily of transporters for small hydrophobic molecules such as retinoids, fatty acids, drugs, and vitamins. beta-LG also is one of the major allergens in milk. Despite a lot of research on decreasing cow's milk allergenicity, the effects of mutations of beta-LG on recognition by IgE from cow's milk allergy (CMA) patients have not been investigated. We describe here the expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris of a mutant bovine beta-LG, in which lysine at position 69, in the main epitopes of the protein, was changed into asparagine (Lys69Asn). The purity and native like folded structure of the recombinant Lys69Asn beta-LG was confirmed by HPLC, SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and circular dichroism. Lys69Asn beta-LG has a fourfold stronger affinity than the wild-type protein for retinol, palmitic acid, and resveratrol, as determined by quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. At the same time the Lys69Asn mutant had a 9 fold attenuated, compared with the wild-type, affinity for IgE of sera from patients suffering from cow's milk allergy, whereas no difference could be detected between mutant and wild-type for binding of the IgGs of four monoclonal antibodies. The results of this study demonstrated the significant role of Lys69 residue on the binding and immuoreactivity properties of beta-LG.</p><hr><h4>Inhibition of Melanogenesis by Yeast Extracts from Cultivations of Recombinant Pichia pastoris Catalyzing ortho-Hydroxylation of Flavonoids.</h4><p>T. S. Chang, B. D, G. J, Curr Pharm Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26278529>pubmed link</a></p><p>The inhibition of melanogenesis by yeast extracts from cultivations of recombinant Pichia pastoris catalyzing ortho-hydroxylation of flavonoids was investigated. The recombinant yeast harbored a fusion gene composed of the CYP57B3 gene from Aspergillus oryzae and a cytochrome reductase gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ten flavonoids belonging to flavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanols, and isoflavones were evaluated for biotransformation by the recombinant strain. The results showed that five flavonoids, including the flavone apigenin, the flavanones naringenin and liquiritigenin, and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein, could be biotransformed. The yeast extracts from the five biotransformation fermentations were then evaluated for inhibitory activity on melanogenesis in cultured mouse B16 melanoma cells. Three yeast extracts from biotransformation fermentation feeding with daidzein, genistein, or apigenin showed inhibitory activity on melanogenesis in the B16 cells, while the extract from genistein biotransformation exhibited the highest activity. The yeast extract from genistein biotransformation also showed inhibitory activity on cellular tyrosinase activity in the B16 cells. The present study shows a CYP with multiple flavonoid substrates for the first time and highlights the usage of yeast extracts from cultivations of the recombinant yeast catalyzing flavonoids' biotransformation in the development of skin-whitening agents.</p><hr><h4>Characterization of a new family 75 chitosanase from Aspergillus sp. W-2.</h4><p>J. Zhang et al., Int J Biol Macromol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277746>pubmed link</a></p><p>A new chitosanase gene of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 75, csnw2, was cloned from an isolated strain Aspergillus sp. W-2 (CGMCC7018). The mature CsnW2 protein, fused to His-tag at C-terminus, was expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 and purified with the affinity chromatography of Ni2+-NTA. The novel recombinant CsnW2 showed maximal activity with chitosan at pH 6.0 and 55 degrees C. Moreover, it had good pH stability and thermostability at a broad pH range of 3.0-10.0 and a temperature range of 30-70 degrees C, respectively. The enzymatic activity of the CsnW2 could be significantly enhanced by Ca2+, Mn2+ and Mg2+ at a concentration of 1mM, but strongly inhibited by Fe2+, Zn2+, Ge2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ above 1mM. The CsnW2 showed specific hydrolytic activity against chitosan and preferred to hydrolyze chitosan with high degree of deacetylation. The main products of chtiosan (92% deacetylation) were chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) with degree of polymerization (DP) arranging from 2 to 6. Combined with the hydrolysis of COS from DP2 to DP6, CsnW2 was considered to be an endo-acting chitosanase.</p><hr><h4>Generation of recombinant destabilase-lysozyme from medicinal leeches in three different expression systems.</h4><p>V.

Lazarev, Protein Expr Purif   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277552>pubmed link</a></p><p>Destabilase-lysozyme (mlDL) is an enzyme secreted by the salivary gland cells of medicinal leeches. Destabilase-lysozyme possesses lysozyme and isopeptidase activities. We generated recombinant destabilase-lysozyme isoform 2 in three expression systems, i.e., in the bacteria Escherichia coli, in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and in the human cell line Expi293F. In E. coli, we generated both polypeptide in inclusion bodies that was later undergone to the refolding and soluble protein that had been fused with the chaperone SlyD. The chaperone was later cleaved by a specific TEV-protease. In cultures of the yeast P. pastoris and the human cell line Expi293F, the soluble form of destabilase-lysozyme was accumulated in the culture media. For the generated enzymes, we determined the lysozyme, isopeptidase and fibrinolytic activities and tested their general antimicrobial effects. The comparisons of the enzymes generated in the different expression systems revealed that all of the destabilase-lysozymes obtained in the soluble forms possessed equal levels of lysozyme, isopeptidase and fibrinolytic activities that exceeded several to ten times the levels of the same activities of the destabilase-lysozyme renaturated from the inclusion bodies. A similar pattern of the differences in the levels of the general antimicrobial effects was observed for the destabilase-lysozymes generated in the soluble form and as inclusion bodies.</p><hr><h4>Enhanced Anti-Tumor (Anti-Proliferation) Activity of Recombinant Human Interleukin-29 (IL-29) Mutants Using Site-Directed Mutagenesis Method.</h4><p>Y. Lu, L. Li, W. Chen, M. Wu, Appl Biochem Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277192>pubmed link</a></p><p>Interferon (IFN)-lambda, also known as IL-28A, IL-28B, or IL-29, is a new type III IFN, which shares many functional characteristics with type I IFN (alpha/beta). Currently, IFN-alpha is used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer with severe adverse effects. Some researches had stated that IFN-lambdas induced a similar but restricted growth inhibition of tumor cells relative to IFN-alpha; moreover, mutations of IFN-lambdas could strongly impact its biological properties. In this study, three hIL-29 mutants (K33R, R35K, and K33R/R35K) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and efficiently expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, which have considerable abilities to inhibit the growth of BEL-7402, HCT-8, and SGC-7901 tumor cells in vitro. The results showed that these mutants (K33R, R35K, and K33R/R35K) exhibited a significantly enhanced anti-proliferation activity against these tumor cells, compared with native hIL-29 in vitro. Further assay in vitro indicated that superior to K33R and R35K, K33R/R35K had a significant increase in anti-tumor activity compared with IFN-alpha2b, which suggested that the K33R/R35K could make improvement for the effectiveness of native hIL-29 in clinic and could be used as a potentially powerful candidate for cancer immunotherapy.</p><hr><h4>The Ala86Gln mutant beta-lactoglobulin has increased ligand binding and decreased immunoreactivity properties.</h4><p>N. Kazem-Farzandi, A. Taheri-Kafrani, T. Haertle, Int J Biol Macromol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26275462>pubmed link</a></p><p>beta-Lactoglobulin (beta-LG) is a member of lipocalin superfamily of transporters for small hydrophobic molecules. beta-LG is also one of the major allergens in milk. Despite a lot of researches on decreasing of cow's milk allergenicity, the effects of the mutation of beta-LG on its recognition by IgE from cow's milk allergy (CMA) patients have not been investigated. We described here the expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris of a mutant beta-LG, in which Alanine86 was changed into Glutamine (Ala86Gln; a mutation on one of the major epitopes of the protein). The purity and native like folded structure of the recombinant Ala86Gln have been demonstrated using circular dichroism, HPLC, SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The effect of the mutation on the binding of IgE from CMA patients to mutant protein was evaluated by ELISA methods and the results showed that the mutation of Ala86 was associated with weaker binding of IgE from CMA patients to Ala86Gln mutant protein. Subsequently, the binding of various ligands such as retinol, palmitic acid, resveratrol and serotonin, with native, recombinant wild type and Ala86Gln mutant beta-LGs were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and an improvement on the binding affinity of the mutated protein to various ligands was observed.</p><hr><h4>Heterologous production of a feruloyl esterase from Pleurotus sapidus synthesizing feruloyl-saccharide esters.</h4><p>S. Kelle et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272349>pubmed link</a></p><p>The feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene EST1 from the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Catalytically active recombinant Est1 was secreted using P. pastoris as a host. For expression in P. pastoris, the expression vector pPIC9K was applied. The EST1-gene was cloned with an N-terminal alpha-mating factor pre-pro sequence and expressed under the control of a methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promotor. Est1 was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant Est1 showed optima at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C and released ferulic acid from saccharide esters and from the natural substrate destarched wheat bran (DSWB). Substrate specificity profile and descriptor based analysis demonstrated unique properties, showing that Est1 did not fit into the current FAE classification model. Transferuloylation synthesis of feruloyl-saccharide esters was proven for mono- and disaccharides. This article is protected by copyright.

Yin et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26266754>pubmed link</a></p><p>Feruloyl or ferulic acid esterase (Fae, EC 3.1.1.73) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester bonds between polysaccharides and phenolic acid compounds in xylan side chain. In this study, the thermostability of a type A feruloyl esterase (AuFaeA) from Aspergillus usamii was increased by iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM). Two amino acids, Ser33 and Asn92, were selected for saturation mutagenesis according to the B-factors analyzed by B-FITTER software and DeltaDeltaG values predicted by PoPMuSiC algorithm. After screening the saturation mutagenesis libraries constructed in Pichia pastoris, 15 promising variants were obtained. The best variant S33E/N92-4 (S33E/N92R) produced a T m value of 44.5 degrees C, the half-lives (t 1/2) of 35 and 198 min at 55 and 50 degrees C, respectively, corresponding to a 4.7 degrees C, 2.33- and 3.96-fold improvement compared to the wild type. Additionally, the best S33 variant S33-6 (S33E) was thermostable at 50 degrees C with a t 1/2 of 82 min, which was 32 min longer than that of the wild type. All the screened S33E/N92 variants were more thermostable than the best S33 variant S33-6 (S33E). This work would contribute to the further studies on higher thermostability modification of type A feruloyl esterases, especially those from fungi. The thermostable feruloyl esterase variants were expected to be potential candidates for industrial application in prompting the enzymic degradation of plant biomass materials at elevated temperatures.</p><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of a cellobiohydrolase (CBH7B) from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. S. Woon et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26265428>pubmed link</a></p><p>The gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase (CBH7B) of the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris was identified, sub-cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. CBH7B encoded 455 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 51.8 kD. Domain analysis indicated that CBH7B contains a family 7 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic core but lacks a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). Purified CBH7B exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C with methylumbelliferryl-cellobioside (MUC) as the substrate and retained 85% of its activity following 24 h incubation at 50 degrees C. Despite the lack of activity towards microcrystalline substrates, this enzyme worked synergistically with the commercial enzyme cocktail Cellic(R) CTec2 to enhance saccharification by 39% when added to a reaction mixture containing 0.25% alkaline pretreated oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy suggested a reduction of lignin and crystalline cellulose in OPEFB samples supplemented with CBH7B. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed greater destruction extent of OPEFB strands in samples supplemented with CBH7B as compared to the non-supplemented control. CBH7B therefore has the potential to complement commercial enzymes in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass. This article is protected by copyright.

Joshi, T. Satyanarayana, J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264930>pubmed link</a></p><p>The phytase of the yeast Pichia anomala (PPHY) is a suitable biocatalyst as a food and feed additive because of its adequate thermostability, acid stability, protease insensitivity and broad substrate spectrum. The cell-bound nature and low phytase titres are the main bottlenecks for its utility in food and feed industries. In this investigation, we have overcome the problems by constitutive secretory expression of PPHY under glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter. A ~44-fold increase in rPPHY titre has been achieved after optimization of cultural variables by one-variable-at-a-time approach and two factorial statistical design. The use of GAP promoter makes the cultivation of the recombinant P. pastoris straight forward and eliminates the requirement of methanol for induction and hazards associated with its storage. Among metal-phytate complexes, Ca2+ phytate is hydrolyzed more efficiently by rPPHY than Co2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+ phytates. The enzyme is effective in dephytinizing whole wheat unleavened flat Indian breads (naan and tandoori) and different broiler feeds, thus mitigating anti-nutritional effects of phytates.</p><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of manganese lipoxygenase of the rice blast fungus reveals prominent sequential lipoxygenation of alpha-linolenic acid.</h4><p>A. Wennman, F. Jerneren, A. Magnuson, E. H. Oliw, Arch Biochem Biophys 583 87 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264916>pubmed link</a></p><p>Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast disease and has become a model organism of fungal infections. M. oryzae can oxygenate fatty acids by 7,8-linoleate diol synthase, 10R-dioxygenase-epoxy alcohol synthase, and by a putative manganese lipoxygenase (Mo-MnLOX). The latter two are transcribed during infection. The open reading frame of Mo-MnLOX was deduced from genome and cDNA analysis. Recombinant Mo-MnLOX was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme contained protein-bound Mn and oxidized 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 to 9S-, 11-, and 13R-hydroperoxy metabolites by suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. The 11-hydroperoxides were subject to beta-fragmentation with formation of 9S- and 13R-hydroperoxy fatty acids. Oxygen consumption indicated apparent kcat values of 2.8 s-1 (18:2n-6) and 3.9 s-1 (18:3n-3), and UV analysis yielded apparent Km values of 8 and 12 muM, respectively, for biosynthesis of cis-trans conjugated metabolites. 9S-Hydroperoxy-10E,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid was rapidly further oxidized to a triene, 9S,16S-dihydroperoxy-10E,12Z,14E-octadecatrienoic acid. In conclusion, we have expressed, purified and characterized a new MnLOX from M. oryzae. The pathogen likely secretes Mo-MnLOX and phospholipases to generate oxylipins and to oxidize lipid membranes of rice cells and the cuticle.</p><hr><h4>Expression, purification and initial characterization of human meprin beta from Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D. Schlenzig et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26256061>pubmed link</a></p><p>Human meprin beta (h-meprin beta), a single-zinc metalloendoprotease of the astacin family, is potentially involved in disorders such as fibrosis and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we describe the expression of the enzyme in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The N-terminal signal sequence was replaced by the alpha-leader of Saccharomyces, enabling efficient secretion of the mature enzyme, harboring either an N-terminal or C-terminal His-tag. The purification by affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography resulted in isolation of 58.4mg/l of homogenous human pro-meprin beta from fermentation broth. The activated enzyme isolated from yeast (yh-meprin beta) displayed virtually identical enzymatic activity as h-meprin from a mammalian cell line. Furthermore, the yh-meprin beta was N-glycosylated and secreted as a dimer with a molecular mass of 148kDa. Endoglycosidase H treatment generated a protein with a molecular mass of 133kDa, but essentially unchanged kinetic parameters. Thus, our data suggest that human meprin beta expressed in P. pastoris displays virtually identical parameters as meprin from other sources. The high yield of protein expression, the ease of purification and the deglycosylation in its native state appear to favor further studies aiming at inhibitor screening and structure-based inhibitor refinement.</p><hr><h4>In silico model-driven cofactor engineering strategies for improving the overall NADP(H) turnover in microbial cell factories.</h4><p>M. Lakshmanan, K. Yu, L. Koduru, D. Y. Lee, J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26254041>pubmed link</a></p><p>Optimizing the overall NADPH turnover is one of the key challenges in various value-added biochemical syntheses. In this work, we first analyzed the NADPH regeneration potentials of common cell factories, including Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, and Pichia pastoris across multiple environmental conditions and determined E. coli and glycerol as the best microbial chassis and most suitable carbon source, respectively. In addition, we identified optimal cofactor specificity engineering (CSE) enzyme targets, whose cofactors when switched from NAD(H) to NADP(H) improve the overall NADP(H) turnover. Among several enzyme targets, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was recognized as a global candidate since its CSE improved the NADP(H) regeneration under most of the conditions examined. Finally, by analyzing the protein structures of all CSE enzyme targets via homology modeling, we established that the replacement of conserved glutamate or aspartate with serine in the loop region could change the cofactor dependence from NAD(H) to NADP(H).</p><hr><h4>Synergistic Activity of the Plant Defensin HsAFP1 and Caspofungin against Candida albicans Biofilms and Planktonic Cultures.</h4><p>K. Vriens et al., PLoS One 10 e0132701 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26248029>pubmed link</a></p><p>Plant defensins are small, cysteine-rich peptides with antifungal activity against a broad range of yeast and fungi. In this study we investigated the antibiofilm activity of a plant defensin from coral bells (Heuchera sanguinea), i.e. HsAFP1. To this end, HsAFP1 was heterologously produced using Pichia pastoris as a host. The recombinant peptide rHsAFP1 showed a similar antifungal activity against the plant pathogen Fusarium culmorum as native HsAFP1 purified from seeds. NMR analysis revealed that rHsAFP1 consists of an alpha-helix and a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet stabilised by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. We found that rHsAFP1 can inhibit growth of the human pathogen Candida albicans as well as prevent C. albicans biofilm formation with a BIC50 (i.e. the minimum rHsAFP1 concentration required to inhibit biofilm formation by 50% as compared to control treatment) of 11.00 +/- 1.70 muM. As such, this is the first report of a plant defensin exhibiting inhibitory activity against fungal biofilms. We further analysed the potential of rHsAFP1 to increase the activity of the conventional antimycotics caspofungin and amphotericin B towards C. albicans. Synergistic effects were observed between rHsAFP1 and these compounds against both planktonic C. albicans cells and biofilms. Most notably, concentrations of rHsAFP1 as low as 0.53 muM resulted in a synergistic activity with caspofungin against pre-grown C. albicans biofilms. rHsAFP1 was found non-toxic towards human HepG2 cells up to 40 muM, thereby supporting the lack of a general cytotoxic activity as previously reported for HsAFP1. A structure-function study with 24-mer synthetic peptides spanning the entire HsAFP1 sequence revealed the importance of the gamma-core and its adjacent regions for HsAFP1 antibiofilm activity. These findings point towards broad applications of rHsAFP1 and its derivatives in the field of antifungal and antibiofilm drug development.</p><hr><h4>An artificial neural network for membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase biosynthesis with Pichia pastoris methanol-induced cultures.</h4><p>A.

Specifically, membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MBCOMT) is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the methylation of catechol substrates and has been linked to several diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia. Thereby, improvements in the clinical outcome of the therapy to these diseases may come from structure-based drug design where reaching MBCOMT samples in milligram quantities are crucial for acquiring structural information regarding this target protein. Therefore, the main aim of this work was to optimize the temperature, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) concentration and the methanol flow-rate for the biosynthesis of recombinant MBCOMT by Pichia pastoris bioreactor methanol-induced cultures using artificial neural networks (ANN).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The optimization trials intended to evaluate MBCOMT expression by P. pastoris bioreactor cultures led to the development of a first standard strategy for MBCOMT bioreactor biosynthesis with a batch growth on glycerol until the dissolved oxygen spike, 3 h of glycerol feeding and 12 h of methanol induction. The ANN modeling of the aforementioned fermentation parameters predicted a maximum MBCOMT specific activity of 384.8 nmol/h/mg of protein at 30 degrees C, 2.9 mL/L/H methanol constant flow-rate and with the addition of 6% (v/v) DMSO with almost 90% of healthy cells at the end of the induction phase. These results allowed an improvement of MBCOMT specific activity of 6.4-fold in comparison to that from the small-scale biosynthesis in baffled shake-flasks.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The ANN model was able to describe the effects of temperature, DMSO concentration and methanol flow-rate on MBCOMT specific activity, as shown by the good fitness between predicted and observed values. This experimental procedure highlights the potential role of chemical chaperones such as DMSO in improving yields of recombinant membrane proteins with a different topology than G-coupled receptors. Finally, the proposed ANN shows that the manipulation of classic fermentation parameters coupled with the addition of specific molecules can open and reinforce new perspectives in the optimization of P. pastoris bioprocesses for membrane proteins biosynthesis.</p><hr><h4>Production of a modified peptide clavanin in Pichia pastoris: cloning, expression, purification and in vitro activities.</h4><p>K. C. Mulder et al., AMB Express 5 129 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243173>pubmed link</a></p><p>Antimicrobial peptides are one of the most promising peptide-based drugs due to their enormous potential as novel biopharmaceuticals in both human and animal industries. In order to develop strategies to over produce such molecules, heterologous production of a modified version of clavanin A, here named clavanin MO (clavMO), was successfully achieved in the methylothopic yeast Pichia pastoris. ClavMO was fused to thioredoxin as a carrier protein and the construction was tested using two promoters, PAOX1 and PGAP, based on either induced or constitutive expression systems, respectively. After growth in 5 L Bioreactor, clavMO-thio was recovered and purified through size exclusion chromatography. Our findings show that both constitutive and inducible expression systems produce active clavMO fused to thioredoxin against both Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus microorganisms.</p><hr><h4>Role of residues 103,104 and 278 on the activity of SMG1 lipase from Malassezia globosa: A site-directed mutagenesis studies.</h4><p>D. Lan et al., J Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239010>pubmed link</a></p><p>SMG1 lipase from Malassezia globosa is a newly found mono- and diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase with a unique lid in loop conformation differing from the common alpha-helix lid. In the present study, we characterized the contribution of three residues, L103 and F104 in the lid, F278 in the rim of binding site groove, to the function of SMG1 lipase. Mutagenesis of these sites were conducted by site-directed mutation and each of the mutants was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, purified, and characterized for activities toward DAG and p-nitrophenol (pNP) ester. Compared to SMG1 wild type, F278A retained about 78% activity toward DAG while only 11% activity toward pNP octanoate (pNP-C8). L103G increased its activity upon pNP-C8 by about 2 folds while F104G showed about 40% decrease in pNP-C8 activity, and they both showed decreased activity upon DAG emulsion. DeleleL103-F104 retained about 30% activity toward DAG emulsion with almost completely loss of pNP-C8 activity. DeleleL103-F104 showed weaker penetration ability to a soybean phosphocholine monolayer than SMG1 WT. Based on the modulation of specificity and activity observed, a pNP-C8 binding model for ester (pNP-C8, N102 and F278 forming flexible bridge) and specific lipid-anchoring mechanism for DAG (L103 and F104 serving as "anchors" to lipid interface) were proposed.</p><hr><h4>Heterologous Expression and Characterization of a GH3 beta-Glucosidase from Thermophilic Fungi Myceliophthora thermophila in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. Zhao, C. Guo, C. Tian, Y. Ma, Appl Biochem Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234435>pubmed link</a></p><p>A novel beta-glucosidase of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 from Myceliophthora thermophila (mtbgl3b) was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. The full-length gene consists of 2613 bp nucleotides encoding a protein of 870 amino acids. MtBgl3b showed maximum activity at pH 5.0 and remained more than 70 % relative activity at 3.5-6.0. The enzyme displayed the highest activity at 60 degrees C and kept about 90 % relative activity for 50-65 degrees C; besides, the enzyme showed psychrophilic trait and remains 51 % relative activity at 40 degrees C. MtBgl3b exhibited good stability over a wide pH range of 3.0-10.0 and was thermostable at 60 and 65 degrees C. The enzyme displayed highest activity towards p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), followed by p-nitrophenyl-D-cellobioside (pNPC), cellotetraose, cellotriose, cellobiose, and gentiobiose. When using 10 % cellobiose (w/v) as the substrate, the enzyme showed transglycosylation activity to produce the cellotriose. The kinetic parametric of K m and V max were 2.78 mM and 927.9 muM mg-1 min-1, respectively. Finally, the reaction mode of the enzyme and the substrates were analyzed by molecular docking approach.</p><hr><h4>[Expression and antitumor activity of fusion protein RGD-TRAIL in Pichia pastoris].</h4><p>X. F. Wang, S. Z. Chen, Yao Xue Xue Bao 50 552 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234135>pubmed link</a></p><p>To compare the activity of RGD-TRAIL in different expression systems, RGD-TRAIL in both Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Pichia pastoris was constructed and expressed. In vitro activity of RGD-TRAIL from Pichia pastoris expression system was also analyzed. Genetic engineering techniques were used to construct recombinant plasmid pET30-rgd-trail and pHBM-rgd-trail. The recombinant protein RGD-TRAIL was purified with Ni ion affinity chromatography after induction. MTT assay, ELISA, scratch wound healing, transwell migration assay and Hoechst 33342 staining were performed to detect the effects of RGD-TRAIL on proliferation, binding activity, migration and apoptosis. The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was detected by Western blotting. Recombinant protein RGD-TRAIL was successfully expressed in a form of inclusion body in E.coli, while expressed secretorily in Pichia pastoris. It possessed more potent cytotoxicity than RGD-TRAIL in E.coli by MTT assay. The RGD-TRAIL expressed by Pichia pastoris showed powerful binding affinity with cancer cells expressing alpha(v), DR4, DR5 and highly potent cytotoxicity through inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. Nuclear fragmentation was examined by Hoechst 33342 staining. Cleaved PARP and caspase-3 were also detected after incubation with RGD-TRAIL. Additionally, RGD-TRAIL inhibited migration significantly in A549 and HT1080 cells. The results demonstrate that Pichia pastoris expression system is more suitable for the recombinant protein RGD-TRAIL. Its binding affinity and antitumor activity might make RGD-TRAIL a promising candidate for cancer therapy.</p><hr><h4>Expression of a new serine protease from Crotalus durissus collilineatus venom in Pichia pastoris and functional comparison with the native enzyme.</h4><p>J. Boldrini-Franca et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26227411>pubmed link</a></p><p>Snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs) act primarily on plasma proteins related to blood clotting and are considered promising for the treatment of several hemostatic disorders. We report the heterologous expression of a serine protease from Crotalus durissus collilineatus, named collinein-1, in Pichia pastoris, as well as the enzymatic comparative characterization of the toxin in native and recombinant forms. The complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding collinein-1 was amplified from cDNA library of C. d. collilineatus venom gland and cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector. The recombinant plasmid was used to transform cells of KM71H P. pastoris. Heterologous expression was induced by methanol and yielded 56 mg of recombinant collinein-1 (rCollinein-1) per liter of culture. The native collinein-1 was purified from C. d. collilineatus venom, and its identity was confirmed by amino acid sequencing. The native and recombinant enzymes showed similar effects upon bovine fibrinogen by releasing preferentially fibrinopeptide A. Although both enzymes have induced plasma coagulation, native Colinein-1 has shown higher coagulant activity. The serine proteases were able to hydrolyze the chromogenic substrates S-2222, S-2238, and S2302. Both enzymes showed high stability on different pH and temperature, and their esterase activities were inhibited in the presence of Zn2+ and Cu2+. The serine proteases showed similar k cat/K m values in enzyme kinetics assays, suggesting no significant differences in efficiency of these proteins to hydrolyze the substrate. These results demonstrated that rCollinein-1 was expressed with functional integrity on the evaluated parameters. The success in producing a functionally active recombinant SVSP may generate perspectives to their future therapeutic applications.</p><hr><h4>High-level expression of human arginase I in Pichia pastoris and its immobilization on chitosan to produce L-ornithine.</h4><p>X. Zhang et al., BMC Biotechnol 15 66 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26227111>pubmed link</a></p><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> L-ornithine (L-Orn), is an intermediate metabolite in the urea cycle that plays a significant role in humans. L-Orn can be obtained from the catalysis of L-arginine (L-Arg) by arginase. The Pichia pastoris expression system offers the possibility of generating a large amount of recombinant protein. The immobilized enzyme technology can overcome the difficulties in recovery, recycling and long-term stability that result from the use of free enzyme.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> The recombinant human arginase I (ARG I) was obtained using an optimized method with the Pichia pastoris GS115 as the host strain. Chitosan paticles were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and rinsed exhaustively. Then the expressed ARG I was immobilized on the crosslinked chitosan particles, and the enzymatic properties of both the free and immobilized enzymes were evaluated. At last, the immobilized ARG I was employed to catalyze L-Arg to L-Orn.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The results indicated that these two states both exhibited optimal activity under the same condition of pH10 at 40 degrees C. However, the immobilized ARG I exhibited the remarkable thermal and long-term stability as well as broad adaptability to pH, suggesting its potential for wide application in future industry. After a careful analysis of its catalytic conditions, immobilized ARG I was employed to catalyze the conversion of L-Arg to L-Orn under optimal condition of 1 % glutaraldehyde, 1 mM Mn(2+), 40 degrees C, pH10 and an L-arginine (L-Arg) concentration of 200 g/L, achieving a highly converted content of 149.g/L L-Orn.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> In this work, ARG Iota was abundantly expressed, and an efficient, facile and repeatable method was developed to synthesize high-quality L-Orn. This method not only solved the problem of obtaining a large amount of arginase, but also provided a promising alternative for the future industrial production of L-Orn.</p><hr><h4>Functional diversity and properties of multiple xylanases from Penicillium oxalicum GZ-2.</h4><p>H. Liao et al., Sci Rep 5 12631 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26224514>pubmed link</a></p><p>A multiple xylanase system with high levels of xylanase activity produced from Penicillium oxalicum GZ-2 using agricultural waste as a substrate has been previously reported. However, the eco-physiological properties and origin of the multiplicity of xylanases remain unclear. In the present study, eight active bands were detected using zymography, and all bands were identified as putative xylanases using MALDI-TOF-MS/MS. These putative xylanases are encoded by six different xylanase genes. To evaluate the functions and eco-physiological properties of xylanase genes, xyn10A, xyn11A, xyn10B and xyn11B were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzymes xyn10A and xyn10B belong to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 xylanases, while xyn11A and xyn11B belong to GH11 xylanases. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that all enzymes exhibited xylanase activity against xylans but with different substrate specificities, properties and kinetic parameters. These results demonstrated that the production of multiple xylanases in P. oxalicum GZ-2 was attributed to the genetic redundancy of xylanases and the post-translational modifications, providing insight into a more diverse xylanase system for the efficient degradation of complex hemicelluloses.</p><hr><h4>A newly isolated yeast as an expression host for recombinant lipase.</h4><p>S. N. Oslan et al., Cell Mol Biol Lett 20 279 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26204408>pubmed link</a></p><p>Pichia guilliermondii strain SO isolated from spoiled orange was developed for use as an alternative expression host by using Pichia pastoris as the model of the experiment. This is the first study to report on the capability of P. guilliermondii SO as a host to express thermostable T1 lipase from Geobacillus zalihae. Alcohol oxidase and formaldehyde dehydrogenase promoters were present in the yeast genome. Interestingly, the recombinant yeast [SO/pPICZalphaB/T1-2 (SO2)] took only 30 h to reach optimal production with minimal methanol induction [1.5% (v/v)] in YPTM medium, as compared to P. pastoris, which took longer to reach its optimal condition. The purification yield of the His-tagged fusion lipase was 68.58%, with specific activity of 194.58 U/mg. The optimum temperature was 65 degrees C at pH 9 in glycine-NaOH buffer, and it was stable up to 70 degrees C in a wide pH range from pH 5 to 12. In conclusion, a newly isolated yeast from spoiled orange has been proven suitable for use as an expression host.</p><hr><h4>High-level secretion of human bikunin from recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Yao, J. Zhang, X. Wang, Lett Appl Microbiol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26202000>pubmed link</a></p><p>Human bikunin is a glycoprotein that exhibits trypsin inhibitory activity against serine proteases, and is effective in clinic. However, limited productivity and high price of human bikunin retard its further application. In this study, a high-yield, low-cost process of recombinant human bikunin (rh-bikunin) production from Pichia pastoris was established. The trypsin inhibitory activity reached 6.2x103 IU mL-1 after 120 h induction of Pichia pastoris fermentation process, which was 20-fold higher than that of previous yield. Further, a simple and low-cost purification process, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion exchange adsorption of impurity and cation exchange chromatography, was developed with the results of 38.7% recovery and 96.6% purity of rh-bikunin. This work made a big step to improve bikunin further application in clinic. This article is protected by copyright.

Baosheng et al., J Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26198121>pubmed link</a></p><p>In order to improve the stabilities of endoglucanase under thermal and acidic conditions, the endoglucanase gene (eg) was fused to the N-terminus of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pir gene encoding the cell wall protein PIR. The fusion gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 for expression. A resulting strain with high expression and high activity was identified by examining resistance to Geneticin 418, Congo red staining and quantitative analysis of enzyme activity. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the endoglucanase (EG) was successfully displayed on the yeast cell surface. The displayed endoglucanase (DEG) showed a maximum activity towards sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMCNa) at approximately 275 IU/g cell dry weight. DEG exhibited greater than 60% residual activity in the range pH 2.5-8.5, higher than free endoglucanase (FEG) which had 40% residual activity at the same pH range. The highest tolerated temperature for DEG was 70 degrees C, much higher than that of FEG which was approximately 50 degrees C. Moreover, DEG showed 91.1% activity at 65 masculineC for 120 min, while FEG only kept 77.8% residual activity over the same period. The half-life time of DEG was 270min at 65 degrees C, compared with only 150 min for FEG. DEG could be used repeatedly at least three times. These results suggested 40 that the DEG has broad applications as a yeast whole-cell biocatalyst due to its novel properties with high catalytic efficiency, acid-thermal stabilities and reusability.</p><hr><h4>Delta-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase production in Pichia pastoris enables chemical synthesis of cannabinoids.</h4><p>K. Lange, A. Schmid, M. K. Julsing, J Biotechnol 211 68 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26197418>pubmed link</a></p><p>Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is of increasing interest as a pharmaceutical and bioactive compound. Chemical synthesis of THC uses a laborious procedure and does not satisfy the market demand. The implementation of biocatalysts for specific synthesis steps might be beneficial for making natural product availability independent from the plant. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCAS) from C. sativa L. catalyzes the cyclization of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) to Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), which is non-enzymatically decarboxylated to THC. We report the preparation of THCAS in amounts sufficient for the biocatalytic production of THC(A). Active THCAS was most efficiently obtained from Pichia pastoris. THCAS was produced on a 2L bioreactor scale and the enzyme was isolated by single-step chromatography with a specific activity of 73Ug-1total protein. An organic/aqueous two-liquid phase setup for continuous substrate delivery facilitated in situ product removal. In addition, THCAS activity in aqueous environments lasted for only 20min whereas the presence of hexane stabilized the activity over 3h. In conclusion, production of THCAS in P. pastoris MutS KM71 KE1, subsequent isolation, and its application in a two-liquid phase setup enables the synthesis of THCA on a mg scale.</p><hr><h4>Expression, purification, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of a recombinant Tc24 antigen as a vaccine against Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice.</h4><p>V. Martinez-Campos et al., Vaccine   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192358>pubmed link</a></p><p>The Tc24 calcium binding protein from the flagellar pocket of Trypanosoma cruzi is under evaluation as a candidate vaccine antigen against Chagas disease. Previously, a DNA vaccine encoding Tc24 was shown to be an effective vaccine (both as a preventive and therapeutic intervention) in mice and dogs, as evidenced by reductions in T. cruzi parasitemia and cardiac amastigotes, as well as reduced cardiac inflammation and increased host survival. Here we developed a suitable platform for the large scale production of recombinant Tc24 (rTc24) and show that when rTc24 is combined with a monophosphoryl-lipid A (MPLA) adjuvant, the formulated vaccine induces a Th1-biased immune response in mice, comprised of elevated IgG2a antibody levels and interferon-gamma levels from splenocytes, compared to controls. These immune responses also resulted in statistically significant decreased T. cruzi parasitemia and cardiac amastigotes, as well as increased survival following T. cruzi challenge infections, compared to controls. Partial protective efficacy was shown regardless of whether the antigen was expressed in Escherichia coli or in yeast (Pichia pastoris). While mouse vaccinations will require further modifications in order to optimize protective efficacy, such studies provide a basis for further evaluations of vaccines comprised of rTc24, together with alternative adjuvants and additional recombinant antigens.</p><hr><h4>Improved Gene Targeting through Cell Cycle Synchronization.</h4><p>V.

Using hydroxyurea-mediated cell cycle arrest, we obtained improved gene targeting rates in Yarrowia lipolytica, Arxula adeninivorans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis and Pichia pastoris demonstrating the broad applicability of the method. Hydroxyurea treatment enriches for S-phase cells that are active in homologous recombination and enables previously unattainable genomic modifications.</p><hr><h4>Genome and secretome analyses provide insights into keratin decomposition by novel proteases from the non-pathogenic fungus Onygena corvina.</h4><p>Y. Huang, P. K. Busk, F. A. Herbst, L. Lange, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26177915>pubmed link</a></p><p>Poultry processing plants and slaughterhouses produce huge quantities of feathers and hair/bristle waste annually. These keratinaceous wastes are highly resistant to degradation. Onygena corvina, a non-pathogenic fungus, grows specifically on feathers, hooves, horn, and hair in nature. Hence, the proteases secreted by O. corvina are interesting in view of their potential relevance for industrial decomposition of keratinaceous wastes. We sequenced and assembled the genome of O. corvina and used a method called peptide pattern recognition to identify 73 different proteases. Comparative genome analysis of proteases in keratin-degrading and non-keratin-degrading fungi indicated that 18 putative secreted proteases from four protease families (M36, M35, M43, and S8) may be responsible for keratin decomposition. Twelve of the 18 predicted protease genes could be amplified from O. corvina grown on keratinaceous materials and were transformed into Pichia pastoris. One of the recombinant proteases belonging to the S8 family showed high keratin-degrading activity. Furthermore, 29 different proteases were identified by mass spectrometry in the culture broth of O. corvina grown on feathers and bristle. The culture broth was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography to isolate active fractions with five novel proteases belonging to three protease families (S8, M28, and M3). Enzyme blends composed of three of these five proteases, one from each family, showed high degree of degradation of keratin in vitro. A blend of novel proteases, such as those we discovered, could possibly find a use for degrading keratinaceous wastes and provide proteins, peptides, and amino acids as valuable ingredients for animal feed.</p><hr><h4>An Enzymatically Active beta-1,3-Glucanase from Ash Pollen with Allergenic Properties: A Particular Member in the Oleaceae Family.</h4><p>M. Torres et al., PLoS One 10 e0133066 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26177095>pubmed link</a></p><p>Endo-beta-1,3-glucanases are widespread enzymes with glycosyl hydrolitic activity involved in carbohydrate remodelling during the germination and pollen tube growth. Although members of this protein family with allergenic activity have been reported, their effective contribution to allergy is little known. In this work, we identified Fra e 9 as a novel allergenic beta-1,3-glucanase from ash pollen. We produced the catalytic and carbohydrate-binding domains as two independent recombinant proteins and characterized them from structural, biochemical and immunological point of view in comparison to their counterparts from olive pollen. We showed that despite having significant differences in biochemical activity Fra e 9 and Ole e 9 display similar IgE-binding capacity, suggesting that beta-1,3-glucanases represent an heterogeneous family that could display intrinsic allergenic capacity. Specific cDNA encoding Fra e 9 was cloned and sequenced. The full-length cDNA encoded a polypeptide chain of 461 amino acids containing a signal peptide of 29 residues, leading to a mature protein of 47760.2 Da and a pI of 8.66. An N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module are the components of this enzyme. Despite the phylogenetic proximity to the olive pollen beta-1,3-glucanase, Ole e 9, there is only a 39% identity between both sequences. The N- and C-terminal domains have been produced as independent recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively. Although a low or null enzymatic activity has been associated to long beta-1,3-glucanases, the recombinant N-terminal domain has 200-fold higher hydrolytic activity on laminarin than reported for Ole e 9. The C-terminal domain of Fra e 9, a cysteine-rich compact structure, is able to bind laminarin. Both molecules retain comparable IgE-binding capacity when assayed with allergic sera. In summary, the structural and functional comparison between these two closely phylogenetic related enzymes provides novel insights into the complexity of beta-1,3-glucanases, representing a heterogeneous protein family with intrinsic allergenic capacity.</p><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel manganese dependent endoglucanase belongs in GH family 5 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium.</h4><p>N. D. Huy et al., J Biosci Bioeng   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173955>pubmed link</a></p><p>The cDNA encoding a putative glycoside hydrolase family 5, which has been predicted to be an endoglucanase (PcEg5A), was cloned from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and expressed in Pichia pastoris. PcEg5A contains a carbohydrate-binding domain and two important amino acids, E209 and E319, playing as proton donor and nucleophile in substrate catalytic domain. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the recombinant endoglucanase 5A (rPcEg5A) has a molecular size of 43 kDa which corresponds with the theoretical calculation. Optimum pH and temperature were found to be 4.5-6.0, and 50 degrees C-60 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, rPcEg5A exhibited maximal activity in the pH range of 3.0-8.0, whereas over 50% of activity still remained at 20 degrees C and 80 degrees C. rPcEg5A was stable at 60 degrees C for 12 h incubation, indicating that rPcEg5A is a thermostable enzyme. Manganese ion enhanced the enzyme activity by 77%, indicating that rPcEg5A is a metal dependent enzyme. The addition of rPcEg5A to cellobiase (cellobiohydrolase and beta-glucosidase) resulted in a 53% increasing saccharification of NaOH-pretreated barley straw, whereas the glucose release was 47% higher than that cellobiase treatment alone. Our study suggested that rPcEg5A is an enzyme with great potential for biomass saccharification.</p><hr><h4>Codon Optimization Significantly Improves the Expression Level of alpha -Amylase Gene from Bacillus licheniformis in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J.

To improve expression efficiency of recombinant alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (B. licheniformis), the alpha-amylase gene from B. licheniformis was optimized according to the codon usage of Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) and expressed in P. pastoris. Totally, the codons encoding 305 amino acids were optimized in which a total of 328 nucleotides were changed and the G+C content was increased from 47.6 to 49.2%. The recombinants were cultured in 96-deep-well microplates and screened by a new plate assay method. Compared with the wild-type gene, the optimized gene is expressed at a significantly higher level in P. pastoris after methanol induction for 168 h in 5- and 50-L bioreactor with the maximum activity of 8100 and 11000 U/mL, which was 2.31- and 2.62-fold higher than that by wild-type gene. The improved expression level makes the enzyme a good candidate for alpha-amylase production in industrial use.</p><hr><h4>Restriction site free cloning (RSFC) plasmid family for seamless, sequence independent cloning in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>T. Vogl et al., Microb Cell Fact 14 103 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169367>pubmed link</a></p><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Tagging proteins is a standard method facilitating protein detection, purification or targeting. When tagging a certain protein of interest, it is challenging to predict which tag will give optimal results and will not interfere with protein folding, activity or yields. Ideally, multiple tags and positions are tested which however complicates molecular cloning and expression vector generation. In conventional cloning, tags are either added on PCR primers (requiring a distinct primer and PCR product per tag) or provided on the vector (typically leaving a restriction site scar).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Here we report a vector family of 40 plasmids allowing simple, seamless fusions of a single PCR product with various N- and C-terminal tags, signal sequences and promoters. The restriction site free cloning (RSFC) strategy presented in this paper relies on seamless cloning using type IIS restriction endonucleases. After cutting out a stuffer (placeholder) fragment from the vectors, a single PCR product can be directly inserted in frame into all 40 plasmids using blunt end or TA ligations, requiring only verification of the orientation. We have established a RSFC vector family for the commonly used protein expression host Pichia pastoris and demonstrated the system with the secretory expression of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). HRP fusions to four tags (Myc, FLAG, His, Strep) and two fusion proteins (GFP and MBP) showed a 31-fold difference in volumetric activities. C-terminal tagging caused in some cases almost a complete loss of function, whereas N-terminal tags showed moderate differences.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The RSFC vectors provide an unprecedented toolbox for expression optimization in P. pastoris. The results obtained with HRP underline the importance of comparing different tags to maximize activities of fusion proteins. In a similar fashion the RSFC strategy can be applied in other expression hosts to screen for optimal promoters, signal sequences or to facilitate the evaluation of (iso-) enzyme families.</p><hr><h4>Preparation and functional characterization of human vascular endothelial growth factor-melittin fusion protein with analysis of the antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.</h4><p>D. Wang et al., Int J Oncol 47 1160 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26166416>pubmed link</a></p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor and its tyrosine kinase receptors have been identified as key mediators of the regulation of pathologic blood vessel growth and maintenance in the promotion of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Therefore, an alternative approach to destroying tumor endothelium would be to make this tissue particularly sensitive to VEGF-mediated drug delivery. To verify this hypothesis, we generated a protein containing VEGF165 fused to melittin. Melittin is a small linear peptide composed of 26 amino acid residues that can exert toxic or inhibitory effects on many types of tumor cells. This protein is a cytolytic peptide that attacks lipid membranes, leading to significant toxicity. In the present study, the Pichia pastoris expression system was used to express the fusion protein. Under optimal conditions, stable VEGF165-melittin production was achieved using a series of purification steps. The activity of VEGF165-melittin fusion protein was compared with melittin for its ability to suppress the growth of tumor cell line in vitro. The fusion toxin selectively inhibited growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG-2 cell line with high expression of VEGFR-2. We found that sensitivity of VEGFR-2 transfected 293 cells to VEGF165-melittin enhanced as the cellular VEGFR-2 density increased. In an in vivo initial experiment, the fusion protein inhibited tumor growth in xenografts assays. Furthermore, successful expression and characterization of the fusion protein demonstrated its efficacy for use as a novel treatment strategy for cancer.</p><hr><h4>Cloning, expression and characterization of beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus niger ASKU28.</h4><p>K. Choengpanya et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26166179>pubmed link</a></p><p>beta-Xylosidases catalyze the breakdown of beta-1,4-xylooligosaccharides, which are produced from degradation of xylan by xylanases, to fermentable xylose. Due to their important role in xylan degradation, there is an interest in using these enzymes in biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, the coding sequence of a glycoside hydrolase family 3 beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus niger ASKU28 (AnBX) was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris as an N-terminal fusion protein with the alpha-mating factor signal sequence (alpha-MF) and a poly-histidine tag. The expression level was increased to 5.7g/l in a fermenter system as a result of optimization of only five codons near the 5' end of the alpha-MF sequence. The recombinant AnBX was purified to homogeneity through a single-step Phenyl Sepharose chromatography. The enzyme exhibited an optimal activity at 70 degrees C and at pH 4.0-4.5, and a very high kinetic efficiency toward a xyloside substrate. AnBX demonstrated an exo-type activity with retention of the beta-configuration, and a synergistic action with xylanase in hydrolysis of beechwood xylan. This study provides comprehensive data on characterization of a glycoside hydrolase family 3 beta-xylosidase that have not been determined in any prior investigations. Our results suggested that AnBX may be useful for degradation of lignocellulosic biomass in bioethanol production, pulp bleaching process and beverage industry.</p><hr><h4>Expression of a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, as a therapeutic agent for type II diabetes, with enhanced bioactivity and increased N-terminal homogeneity in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

GGH, consisting of two tandem mutant GLP-1 (GLP-1[A2G]) fused with the N-terminus of human serum albumin (HSA), was expressed in P. pastoris. We also designed and expressed the novel GLP-1 analogue NGGH, which had a His-tag fused with the N-terminus of GGH and an enterokinase (EK) cleavage site at the fusion junction. The His-tag was removed by EK digestion to yield GGH2, which was subsequently compared with GGH expressed in P. pastoris. The purification recovery of GGH2 was 35 % compared with 23 % for GGH. Furthermore, the bioactivity of GGH2 was 605 % higher than GGH, and N-terminal homogeneity was also improved.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A simple method for the preparation of GGH2 with a cleavable His-tag was developed, and the resultant protein possessed improved bioactivity and N-terminal homogeneity.</p><hr><h4>Development of a mixed feed strategy for a recombinant Pichia pastoris strain producing with a de-repression promoter.</h4><p>S.

However, the use of methanol brings several disadvantages, which is why current trends in bioprocess development with P. pastoris are focussing on minimizing the required amount of methanol or even avoid its employment. In this respect novel promoter systems which do not rely on methanol have been investigated and promoter variants were designed to fine-tune gene expression. Amongst these novel promoter systems, mutated AOX promoters, which are regulated by available carbon source concentration (so-called de-repressed promoters), are currently raising attention. However, the main disadvantage of such a production system is that expression and growth usually cannot happen concomitantly resulting in low space-time-yields.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Here we show the development of a mixed-feed strategy for an industrial recombinant P. pastoris de-repression strain aiming at increased productivity and maximum space-time-yield. By doing dynamic experiments we determined a ratio between the specific substrate uptake rates of glycerol and sorbitol allowing a more than 2-fold increased productivity compared to the conventional single substrate de-repression strategy.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Based on our results we recommend adjusting q(s glycerol) = 0.04 g g(-1) h(-1) and q(s sorbitol) = 0.055 g g(-1) h(-1) to obtain highest productivity with a P. pastoris de-repression strain. Our methodological approach of designing mixed-feed strategies based on physiological strain characterization using dynamic experiments proved to be beneficial.</p><hr><h4>Balancing the Expression and Production of a Heterodimeric Protein: Recombinant Agkisacutacin as a Novel Antithrombotic Drug Candidate.</h4><p>Y. Guo et al., Sci Rep 5 11730 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26144864>pubmed link</a></p><p>Agkisacucetin extracted from the venom of Agkistrodon acutus has been demonstrated to be a promising antithrombotic drug candidate in clinical studies due to its function as a novel platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib inhibitor. Agkisacucetin is a heterodimeric protein composed of alpha- and beta-subunits with seven disulphide bonds. Both subunits form inactive homodimeric products, which cause difficulties for recombinant production. In this study, Agkisacucetin alpha- and beta-subunits were inserted sequentially into the chromosome of Pichia pastoris at the mutant histidinol dehydrogenase gene and ribosomal DNA repeat sites, respectively. By optimizing the gene copies and productivity of each subunit by drug screening, we successfully obtained a recombinant strain with balanced expression of the two subunits. Using this strain, a yield greater than 100 mg/L recombinant Agkisacucetin in fed-batch fermentation was reached. The recombinant Agkisacucetin possessed extremely similar binding affinity to recombinant GPIb and human platelets in in vitro assays, and its ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation activity ex vivo was identical to that of the extracted native Agkisacucetin, demonstrating that the yeast-derived Agkisacucetin could be an effective alternative to native Agkisacucetin. Moreover, this study provides an effective strategy for balancing the expression and production of heterodimeric proteins in P. pastoris.</p><hr><h4>Expression, purification, crystallization and crystallographic study of Lutzomyia longipalpis LJL143.</h4><p>A.

Transmission of the parasite requires salivary proteins, including LJL143 from the New World sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis. LJL143 is a known marker of sandfly exposure in zoonotic hosts. LJL143 was crystallized from soluble protein expressed using Pichia pastoris. X-ray data were collected to 2.6 A resolution from orthorhombic crystals belonging to space group P212121, with average unit-cell parameters a = 57.39, b = 70.24, c = 79.58 A. The crystals are predicted to have a monomer in the asymmetric unit, with an estimated solvent content of 48.5%. LJL143 has negligible homology to any reported structures, so the phases could not be determined by molecular replacement. All attempts at S-SAD failed and future studies include experimental phase determination using heavy-atom derivatives.</p><hr><h4>Molecular cloning, expression of a galectin gene in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and the antibacterial activity of its recombinant protein.</h4><p>G.

In this study, a cDNA encoding a galectin in the Pacific white shrimp (L. vannamei) was identified and characterized. A recombinant variant of this lectin, rLvgalectin, was expressed in the model organism P. pastoris and its expression was confirmed by Western blot. Biochemical assays indicated that the recombinant protein antibacterial rLvgalectin activity and was expressed in all of the organism's tested tissues Injection of the bacterium V. alginolyticus into L. vannamei induced hemocytes upregulation of Lvgalectin. The recombinant Lvgalectin protein (rLvgalectin) could bind various microorganism including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. And it revealed antimicrobial activity against the test Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, but did not inhibit the growth of fungus Pichia pastoris. Moreover, rLvgalectin could significantly enhance the clearance activity of V. alginolyticus in vivo. In vivo challenge experiments showed that the recombinant rLvgalectin protein can significantly reduce the mortalities of V. alginolyticus injection. Furthermore, Compared to their wild-type counterparts, Lvgalectin-silenced shrimp exhibited increased mortality and hemocyte apoptosis, decreased bacterial clearance ability and total hemocyte counts, and stronger expression of Lvp53, LvproPO, LvPEN3, and LvCrustin following V. alginolyticus challenge. Taken together, these results suggest that galectin is important in the innate immune response of shrimp to pathogens infection.</p><hr><h4>Characterization of bioactive recombinant antimicrobial peptide parasin I fused with human lysozyme expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris system.</h4><p>H.

The objective of this study was to express and characterize a codon optimized parasin I peptide fused with human lysozyme (hLY). A 513bp cDNA fragment encoding the mature hLY protein and parasin I peptide was designed and synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris. A 4xGly flexible amino acid linker with an enterokinase cleavage (DDDDK) was designed to link the PI to the C-terminal of hLY. The codon optimized recombinant hLY-PI was cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector and expressed in P. pastoris. The over-expressed extracellular rehLY-PI was purified using Ni sepharose affinity column and exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 18kDa. After digested with enterokinase the rehLY-PI protein release its corresponding rehLY and rePI, with molecular mass of 16kDa and 2kDa, respectively, on Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The released rehLY exhibited similar lytical activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus to its commercial hLY. The digested rehLY-PI product exhibited antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and synergism has been found between the released rePI and rehLY. In conclusion, we successfully optimized a rehLY-PI fusion protein encoding gene and over-expressed the rehLY-PI in P. pastoris. The recombination protein digested with enterokinase released functional hLY and antimicrobial parasin I, which demonstrates a potential for future use as an animal feed additive to partly replace antibiotic.</p><hr><h4>Expression and Characterization of the RKOD DNA Polymerase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>F.

Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 is a DNA polymerase that is widely used in PCR. The DNA coding sequence of KOD was optimized based on the codon usage bias of P. pastoris and synthesized by overlapping PCR, and the nonspecific DNA-binding protein Sso7d from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus was fused to the C-terminus of KOD. The resulting novel gene was cloned into a pHBM905A vector and introduced into P. pastoris GS115 for secretory expression. The yield of the target protein reached approximately 250 mg/l after a 6-d induction with 1% (v/v) methanol in shake flasks. This yield is much higher than those of other DNA polymerases expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified, and its enzymatic features were studied. Its specific activity was 19,384 U/mg. The recombinant KOD expressed in P. pastoris exhibited excellent thermostability, extension rate and fidelity. Thus, this report provides a simple, efficient and economic approach to realize the production of a high-performance thermostable DNA polymerase on a large scale.

Xu et al., Plant Cell Rep   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26123289>pubmed link</a></p><p></p><p><strong>KEY MESSAGE:</strong> Vacuolar invertases (VINs) from Cu-tolerant and non-tolerant populations of Elsholtzia haichowensis have similar enzyme properties, and the enzyme protein divergences contribute little to the varied VIN activities between the contrasting populations. In our previous studies of Elsholtzia haichowensis, vacuolar invertase (VIN) activity in roots of a Cu-tolerant population was found to be significantly higher than that of a non-tolerant population under Cu stress. Divergences of amino acid residues in a sucrose-binding box and other regions of the VINs were detected. To test whether the amino acid divergences influence the enzyme properties of VINs, and thus are relevant to the differences in enzyme activities between the contrasting populations of E. haichowensis, two VIN genes from the Cu-tolerant population (EhCvINV) and non-tolerant population (EhNvINV) were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the enzyme properties of the recombinants were characterized and compared. Both of the recombinant enzymes showed temperature optima of 70 degrees C and pH optima of 4.5-5.5. Copper as well as other heavy metals caused almost the same inhibition to EhNvINV and EhCvINV. No statistically significant differences were observed between EhNvINV and EhCvINV in K m and k cat values for sucrose. The results provided evidence that the observed residue divergences had little influence on the enzyme properties of VIN in E. haichowensis, and the varied VIN activities between the contrasting populations under Cu stress were not relevant to the amino acid divergences in the proteins. Also, some other possible reasons accounting for this difference in invertase activities were discussed, such as up-regulation of expression of the EhCvINV gene under Cu stress, as Cu tolerance mechanisms in Cu-mine plants.</p><hr><h4>Metabolic engineering of microbes for branched-chain biodiesel production with low-temperature property.</h4><p>H.

Furthermore, by modifying the fatty acid pathway, we improved FABCE production to 273 mg/L and achieved a high proportion of FABCEs at 99.3 % of total fatty acid esters. In order to investigate the universality of this strategy, Pichia pastoris yeast was engineered and produced desirable levels of FABCEs for the first time with a good starting point of 169 mg/L.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We propose new pathways of fatty acid ester biosynthesis and establish proof of concept through metabolic engineering of E. coli and P. pastoris yeast.

The DNA fragment of porcine trypsin with its propeptide coding sequence was optimized and synthesized according to codon usage bias of Pichia pastoris. The optimized sequence was integrated into genome of P.pastoris GS115 by using the vector pHBM905A. The yield of the recombinant protein was 0.48 mg/ml with a maximum activity of 19.2 U/ml after 96h induction in a 5L fermenter. An optimum activity for the recombinant trypsin was observed at 35 degrees C and pH 8.5. This is the first time to express the porcine trypsinogen with P.pastoris expression system. This report also found that the propeptide was cleaved from the recombinant protein and the enzymogen was transferred into trypsin at the later phase of the fed-batch cultivation. In particular, the activation process can be initiated by changing pH.</p><hr><h4>Comparison of the single molecule activity distributions of recombinant and non-recombinant bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase.</h4><p>D.

Degani et al., Protein Expr Purif 114 48 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26118699>pubmed link</a></p><p>The receptor for the advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and binds a variety of unrelated ligands sharing a negative charge. Most ligands bind to the extracellular V or VC1 domains of the receptor. In this work, V and VC1 of human RAGE were produced in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and directed to the secretory pathway. Fusions to a removable C-terminal His-tag evidenced proteolytic processing of the tag by extracellular proteases and also intracellular degradation of the N-terminal portion of V-His. Expression of untagged forms was attempted. While the V domain was retained intracellularly, VC1 was secreted into the medium and was functionally active in binding AGEs. The glycosylation state of VC1 was analyzed by mass spectrometry and peptide-N-glycosidase F digestion. Like RAGE isolated from mammalian sources, the degree of occupancy of the N-glycosylation sites was full at Asn25 and partial at Asn81 which was also subjected to non-enzymatic deamidation. A simple procedure for the purification to homogeneity of VC1 from the medium was developed. The folded state of the purified protein was assessed by thermal shift assays. Recombinant VC1 from P. pastoris showed a remarkably high thermal stability as compared to the protein expressed in bacteria. Our in vivo approach indicates that the V and C1 domains constitute a single folding unit. The stability and solubility of the yeast-secreted VC1 may be beneficial for future in vitro studies aimed to identify new ligands or inhibitors of RAGE.</p><hr><h4>The neutral metallopeptidase NMP1 of Trichoderma guizhouense is required for mycotrophy and self-defence.</h4><p>J.

To identify genes involved in this trait, we used T-DNA insertional mutagenesis and isolated one mutant that was unable to overgrow Foc4 and had reduced antifungal ability. Using the high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR, the T-DNA was located in the terminator of a neutral metalloprotease gene (encoding a MEROPS family M35 protease), which was named nmp1. The antifungal activity of the mutant was recovered by retransformation with wild-type nmp1 gene. The purified NMP1 (overexpressed in Pichia pastoris) did not inhibit the growth and germination of other fungi in vitro. Its addition, however, partly recovered the antifungal activity of the mutant strain against some fungi. The expression of nmp1 is induced by the presence of fungi and by dead fungal biomass, but the time-course of transcript accumulation following the physical contact depends on mode of interaction: it increases in cases of long-lasting parasitism and decreases if the prey fungus is dead shortly after or even before the contact (predation). We thus conclude that NMP1 protein of T. guizhouense has major importance for mycotrophic interactions and defence against other fungi.</p><hr><h4>Evaluation of recombinant MGL_1304 produced by Pichia pastoris for clinical application to sweat allergy.</h4><p>T.

However, purifying native MGL_1304 from human sweat or culture supernatant of M. globosa (sup-MGL_1304) is costly and time-consuming. Moreover, recombinant MGL_1304 expressed by using Escherichia coli (TF-rMGL_1304) needs a large chaperon protein and lacks the original glycosylation of yeasts. Thus, we generated a recombinant MGL_1304 by Pichia pastoris (P-rMGL_1304) and investigated its characteristic features.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> Recombinant MGL_1304 proteins expressed by E. coli and P. pastoris were generated. Properties of these recombinants and native antigens were compared by western blot analysis, histamine release tests (HRT) of patients with AD and ChU, and beta-hexosaminidase release tests with RBL-48 cells. P-rMGL_1304-specific IgE in sera of patients with AD were measured by sandwich ELISA.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Western blot analysis revealed that IgE of patients with AD bound to all MGL_1304 recombinants and native antigens. The histamine releasing ability of P-rMGL_1304 was 100 times higher than that of TF-rMGL_1304, and was comparable to that of sup-MGL_1304. Degranulation rates of RBL-48 cells, sensitized with sera of patients with AD in response to the stimulation of P-rMGL_1304, were comparable to those of sup-MGL_1304, whereas those of TF-rMGL_1304 were relatively weak. The levels of P-rMGL_1304-specific IgE in sera of patients with AD were correlated with their disease severities.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> P-rMGL_1304 has an antigenicity comparable to the native antigen, and is more useful than TF-rMGL_1304, especially in HRT and degranulation assay of RBL-48 cells.</p><hr><h4>Manganese lipoxygenase of F. oxysporum and the structural basis for biosynthesis of distinct 11-hydroperoxy stereoisomers.</h4><p>A.

The genome of F. oxysporum codes for linoleate 13S-LOX (FoxLOX) and for F. oxysporum manganese LOX (Fo-MnLOX), an uncharacterized homolog of 13R-MnLOX of Gaeumannomyces graminis. We expressed Fo-MnLOX and compared its properties to Cg-MnLOX from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Electron paramagnetic resonance and metal analysis showed that Fo-MnLOX contained catalytic Mn. Fo-MnLOX oxidized 18:2n-6 mainly to 11R-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), 13S-HPODE, and 9(S/R)-HPODE, whereas Cg-MnLOX produced 9S-, 11S-, and 13R-HPODE with high stereoselectivity. The 11-hydroperoxides did not undergo the rapid beta-fragmentation earlier observed with 13R-MnLOX. Oxidation of [11S-(2)H]18:2n-6 by Cg-MnLOX was accompanied by loss of deuterium and a large kinetic isotope effect (>30). The Fo-MnLOX-catalyzed oxidation occurred with retention of the (2)H-label. Fo-MnLOX also oxidized 1-lineoyl-2-hydroxy-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine. The predicted active site of all MnLOXs contains Phe except for Ser(348) in this position of Fo-MnLOX. The Ser348Phe mutant of Fo-MnLOX oxidized 18:2n-6 to the same major products as Cg-MnLOX. Our results suggest that Fo-MnLOX, with support of Ser(348), binds 18:2n-6 so that the proR rather than the proS hydrogen at C-11 interacts with the metal center, but retains the suprafacial oxygenation mechanism observed in other MnLOXs.</p><hr><h4>A purple acid phosphatase plays a role in nodule formation and nitrogen fixation in Astragalus sinicus.</h4><p>J.

To address the functions of AsPPD1 in legume-rhizobium symbiosis, its expression patterns, enzyme activity, subcellular localization, and phenotypes associated with its over-expression and RNA interference (RNAi) were investigated. The expression of AsPPD1 was up-regulated in roots and nodules after inoculation with rhizobia. Phosphate starvation reduced the levels of AsPPD1 transcripts in roots while increased those levels in nodules. We confirmed the acid phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities of recombinant AsPPD1 purified from Pichia pastoris, and demonstrated its ability to hydrolyze ADP and ATP in vitro. Subcellular localization showed that AsPPD1 located on the plasma membranes in hairy roots and on the symbiosomes membranes in root nodules. Over-expression of AsPPD1 in hairy roots inhibited nodulation, while its silencing resulted in nodules early senescence and significantly decreased nitrogenase activity. Furthermore, HPLC measurement showed that AsPPD1 overexpression affects the ADP levels in the infected roots and nodules, AsPPD1 silencing affects the ratio of ATP/ADP and the energy charge in nodules, and quantitative observation demonstrated the changes of AsPPD1 transcripts level affected nodule primordia formation. Taken together, it is speculated that AsPPD1 contributes to symbiotic ADP levels and energy charge control, and this is required for effective nodule organogenesis and nitrogen fixation.</p><hr><h4>Phosphorylation of Pex11p does not regulate peroxisomal fission in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha.</h4><p>A.

In S. cerevisiae but not in P. pastoris, Pex11p phosphorylation was shown to regulate the protein's trafficking to peroxisomes. However, phosphorylation of PpPex11p was proposed to influence its interaction with Fis1p, another component of the organellar fission machinery. Here, we have examined the role of Pex11p phosphorylation in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Employing mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that HpPex11p is also phosphorylated on a Serine residue present at a similar position to that of ScPex11p and PpPex11p. Furthermore, through the use of mutants designed to mimic both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of HpPex11p, we have investigated the role of this post-translational modification. Our data demonstrate that mutations to the phosphorylation site do not disturb the function of Pex11p in peroxisomal fission, nor do they alter the localization of Pex11p. Also, no effect on peroxisome inheritance was observed. Taken together, these data lead us to conclude that peroxisomal fission in H. polymorpha is not modulated by phosphorylation of Pex11p.</p><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of LacMP, a novel fungal laccase of Moniliophthora perniciosa FA553.</h4><p>H.

The optimal pH for oxidation reactions with 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), syringaldazine, guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, were 6, 7.5, 6.5, and 6.5, respectively. The laccase activity was optimal at 60, 45, 45, and 55 degrees C for the four respective substrates. LacMP was stable at pH 6-8 and <30 degrees C. Li+, K+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ at 1 mM had no obvious effect on its activity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Given that LacMP has optimal activity under neutral and alkaline oxidation reaction conditions, it could be a potential candidate for industrial biocatalytic applications.</p><hr><h4>Microbial biofilms for the removal of Cu(2+) from CMP wastewater.</h4><p>A. P. Mosier, J. Behnke, E. T. Jin, N. C. Cady, J Environ Manage 160 67 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26093466>pubmed link</a></p><p>The modern semiconductor industry relies heavily on a process known as chemical mechanical planarization, which uses physical and chemical processes to remove excess material from the surface of silicon wafers during microchip fabrication. This process results in large volumes of wastewater containing dissolved metals including copper (Cu(2+)), which must then be filtered and treated before release into municipal waste systems. We have investigated the potential use of bacterial and fungal biomass as an alternative to the currently used ion-exchange resins for the adsorption of dissolved Cu(2+) from high-throughput industrial waste streams. A library of candidate microorganisms, including Lactobacillus casei and Pichia pastoris, was screened for ability to bind Cu(2+) from solution and to form static biofilm communities within packed-bed adsorption columns. The binding efficiency of these biomass-based adsorption columns was assessed under various flow conditions and compared to that of industrially used ion-exchange resins. We demonstrated the potential to regenerate the biomass within the adsorption columns through the use of a hydrochloric acid wash, and subsequently reuse the columns for additional copper binding. While the binding efficiency and capacity of the developed L. casei/P. pastoris biomass filters was inferior to ion-exchange resin, the potential for repeated reuse of these filters, coupled with the advantages of a more sustainable "green" adsorption process, make this technique an attractive candidate for use in industrial-scale CMP wastewater treatment.</p><hr><h4>FPLC and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry identify candidate necrosis-inducing proteins from culture filtrates of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici.</h4><p>S. Ben M'Barek et al., Fungal Genet Biol 79 54 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26092790>pubmed link</a></p><p>Culture filtrates (CFs) of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici were assayed for necrosis-inducing activity after infiltration in leaves of various wheat cultivars. Active fractions were partially purified and characterized. The necrosis-inducing factors in CFs are proteinaceous, heat stable and their necrosis-inducing activity is temperature and light dependent. The in planta activity of CFs was tested by a time series of proteinase K (PK) co-infiltrations, which was unable to affect activity 30min after CF infiltrations. This suggests that the necrosis inducing proteins (NIPs) are either absent from the apoplast and likely actively transported into mesophyll cells or protected from the protease by association with a receptor. Alternatively, plant cell death signaling pathways might be fully engaged during the first 30min and cannot be reversed even after PK treatment. Further fractionation of the CFs with the highest necrosis-inducing activity involved fast performance liquid chromatography, SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. This revealed that most of the proteins present in the fractions have not been described before. The two most prominent ZtNIP encoding candidates were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and subsequent infiltration assays showed their differential activity in a range of wheat cultivars.</p><hr><h4>Metabolomics sampling of Pichia pastoris revisited: rapid filtration prevents metabolite loss during quenching.</h4><p>H. Russmayer et al., FEMS Yeast Res 15  (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091839>pubmed link</a></p><p>Metabolomics can be defined as the quantitative assessment of a large number of metabolites of a biological system. A prerequisite for the accurate determination of intracellular metabolite concentrations is a reliable and reproducible sample preparation method, which needs to be optimized for each organism individually. Here, we compare the performance of rapid filtration and centrifugation after quenching of Pichia pastoris cells in cold methanol. During incubation in the quenching solution, metabolites are lost from the cells with a half-life of 70-180 min. Metabolites with lower molecular weights showed lower half-lifes compared to metabolites with higher molecular weight. Rapid filtration within 2 min after quenching leads to only minor losses below 2%, and is thus the preferred method for cell separation.</p><hr><h4>Soapwort Saporin L3 Expression in Yeast, Mutagenesis, and RNA Substrate Specificity.</h4><p>H.

Schramm, Biochemistry 54 4565 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091305>pubmed link</a></p><p>Saporin L3 from Saponaria officinalis (soapwort) leaves is a type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of oligonucleotide adenylate N-ribosidic bonds to release adenine from rRNA. Depurination sites include both adenines in the GAGA tetraloop of short sarcin-ricin stem-loops and multiple adenines within eukaryotic rRNA, tRNAs, and mRNAs. Multiple Escherichia coli vector designs for saporin L3 expression were attempted but demonstrated high toxicity even during plasmid maintenance and selection in E. coli nonexpression strains. Saporin L3 is >10(3) times more efficient at RNA deadenylation on short GAGA stem-loops than saporin S6, the saporin isoform currently used in immunotoxin clinical trials. We engineered a construct for the His-tagged saporin L3 to test for expression in Pichia pastoris when it is linked to the protein export system for the yeast alpha-mating factor. DNA encoding saporin L3 was cloned into a pPICZalphaB expression vector and expressed in P. pastoris under the alcohol dehydrogenase AOX1 promoter. A fusion protein of saporin L3 containing the pre-pro-sequence of the alpha-mating factor, the c-myc epitope, and the His tag was excreted from the P. pastoris cells and isolated from the culture medium. Autoprocessing of the alpha-mating factor yielded truncated saporin L3 (amino acids 22-280), the c-myc epitope, and the His tag expressed optimally as a 32 kDa construct following methanol induction. Saporin L3 was also expressed with specific alanines and/or serines mutated to cysteine. Native and Cys mutant saporins are kinetically similar. The recombinant expression of saporin L3 and its mutants permits the production and investigation of this high-activity ribosome-inactivating protein.</p><hr><h4>Optimized Proteomic Mass Spectrometry Characterization of Recombinant Human mu-Opioid Receptor Functionally Expressed in Pichia pastoris Cell Lines.</h4><p>M. Rosa et al., J Proteome Res 14 3162 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26090583>pubmed link</a></p><p>Human mu-opioid receptor (hMOR) is a class-A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), a prime therapeutic target for the management of moderate and severe pain. A chimeric form of the receptor has been cocrystallized with an opioid antagonist and resolved by X-ray diffraction; however, further direct structural analysis is still required to identify the active form of the receptor to facilitate the rational design of hMOR-selective agonist and antagonists with therapeutic potential. Toward this goal and in spite of the intrinsic difficulties posed by the highly hydrophobic transmembrane motives of hMOR, we have comprehensively characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis the primary sequence of the functional hMOR. Recombinant hMOR was overexpressed as a C-terminal c-myc and 6-his tagged protein using an optimized expression procedure in Pichia pastoris cells. After membrane solubilization and metal-affinity chromatography purification, a procedure was devised to enhance the concentration of the receptor. Subsequent combinations of in-solution and in-gel digestions using either trypsin, chymotrypsin, or proteinase K, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS or nanoliquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS analyses afforded an overall sequence coverage of up to >80%, a level of description first attained for an opioid receptor and one of the six such high-coverage MS-based analyses of any GPCR.</p><hr><h4>Development of an IP-Free Biotechnology Platform for Constitutive Production of HPV16 L1 Capsid Protein Using the Pichia pastoris PGK1 Promoter.</h4><p>F.

We report the development of a biotechnology platform for HPV16 L1 protein expression based on the constitutive PGK1 promoter (PPGK1) from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The L1 gene was cloned under regulation of PPGK1 into pPGKDelta3 expression vector to achieve intracellular expression. In parallel, secretion of the L1 protein was obtained through the use of an alternative vector called pPGKDelta3alpha, in which a codon optimized alpha-factor signal sequence was inserted. We devised a work-flow based on the detection of the L1 protein by dot blot, colony blot, and western blot to classify the positive clones. Finally, intracellular HPV VLPs assembly was demonstrated for the first time in yeast cells. This study opens up perspectives for the establishment of an innovative platform for the production of HPV VLPs or other viral antigens for vaccination purposes, based on constitutive expression in P. pastoris.</p><hr><h4>Expression and Characterization of Geobacillus stearothermophilus SR74 Recombinant alpha-Amylase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

Increased production and commercialization of thermostable alpha-amylase strongly warrant the need of a suitable expression system. In this study, the gene encoding the thermostable alpha-amylase in G. stearothermophilus SR74 was amplified, sequenced, and subcloned into P. pastoris GS115 strain under the control of a methanol inducible promoter, alcohol oxidase (AOX). Methanol induced recombinant expression and secretion of the protein resulted in high levels of extracellular amylase production. YPTM medium supplemented with methanol (1% v/v) was the best medium and once optimized, the maximum recombinant alpha-amylase SR74 achieved in shake flask was 28.6 U mL(-1) at 120 h after induction. The recombinant 59 kDa alpha-amylase SR74 was purified 1.9-fold using affinity chromatography with a product yield of 52.6% and a specific activity of 151.8 U mg(-1). The optimum pH of alpha-amylase SR74 was 7.0 and the enzyme was stable between pH 6.0-8.0. The purified enzyme was thermostable and thermoactive, exhibiting maximum activity at 65 degrees C with a half-life (t(1)/(2)) of 88 min at 60 degrees C. In conclusion, thermostable alpha-amylase SR74 from G. stearothermophilus SR74 would be beneficial for industrial applications, especially in liquefying saccrification.</p><hr><h4>Improving the catalytic performance of a GH11 xylanase by rational protein engineering.</h4><p>Y.

Cheng et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26088174>pubmed link</a></p><p>XynCDBFV from Neocallimastix patriciarum is among the most effective xylanases and holds great potentials in a wide variety of industrial applications. In the present study, several active site residues were modified referring to the instrumental information of the complex structure of XynCDBFV and xylooligosaccharides. Among the 12 single active site mutants, W125F and F163W show increased activity comparing to the wild-type protein. The double mutant W125F/F163W was then generated which displayed nearly 20 % increase in the enzyme activity. Although W125F/F163W showed 5 degrees C reduction in the optimal temperature, it still preserves similar thermostability and is more active than the wild-type enzyme at temperatures lower than 60 degrees C. These properties make the double mutant a suitable candidate for commercial applications that involve lower operating temperatures. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of N-glycosylation on the thermostability of XynCDBFV when expressed in the yeast strain Pichia pastoris for industrial use. Two potential glycosylation sites (Asn-37 and Asn-88) were examined, and their roles in enzyme performance were validated. We found that the N-glycosylations of XynCDBFV are related to both catalytic activity and heat stability, with Asn-37 motif playing a dominant role. Collectively, the enzymatic properties of XynCDBFV were improved by molecular engineering, and the influences of N-glycosylations on the enzyme have been clearly elucidated herein.</p><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris X-33 has probiotic properties with remarkable antibacterial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium.</h4><p>R.

The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is widely used as heterologous protein production platform. However, its use as probiotic is poorly studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate some probiotic properties of the P. pastoris strain X-33 wild type. The resistance to in vitro and in vivo gastrointestinal conditions, stability in feed, safety, and antibacterial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium were evaluated. The yeast remained viable and persisted at appropriate concentration in the diet for at least 2 months, survived the stresses of the gastrointestinal tract in vitro and in vivo, caused no behavioral changes or lesions when administered to mice, inhibited the growth of S. Typhimurium in culture media, and reduced adhesion of the bacteria to the intestinal cells HCT-116. In the challenge experiment with a LD50 of virulent S. Typhimurium strain, mice supplemented with the yeast had a higher survival rate (50 % when administered by gavage and 80 % via the diet, compared with 20 and 50 %, respectively, in the control group). In addition, the S. Typhimurium concentration in the intestine of the surviving mice was lower; the score of intestinal lesions, lower; and the pathogen, not detected in the liver, spleen, and feces when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). It was concluded that the yeast Pichia pastoris X-33 has probiotic properties with remarkable antibacterial activity against S.

In this study, a novel alpha-galactosidase gene of glycoside hydrolase family 27 (aga27A) was cloned from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Purified recombinant Aga27A (rAga27A) was thermophilic and thermotolerant, exhibiting the maximum activity at 70 degrees C and retaining stability at 65 degrees C. Like most fungal alpha-galactosidases, rAga27A had an acidic pH optimum (pH 4.0) but retained stability over a boarder pH range (pH 3.0-11.0) at 70 degrees C. Moreover, the enzyme exhibited strong resistance to most metal ions and chemicals tested (except for Ag+ and SDS) and great tolerance to galactose (19 mM). The preferable transglycosylation capacity of rAga27A with various substrates further widens its application spectrum. Thus rAga27A with excellent enzymatic properties will be ideal for applications in various industries, especially for the synthesis of galactooligosaccharides.</p><hr><h4>Development of a multiplex fluorescence immunological assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against Cooperia oncophora, Dictyocaulus viviparus and Fasciola hepatica in cattle.</h4><p>S.

Antigens were covalently coupled onto magnetic beads. Optimal concentrations for coupling were determined following the examination of serum samples collected from experimentally mono-infected animals, before and after their infection with the target species. Absence of cross-reactivity was further determined with sera from calves mono-infected with Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia ostertagi and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Examination of negative serum samples was characterised by low median fluorescence intensity (MFI).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Establishment of the optimal serum dilution of 1:200 was achieved for all three bead sets. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses were performed to obtain cut-off MFI values for each parasite separately. Sensitivity and specificity at the chosen cut-off values were close to, or 100% for all bead sets. Examination of serum samples collected on different days post infection from different animals showed a high reproducibility of the assays. Serum samples were additionally examined with two already established ELISAs, an in-house ELISA using the recombinant MSP as an antigen and a DRG ELISA using Cathepsin L1 for liver fluke. The results between the assays were compared and kappa tests revealed an overall good agreement.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A versatile bead-based assay using fluorescence detection (xMAP technology) was developed to simultaneously detect antibodies against C. oncophora, D. viviparus and F. hepatica in cattle serum samples. This platform provides rapid, high-throughput results and is highly sensitive and specific in comparison to existing serological as well as coproscopical diagnostic techniques.</p><hr><h4>Use of ELISA based on NcSRS2 of Neospora caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris for diagnosing neosporosis in sheep and dogs.</h4><p>A.

Due to the rigid structure of their cell walls, a number of proteins have been successfully displayed on their cell surfaces. It was previously reported that the viral binding protein Rab7 from the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (PmRab7) and its binding partner envelope protein VP28 of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) could independently protect shrimp against WSSV infection. Thus, we aimed to display these two proteins independently on the cell surfaces of 2 yeast clones with the ultimate goal of using a mixture of the two clones as an orally deliverable, antiviral agent to protect shrimp against WSSV infection. PmRab7 and VP28 were modified by N-terminal tagging to the C-terminal half of S. cerevisiae alpha-agglutinin. DNA fragments, harboring fused-gene expression cassettes under control of an alcohol oxidase I (AOX1) promoter were constructed and used to transform the yeast cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies specific to both proteins demonstrated that mutated PmRab7 (mPmRab7) and partial VP28 (pVP28) were localized on the cell surfaces of the respective clones, and fluorescence intensity for each was significantly higher than that of control cells by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using cells displaying mPmRab7 or pVP28 revealed that the binding of specific antibodies for each was dose-dependent, and could be saturated. In addition, the binding of mPmRab7-expressing cells with free VP28, and vice versa was dose dependent. Binding between the two surface-expressed proteins was confirmed by an assay showing agglutination between cells expressing complementary mPmRab7 and pVP28. In summary, our genetically engineered P. pastoris can display biologically active mPmRab7 and pVP28 and is now ready for evaluation of efficacy in protecting shrimp against WSSV by oral administration.</p><hr><h4>Crystal structure of the effector AvrLm4-7 of Leptosphaeria maculans reveals insights into its translocation into plant cells and recognition by resistance proteins.</h4><p>K. Blondeau et al., Plant J 83 610 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082394>pubmed link</a></p><p>The avirulence gene AvrLm4-7 of Leptosphaeria maculans, the causal agent of stem canker in Brassica napus (oilseed rape), confers a dual specificity of recognition by two resistance genes (Rlm4 and Rlm7) and is strongly involved in fungal fitness. In order to elucidate the biological function of AvrLm4-7 and understand the specificity of recognition by Rlm4 and Rlm7, the AvrLm4-7 protein was produced in Pichia pastoris and its crystal structure was determined. It revealed the presence of four disulfide bridges, but no close structural analogs could be identified. A short stretch of amino acids in the C terminus of the protein, (R/N)(Y/F)(R/S)E(F/W), was well-conserved among AvrLm4-7 homologs. Loss of recognition of AvrLm4-7 by Rlm4 is caused by the mutation of a single glycine to an arginine residue located in a loop of the protein. Loss of recognition by Rlm7 is governed by more complex mutational patterns, including gene loss or drastic modifications of the protein structure. Three point mutations altered residues in the well-conserved C-terminal motif or close to the glycine involved in Rlm4-mediated recognition, resulting in the loss of Rlm7-mediated recognition. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) and particle bombardment experiments on leaves from oilseed rape suggested that AvrLm4-7 interacts with its cognate R proteins inside the plant cell, and can be translocated into plant cells in the absence of the pathogen. Translocation of AvrLm4-7 into oilseed rape leaves is likely to require the (R/N)(Y/F)(R/S)E(F/W) motif as well as an RAWG motif located in a nearby loop that together form a positively charged region.</p><hr><h4>High yield expression and purification of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 7 (ENT7) from Arabidopsis thaliana.</h4><p>C.

CHH plays a principal role in the control of glucose metabolism. The CHH-B1 isoform is produced in the eyestalk of Litopenaeus vannamei by alternative splicing of the chhB gene and its cDNA sequence has revealed that this isoform has a non-amidated C-terminal residue (CHH-like peptide). In this work, a recombinant CHH-B1 (rCHH-B1) with a sequence identical to the native hormone was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris X-33 and purified from the culture medium by RP-HPLC. The identity of the purified rCHH-B1 was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and by using an anti-CHH-B1 polyclonal antibody. An in vivo assay showed that the hyperglycemic effect was dependant of the dosage of rCHH-B1, and the maximal hyperglycemic response was obtained with 250pmol treatment. These results suggest that the amino acid sequence of the C-terminus and its correct structure are both important for the hyperglycemic activity of naturally occurring non-amidated CHH peptides, such as CHH-B1. CHH-B1 appears to be the first reported CHH-like peptide with significant hyperglycemic activity produced in the sinus gland of a penaeid shrimp.</p><hr><h4>Molecular Structures and Ion Mobility Cross Sections: Analysis of the Effects of He and N2 Buffer Gas.</h4><p>C.

Experimental cross sections were determined for tetraglycine, bradykinin, angiotensin 2, melittin, and ubiquitin at 300 K and in the range from 80 to 550 K on home-built instruments and calculated by the projection superposition approximation (PSA) method. The PSA was also used to predict cross sections for larger systems such as human pancreatic alpha-amylase, concanavalin, Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase, and Klebsiella pneumoniae acetolactate synthase. The data show that the ratio of cross sections in helium and nitrogen depends significantly on the temperature of the buffer gas as well as the size and shape of the analyte ion. Therefore, the analysis of the data indicates that a simple formula that seeks to quantitatively relate the momentum transfer cross sections observed in two distinct buffer gases lacks a sound physical basis.</p><hr><h4>Cloning, Expression and Characterization of a Thermostable Esterase HydS14 from Actinomadura sp.

The HydS14 sequence shows 46%-64% identity to 23 sequences from actinomycetes (23 alpha/beta-hydrolases), has three conserved regions, and contains the novel motif (GY(F)SLG), which distinguishes it from other clusters in the alpha/beta-hydrolase structural superfamily. A plasmid containing the coding region (pPICZalphaA-hydS14) was used to express HydS14 in Pichia pastoris under the control of the AOXI promoter. The recombinant HydS14 collected from the supernatant had a molecular mass of ~30 kDa, which agrees with its predicted molecular mass without N-glycosylation. HydS14 had an optimum temperature of approximately 70 degrees C and an optimum pH of 8.0. HydS14 was stable at 50 and 60 degrees C for 120 min, with residual activities of above 80% and above 90%, respectively, as well as 50% activity at pH 6.0-8.0 and pH 9.0, respectively. The enzyme showed higher activity with p-nitrophenyl-C2 and C4. The Km and Vmax values for p-nitrophenyl-C4 were 0.21 +/- 0.02 mM and 37.07 +/- 1.04 mumol/min/mg, respectively. The enzyme was active toward short-chain p-nitrophenyl ester (C2-C6), displaying optimal activity with p-nitrophenyl-C4 (Kcat/Km = 11.74 mM(-1) . S(-1)). In summary, HydS14 is a thermostable esterase from Actinomadura sp. S14 that has been cloned and expressed for the first time in Pichia pastoris.</p><hr><h4>Human recombinant lysosomal enzymes produced in microorganisms.</h4><p>A. J. Espejo-Mojica et al., Mol Genet Metab   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26071627>pubmed link</a></p><p>Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by accumulation of partially degraded substrates within the lysosome, as a result of a function loss of a lysosomal protein. Recombinant lysosomal proteins are usually produced in mammalian cells, based on their capacity to carry out post-translational modifications similar to those observed in human native proteins. However, during the last years, a growing number of studies have shown the possibility to produce active forms of lysosomal proteins in other expression systems, such as plants and microorganisms. In this paper, we review the production and characterization of human lysosomal proteins, deficient in several LSDs, which have been produced in microorganisms. For this purpose, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Ogataea minuta have been used as expression systems. The recombinant lysosomal proteins expressed in these hosts have shown similar substrate specificities, and temperature and pH stability profiles to those produced in mammalian cells. In addition, pre-clinical results have shown that recombinant lysosomal enzymes produced in microorganisms can be taken-up by cells and reduce the substrate accumulated within the lysosome. Recently, metabolic engineering in yeasts has allowed the production of lysosomal enzymes with tailored N-glycosylations, while progresses in E. coli N-glycosylations offer a potential platform to improve the production of these recombinant lysosomal enzymes. In summary, microorganisms represent convenient platform for the production of recombinant lysosomal proteins for biochemical and physicochemical characterization, as well as for the development of ERT for LSD.</p><hr><h4>Expression of CotA laccase in Pichia pastoris and its electrocatalytic sensing application for hydrogen peroxide.</h4><p>L. Fan, M. Zhao, Y. Wang, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26062535>pubmed link</a></p><p>The CotA laccase from Bacillus subtilis WD23 was successfully overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and the production level reached 891.2 U/L. The recombinant CotA laccase was purified to homogeneity. The optimal enzymatic activity was found at pH 4.6, 6.6, and 6.8 for 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), 4-hydroxy-3, 5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde azine (SGZ), and 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol (2, 6-DMP) oxidation, respectively. The maximal enzyme activity was observed at 80 degrees C with SGZ as a substrate. The kinetic constant K m values for ABTS, SGZ, and 2, 6-DMP were 162 +/- 20, 24 +/- 2, and 166 +/- 18 muM, respectively, with corresponding k cat values of 15 +/- 1.0, 7.6 +/- 1.5, and 0.87 +/- 0.1 s-1. Remarkably, the laccase activity increased to 561.9 % of its initial activity at pH 9.0 after 7 days of incubation and the half-life of laccase inactivation was approximately 3 h at 80 degrees C, which indicated that the recombinant CotA was a highly thermo-alkali-stable laccase. Bioelectrocatalytic reduction of H2O2 by the CotA laccase was detected when the recombinant CotA was adsorbed on pyrogenation graphite electrodes. Based on the bioelectrocatalytic reduction, a mediator-free amperometric biosensor for hydrogen peroxide was designed. The linear range of the H2O2 biosensor was from 0.05 to 4.75 mM, with a detection limit of 3.1 muM. The amperometric biosensor for H2O2 by CotA-modified electrode is a novel application for CotA laccase.</p><hr><h4>Enhancing the Acyltransferase Activity of Candida antarctica Lipase A by Rational Design.</h4><p>J. Muller et al., Chembiochem 16 1791 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26058745>pubmed link</a></p><p>A few lipases, such as Candida antarctica lipase A (CAL-A), are known to possess acyltransferase activity. This enables the enzyme to synthesize fatty acid esters from natural oils and alcohols even in the presence of bulk water. Unfortunately, fatty acids are still formed in these reactions as undesired side-products. To reduce the amount of fatty acids, several CAL-A variants were rationally designed based on its crystal structure. These variants were expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, purified, and their acyltransferase/hydrolase activities were investigated by various biocatalytic approaches. Among the investigated variants, mutant Asp122Leu showed a significant decrease in the hydrolytic activity, thus reducing the side-product yield during acylation. As desired, this variant retained wild-type process-relevant features like pH profile and thermostability.</p><hr><h4>Heterologous expression and characterization of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase 4 from Penicillium purpurogenum and comparison with the other isoenzymes produced by the fungus.</h4><p>M.

In this work, the gene of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase 4 (ABF4) has been sequenced and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The gene is 1521 pb long, has no introns and codes for a protein of 506 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 26 residues. Mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.4 kDa, shows 77% identity with alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase 1 from P. purpurogenum and belongs to family 54 of the glycosyl hydrolases. Purified enzyme has a molecular mass near 68 kDa, is active on p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactofuranoside, and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with KM of 1.58 +/- 0.13 mM and 5.3 +/- 1.18 mM, respectively. The pH optimum is 4.6 and optimal temperature is 50 degrees C. The enzyme is active on sugar beet arabinan and wheat flour arabinoxylan but does not act on short arabinooligosaccharides or debranched arabinan. It shows synergistic effect on arabinose liberation from wheat arabinoxylan when combined with endoxylanase from P. purpurogenum. The properties of ABF4 have been compared with those of the other arabinofuranosidases produced by the fungus. P. purpurogenum is the first fungus possessing four biochemically characterized arabinofuranosidases. The availability of four different ABFs may be valuable for biotechnological applications.</p><hr><h4>Functional analysis of AoAtg11 in selective autophagy in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>T. Tadokoro, T. Kikuma, K. Kitamoto, Fungal Biol 119 560 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26058532>pubmed link</a></p><p>Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular degradation process in eukaryotes and consists of both non-selective and selective types. Selective autophagic processes include pexophagy, mitophagy, and the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway of yeast, in which particular vacuolar proteins, such as aminopeptidase I (Ape1), are selectively transported to vacuoles. Although selective autophagy has been mainly studied in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, there is evidence for selective autophagy in filamentous fungi; however, the details are poorly understood. In S. cerevisiae, Atg11 is a selective autophagy-specific protein that recognizes and transports substrates to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). Here, we first identified an ATG11 homologue in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae and analyzed the localization of the corresponding protein, designated AoAtg11, fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Imaging analysis revealed that AoAtg11-EGFP was localized to PAS-like structures. We next constructed an Aoatg11 disruptant of A. oryzae and showed that AoAtg11 is involved in pexophagy and mitophagy. In addition, AoAtg11 was found to be dispensable for non-selective autophagy and for transporting AoApe1 to vacuoles. Taken together, these results suggest that AoAtg11 is a selective autophagy-specific protein in A. oryzae, and has distinct molecular functions from that of S. cerevisiae Atg11.</p><hr><h4>Expression, purification and crystallization of a family 55 beta-1,3-glucanase from Chaetomium thermophilum.</h4><p>A.

While the effect of sterols on AmB activity has been intensely investigated, the role of membrane phospholipid composition has largely been ignored, and structural studies of native membranes have been hampered by their complex and disordered nature. We show for the first time that the structure of fungal membranes derived from Pichia pastoris yeast depends on the degree of lipid polyunsaturation, which has an impact on the structural consequences of AmB activity. AmB inserts in yeast membranes even in the absence of ergosterol, and forms an extra-membraneous layer whose thickness is resolved to be 4-5nm. In ergosterol-containing membranes, AmB insertion is accompanied by ergosterol extraction into this layer. The AmB-sponge mediated depletion of ergosterol from P. pastoris membranes gives rise to a significant membrane thinning effect that depends on the degree of lipid polyunsaturation. The resulting hydrophobic mismatch is likely to interfere with a much broader range of membrane protein functions than those directly involving ergosterol, and suggests that polyunsaturated lipids could boost the efficiency of AmB. Furthermore, a low degree of lipid polyunsaturation leads to least AmB insertion and may protect host cells against the toxic effects of AmB. These results provide a new framework based on lipid composition and membrane structure through which we can understand its antifungal action and develop better treatments.</p><hr><h4>A perfusion-capable microfluidic bioreactor for assessing microbial heterologous protein production.</h4><p>N.

Recombinant human microplasminogen (rhmuPlg) is a derivative of plasmin that solely consists of the catalytic domain of human plasmin and lacks the five kringle domains found in the native protein. Developing an industrial production method that provides high yields of this protein with high purity, quality, and potency is critical for preclinical research.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The human microplasminogen gene was cloned into the pPIC9K vector, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into Pichia pastoris strain GS115. The concentration of plasmin reached 510.1 mg/L of culture medium. Under fermentation conditions, the yield of rhmuPlg was 1.0 g/L. We purified rhmuPlg to 96% purity by gel-filtration and cation-exchange chromatography. The specific activity of rhmuPlg reached 23.6 U/mg. The K m of substrate hydrolysis by recombinant human microplasmin was comparable to that of human plasmin, while rhmuPlm had higher k cat /Km values than plasmin. The high purity and activity of the rhmuPlg obtained here will likely prove to be a valuable tool for studies of its application in thrombotic diseases and vitreoretinopathies.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Reliable rhmuPlg production (for use in therapeutic applications) is feasible using genetically modified P. pastoris as a host strain. The successful expression of rhmuPlg in P. pastoris lays a solid foundation for its downstream application.</p><hr><h4>Production of a Highly Protease-Resistant Fungal alpha-Galactosidase in Transgenic Maize Seeds for Simplified Feed Processing.</h4><p>W.

To simplify the feed processing, a protease-resistant alpha-galactosidase encoding gene from Gibberella sp. strain F75, aga-F75, was modified by codon optimization and heterologously expressed in the embryos of transgentic maize driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg1A. The progenies were produced by backcrossing with the commercial inbred variety Zheng58. PCR, southern blot and western blot analysis confirmed the stable integration and tissue specific expression of the modified gene, aga-F75m, in seeds over four generations. The expression level of Aga-F75M reached up to 10,000 units per kilogram of maize seeds. In comparison with its counterpart produced in Pichia pastoris strain GS115, maize seed-derived Aga-F75M showed a lower temperature optimum (50 degrees C) and lower stability over alkaline pH range, but better thermal stability at 60 degrees C to 70 degrees C and resistance to feed pelleting inactivation (80 degrees C). This is the first report of producing alpha-galactosidase in transgenic plant. The study offers an effective and economic approach for direct utilization of alpha-galactosidase-producing maize without any purification or supplementation procedures in the feed processing.</p><hr><h4>Effect of Ethanol Accumulation on Porcine Interferon-alpha Production by Pichia pastoris and Activities of Key Enzymes in Carbon Metabolism.</h4><p>J.

In the present study, taking two runs with low ethanol accumulation under 2 g/L as control group, effects of long-term (>4 h) and instantaneous high ethanol concentration (>10 g/L) on pIFN-alpha production, and activities of key enzymes in carbon metabolism were discussed. As a result, compared with control group, pIFN-alpha expression level was decreased about 4~12 folds under long-term high ethanol concentration, from the level above 3 g/L to the level under 1 g/L; pIFN-alpha expression level was decreased about 8 folds under instantaneous high ethanol concentration, reaching to the low level of 0.42 g/L. The low production of pIFN-alpha was caused by the severe inhibitory effect of ethanol on these enzymes.</p><hr><h4>Expression and purification of recombinant human neuritin from Pichia pastoris and a partial analysis of its neurobiological activity in vitro.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, to produce bioactive, soluble recombinant human neuritin protein, a portion of NRN1 was cloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPIC9K. The recombinant vector was then transformed into the methylotrophic yeast strain P. pastoris GS115, and a shaking flask method and His-tag purification strategy were utilized to express and purify neuritin protein. The resulting protein had a molecular mass of approximately 11 kDa, and subsequent functional analyses indicated that the purified neuritin promoted neurite outgrowth from embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglions, while also prolonging the survival of these ganglions, and from PC12 cells. These findings suggest that neuritin was expressed effectively in vitro and that this protein may play a role in stimulating neurite outgrowth of both dorsal root ganglions and PC12 cells. This study provides a novel strategy for the large-scale production of bioactive neuritin, which will enable further study of the biological function of this protein.</p><hr><h4>Characterization and application of a novel class II thermophilic peroxidase from Myceliophthora thermophila in biosynthesis of polycatechol.</h4><p>A.

The putative peroxidase from the genomic DNA was successfully cloned in P. pastoris X-33 under the transcriptional control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous production was greatly enhanced by the addition of hemin with a titer of 0.41 U mL(-1) peroxidase activity at the second day of incubation. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity (50 kDa) and characterized using a series of phenolic substrates that indicated similar characteristics with those of generic peroxidases. In addition, the enzyme was found thermostable, retaining its activity for temperatures up to 60 degrees C after eight hours incubation. Moreover, the enzyme displayed remarkable H2O2 stability, retaining more than 80% of its initial activity after 24h incubation in 5000-fold molar excess of H2O2. The ability of the peroxidase to polymerize catechol at high superoxide concentrations, together with its high thermostability and substrate specificity, indicate a potential commercial significance of the enzyme.</p><hr><h4>Scaling-up the synthesis of myristate glucose ester catalyzed by a CALB-displaying Pichia pastoris whole-cell biocatalyst.</h4><p>D.

This study addresses the feasibility of using Pp-CALB in large scale glucose fatty acid esters production. 1,2-O-Isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose (IpGlc) was used as the acyl acceptor to overcome the low solubility of glucose in an organic solvent and to avoid the addition of toxic co-solvents. IpGlc significantly improved the Pp-CALB catalyzing esterification efficiency when using long chain fatty acids as the acyl donor. Under the preferred operating conditions (50 degrees C, 40 g/L molecular sieve dosage and 200 rpm mixing intensity), 60.5% of IpGlc converted to 6-O-myristate-1, 2-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose (C14-IpGlc) after a 96-h reaction in a 2-L stirred reactor. In a 5-L pilot scale test, Pp-CALB also showed a similar substrate conversion rate of 55.4% and excellent operational stability. After C14-IpGlc was collected, 70% trifluoroacetic acid was adopted to hydrolyze C14-IpGlc to myristate glucose ester (C14-Glc) with a high yield of 95.3%. In conclusion, Pp-CALB is a powerful biocatalyst available for industrial synthesis, and this study describes an applicable and economical process for the large scale production of myristate glucose ester.</p><hr><h4>Toxocara canis mucins among other excretory-secretory antigens induce in vitro secretion of cytokines by mouse splenocytes.</h4><p>E.

Recombinant mucins were produced in Pichia pastoris yeast, and Toxocara excretory-secretory (TES) antigens were collected from in vitro culture of L2 larvae. Tc-MUC-2, Tc-MUC-3, Tc-MUC-4, and Tc-MUC-5 were expressed as glycoproteins and were specifically recognized by Toxocara canis-infected dog serum antibodies. Mouse splenocytes stimulated with recombinant mucins produced IL-5, IL-6, and TGF-beta. Cell stimulation with whole TES products was more effective and resulted in secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-beta and downregulation of TNF-alpha production. IFN-gamma and IL-17 secretion was noted only after ConA treatment. Cells originating from infected animals produced significantly smaller amounts of these two cytokines compared to control cells, which suggests that Th1 and Th17 response in infected mice is strongly inhibited. However, splenocyte stimulation with both TES and ConA upregulated the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17. This shows that TES antigens have strong immunomodulatory properties and are able to induce a broad range of effects on murine immune cells.</p><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of the Monilinia fructicola CYP51 (MfCYP51) gene in Pichia pastoris confirms the mode of action of the novel fungicide, SYP-Z048.</h4><p>F.

Previous studies have shown that EBIs target the proteins from a range of genes, including CYP51, ERG2 and/or ERG24, and ERG27, which are involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. In the current study the ERG2, ERG24, and ERG27 genes were cloned from wild type and resistant mutants of Monilinia fructicola in an attempt to clarify the target site of SYP-Z048. Comparative analysis of the deduced aa sequence of these genes, as well as CYP51, revealed several point mutations that resulted in amino acid variation among the sensitive and resistant isolates. However, sensitivity assays indicated that only one, the substitution of phenylalanine (F) for the tyrosine (Y) at 136 in CYP51, was correlated with reduced sensitivity to SYP-Z048. Heterologous expression of MfCYP51-136Y (MfCYP136Y) and MfCYP51-136F (MfCYP136F) in Pichia pastoris revealed that MfCYP136F significantly reduced sensitivity to SYP-Z048, increasing the average EC50 of the transformants 11-fold relative to those carrying MfCYP136Y. However, neither the additional copy of MfCYP136Y nor multiple copies of MfCYP136F were found to reduce sensitivity relative to the empty vector control or single copy transformants, respectively. Molecular docking experiments using SYP-Z048 with HsCYP145Y and the mutated version HsCYP145F as substitutes for MfCYP136Y and MfCYP136F, respectively, indicated that the reduced affinity of HsCYP145F for SYP-Z048 resulted from the loss of a hydrogen bond between the fungicide and the active site. Taken together these results indicate that MfCYP51 is the major target site of SYP-Z048 in M. fructicola, which has important implications for the resistance management of this fungicide in the field.</p><hr><h4>Biochemical characterization of three distinct polygalacturonases from Neosartorya fischeri P1.</h4><p>X.

The purified recombinant proteins exhibited some distinguished properties. In comparison with other counterparts, NfPG I showed the highest specific activity (40, 123 U/mg), NfPG II had the highest temperature optimum (65 degrees C), and the pH optimum of NfPG III was the lowest (3.5). The orders of their thermostability and resistance to chemicals tested were NfPG II>NfPG III>NfPG I and NfPG II>NfPG I>NfPG III, respectively. Combinations of these enzymes showed better performance than individuals in the processing and clarification of apple and strawberry juice. These results suggest that N. fischeri polygalacturonases have great application potentials in the food industry for juice production.</p><hr><h4>Automated pipeline for rapid production and screening of HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies using pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

Advances in automated screening and liquid handling have resulted in the ability to discover antigen-specific antibodies either directly from human blood or from various combinatorial libraries (phage, bacteria, or yeast). There remain, however, bottlenecks in the cloning, expression and evaluation of such lead antibodies identified in primary screens that hinder high-throughput screening. As such, "hit-to-lead identification" remains both expensive and time-consuming. By combining the advantages of overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) and a genetically stable yet easily manipulatable microbial expression host Pichia pastoris, we have developed an automated pipeline for the rapid production and screening of full-length antigen-specific mAbs.

In this study, the P4H gene was constructed in pGAPZalphaB plasmid and pPICZB plasmid respectively. These two plasmids were transformed in P. pastoris #1 that carrying COL3A1. Colony PCR analysis and sequencing after electroporation P. pastoris GS115 showed that the target gene had inserted successfully. The results of reverse transcript-qPCR, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and LC-MS/MS analysis of the rhCOL3A1 demonstrated that the P4H was expressed successfully. Besides, it is noted that low copy number, constitutive system was suitable for hydroxylated rhCOL3A1.</p><p><strong> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> Successful co-expression of recombinant human collagen alpha1 (III) (rhCOL3A1) and human prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4H) in Picha pastoris GS115, simultaneously results in the acquisition of rhCOL3A1 with hydroxylation of proline (Hyp). Further, this experiment also discusses that the high or low copy numbers and different promoters affect the Hyp degree of rhCOL3A1. Selecting more appropriate strains can express high degree Hyp of rhCOL3A1. This work will be helpful to the collagen structure study.</p><hr><h4>Cultivation strategies to enhance productivity of Pichia pastoris: A review.</h4><p>V. Looser et al., Biotechnol Adv   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26027890>pubmed link</a></p><p>Pichia pastoris, a methylotrophic yeast, is an established system for the production of heterologous proteins, particularly biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes. To maximise and optimise the production of recombinant products, recent molecular research has focused on numerous issues including the design of expression vectors, optimisation of gene copy number, co-expression of secretory proteins such as chaperones, engineering of glycosylation and secretory pathways, etc. However, the physiological effects of different cultivation strategies are often difficult to separate from the molecular effects of the gene construct (e.g., cellular stress through over-expression or incorrect post-translational processing). Hence, overall system optimisation is difficult, even though it is urgently required in order to describe and understand the behaviour of new molecular constructs. This review focuses on particular aspects of recombinant protein production related to variations in biomass growth and their implications for strain design and screening, as well as on the concept of rational comparisons between cultivation systems for the development of specific production processes in bioreactors. The relationship between specific formation rates of secreted recombinant proteins, qp, and specific growth rates, mu, has been analysed in a conceptual attempt to compare different systems, particularly those based on AOX1/methanol and GAP/glucose, and this has now evolved into a pivotal concept for bioprocess engineering of P. pastoris.</p><hr><h4>Sweetness characterization of recombinant human lysozyme.</h4><p>M. Matano et al., Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol 188 8 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26027787>pubmed link</a></p><p>Lysozyme, a bacteriolytic enzyme, is widely distributed in nature and is a component of the innate immune system. It is established that chicken egg lysozyme elicits sweetness. However, the sweetness of human milk lysozyme, which is vital for combating microbial infections of the gastrointestinal tract of breast-fed infants, has not been characterized. This study aimed to assess the elicitation of sweetness using recombinant mammalian lysozymes expressed in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant human lysozyme (h-LZ) and other mammalian lysozymes of mouse, dog, cat and bovine milk elicited similar sweetness as determined using a sensory test, whereas bovine stomach lysozyme (bs-LZ) did not. Assays of cell cultures showed that h-LZ activated the human sweet taste receptor hT1R2/hT1R3, whereas bs-LZ did not. Point mutations confirmed that the sweetness of h-LZ was independent of enzyme activity and substrate-binding sites, although acidic amino acid residues of bs-LZ played a significant role in diminishing sweetness. Therefore, we conclude that elicitation of sweetness is a ubiquitous function among all lysozymes including mammalian lysozymes. These findings may provide novel insights into the biological implications of T1R2/T1R3-activation by mammalian lysozyme in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. However, the function of lysozyme within species lacking the functional sweet taste receptor gene, such as cat, is currently unknown.</p><hr><h4>Comparison of two codon optimization strategies enhancing recombinant Sus scrofa lysozyme production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

For improving expression efficiency of recombinant lysozyme from Sus scrofa, two genes respectively designed by the most used codon optimization strategies, "one amino acid one codon" and "codon randomization", were synthesized and expressed in Pichia pastoris X&mdash;33. At shaking flask level, Sus scrofa lysozyme (SSL) under two conditions had a highest activity of 153.33+/-10.41 and 538.33+/-15.18 U/mL after a 5 days induction of 1% methanol, with secreted protein concentration 80.03+/-1.94 and 239.60+/-4.16 mg/L, respectively. Compared with the original SSL gene, the expression of optimized SSL gene by the second strategy showed a 2.6 fold higher level, while the first method had no obvious improvement in production. In total secreted protein, the proportions of recombinant SSL encoded by the original gene, first method optimized gene and the second&mdash;strategy optimized one were 75.06+/-0.25%, 74.56+/-0.14% and 79.00+/-0.14%, respectively, with the same molecular weight about 18 kDa, optimum acidity pH 6.0 and optimum temperature 35degC.</p><hr><h4>Methyl labeling and TROSY NMR spectroscopy of proteins expressed in the eukaryote Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L.

Specific (13)C labeling of aliphatic methyl groups and perdeuteration has been limited primarily to proteins expressed in E. coli, preventing studies of many eukaryotic proteins of physiological and biomedical significance. We demonstrate the feasibility of efficient (13)C isoleucine delta1-methyl labeling in a deuterated background in an established eukaryotic expression host, Pichia pastoris, and show that this method can be used to label the eukaryotic protein actin, which cannot be expressed in bacteria. This approach will enable NMR studies of previously intractable targets.</p><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris production of a prolyl 4-hydroxylase derived from Chondrosia reniformis sponge: A new biotechnological tool for the recombinant production of marine collagen.</h4><p>M. Pozzolini et al., J Biotechnol 208 28 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26022422>pubmed link</a></p><p>Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) is a alpha2beta2 tetramer catalyzing the post-translational hydroxylation of prolines in collagen. Its recombinant production is mainly pursued to realize biotechnological tools able to generate animal contaminant-free hydroxylated collagen. One promising candidate for biomedical applications is the collagen extracted from the marine sponge Chondrosia reniformis, because of its biocompatibility and because is devoid of the health risks associated with bovine and porcine collagens. Here we report on the production and selection, by enzymatic and biomolecular analyses, of a triple transformed Pichia pastoris strain expressing a stable P4H tetramer derived from C. reniformis sponge and a hydroxylated non fibrillar procollagen polypeptide from the same animal. The percentage of recombinant procollagen hydroxylated prolines inside the transformed yeast was of 36.3% analyzed by mass spectrometry indicating that the recombinant enzyme is active on its natural substrate inside the yeast cell host. Furthermore, the recombinant sponge P4H has the ability to hydroxylate its natural substrate in both X and Y positions in the Xaa-Yaa-Gly collagenous triplets. In conclusion this Pichia system seems ideal for high-level production of hydroxylated sponge- or marine-derived collagen polypeptides as well as of conotoxins or other marine proteins of high pharmacological interest needing this particular post-translational modification.</p><hr><h4>Recombinant hepatitis C virus-envelope protein 2 interactions with low-density lipoprotein/CD81 receptors.</h4><p>A.

The aim of this work was to produce recombinant E2B and E2Y HCV proteins in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively, and to study their interactions with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and CD81 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the ECV304 bladder carcinoma cell line. To investigate the effects of human LDL and differences in protein structure (glycosylated or not) on binding efficiency, the recombinant proteins were either associated or not associated with lipoproteins before being assayed. The immunoreactivity of the recombinant proteins was analysed using pooled serum samples that were either positive or negative for hepatitis C. The cells were immunophenotyped by LDLr and CD81 using flow cytometry. Binding and binding inhibition assays were performed in the presence of LDL, foetal bovine serum (FCS) and specific antibodies. The results revealed that binding was reduced in the absence of FCS, but that the addition of human LDL rescued and increased binding capacity. In HUVEC cells, the use of antibodies to block LDLr led to a significant reduction in the binding of E2B and E2Y. CD81 antibodies did not affect E2B and E2Y binding. In ECV304 cells, blocking LDLr and CD81 produced similar effects, but they were not as marked as those that were observed in HUVEC cells. In conclusion, recombinant HCV E2 is dependent on LDL for its ability to bind to LDLr in HUVEC and ECV304 cells. These findings are relevant because E2 acts to anchor HCV to host cells; therefore, high blood levels of LDL could enhance viral infectivity in chronic hepatitis C patients.</p><hr><h4>In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of afucosylated anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody produced in glycoengineered Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Gomathinayagam et al., J Biotechnol 208 13 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015261>pubmed link</a></p><p>Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has been successfully used for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and is currently extended for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). New developments in MM therapeutics have achieved significant survival gains in patients but the disease still remains incurable. Elotuzumab (HuLuc63), an anti-CS1 monoclonal IgG1 antibody, is believed to induce anti-tumor activity and MM cytotoxicity through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and inhibition of MM cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Modulations of the Fc glycan composition at the N297 site by selective mutations or afucosylation have been explored as strategies to develop bio-better therapeutics with enhanced ADCC activity. Afucosylated therapeutic antibodies with enhanced ADCC activity have been reported to possess greater efficacy in tumor growth inhibition at lower doses when compared to fucosylated therapeutic antibodies. The N-linked glycosylation pathway in Pichia pastoris has been engineered to produce human-like N-linked glycosylation with uniform afucosylated complex type glycans. The purpose of this study was to compare afucosylated anti-CS1 mAb expressed in glycoengineered Pichia pastoris with fucosylated anti-CS1 mAb expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells through in vitro ADCC and in vivo tumor inhibition models. Our results indicate that Fc glycosylation is critical for in vivo efficacy and afucosylated anti-CS1 mAb expressed in glycoengineered Pichia pastoris shows a better in vivo efficacy in tumor regression when compared to fucosylated anti-CS1 mAb expressed in HEK293 cells. Glycoengineered Pichia pastoris could provide an alternative platform for generating homogeneous afucosylated recombinant antibodies where Fc mediated immune effector function is important for efficacy.</p><hr><h4>Combined use of GAP and AOX1 promoters and optimization of culture conditions to enhance expression of Rhizomucor miehei lipase.</h4><p>D.

In this study, a series of measures such as codon optimization, propeptide addition, combined use of GAP and AOX1 promoters, and optimization of culture conditions were employed to increase the expression of RML. Three transformants of the constitutive-inducible combined Pichia pastoris strains were generated by transforming the pGAPZalphaA-rml vector into the pPIC9K-rml/GS115 strain, which resulted in high-expression yields of RML. Using the shake flask method, highest enzyme activity corresponding to 140 U/mL was observed in the strain 3-17, which was about sixfold higher than that of pPIC9K-rml/GS115 or pGAPZalphaA-rml/GS115. After optimization of culture conditions by response surface methodology, the lipolytic activity of strain 3-17 reached 175 U/mL in shake flasks. An increase in the copy number simultaneously with the synergistic effect provided by two promoters led to enhanced degree of protein expression.</p><hr><h4>Cell Surface Display and Characterization of Rhizopus oryzae Lipase in Pichia pastoris Using Sed1p as an Anchor Protein.</h4><p>W.

A yeast cell surface display plasmid pPICZalphaA-rol-histag-sed1p was constructed by fusing rol and sed1p gene fragments into the plasmid pPICZalphaA, followed by introducing recombinant plasmid into P. pastoris cells. Surface display levels were monitored by Western Blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. The activity of displaying lipase obtained from recombinant mutS reached at 60 U/g-dry cell. In addition, the displaying lipase was stable in broad ranges of temperatures and pH, with the optimum temperature at 40 degrees C and pH 7.5. These results indicate that the P. pastoris displaying lipase may have potential in whole-cell biocatalyst.</p><hr><h4>Surra Sero K-SeT, a new immunochromatographic test for serodiagnosis of Trypanosoma evansi infection in domestic animals.</h4><p>H. Birhanu et al., Vet Parasitol 211 153 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26012857>pubmed link</a></p><p>Trypanosoma evansi, the causative agent of surra, infects different domestic and wild animals and has a wide geographical distribution. It is mechanically transmitted mainly by haematophagous flies. Parasitological techniques are commonly used for the diagnosis of surra but have limited sensitivity. Therefore, serodiagnosis based on the detection of T. evansi specific antibodies is recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Recently, we developed a new antibody detection test for the serodiagnosis of T. evansi infection, the Surra Sero K-SeT. Surra Sero K-SeT is an immunochromatographic test (ICT) that makes use of recombinant variant surface glycoprotein rVSG RoTat 1.2, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. In this study, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of the Surra Sero K-SeT and the Card Agglutination Test for T. evansi Trypanosomososis (CATT/T. evansi) with immune trypanolysis (TL) as reference test on a total of 806 sera from camels, water buffaloes, horses, bovines, sheep, dogs and alpacas. Test agreement was highest between Surra Sero K-SeT and TL (kappa=0.91, 95% CI 0.841-0.979) and somewhat lower between CATT/T. evansi and TL (kappa=0.85, 95% CI 0.785-0.922) and Surra Sero K-SeT and CATT/T. evansi (kappa=0.81, 95% CI 0.742-0.878). The Surra Sero K-SeT displayed a somewhat lower overall specificity than CATT/T. evansi (94.8% versus 98.3%, chi(2)=13.37, p<0.001) but a considerably higher sensitivity (98.1% versus 84.4%, chi(2)=33.39, p<0.001). We conclude that the Surra Sero K-SeT may become an alternative for the CATT/T. evansi for sensitive detection of antibodies against T. evansi in domestic animals.</p><hr><h4>Enhanced expression of the E(rns) protein of classical swine fever virus in yeast and its application in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals.</h4><p>Y.

Although a mandatory vaccination with the modified live vaccine C-strain has been implemented in China for decades, CSF remains a serious threat to the swine industry. To facilitate the control and eradication of CSF in China, the E2-based marker vaccine rAdV-SFV-E2, an adenovirus-delivered, alphavirus replicon-vectored vaccine, has been developed. Accordingly, an accompanying discriminatory test that allows differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is required. Here, the enhanced expression of E(rns) protein of CSFV was achieved in the methyltropic yeast Pichia pastoris by codon-optimization of the E(rns) gene, and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on the yeast-expressed E(rns) (yE(rns)) was developed and evaluated. The optimized iELISA was able to detect CSFV-specific antibodies in the serum samples from the CSFV-infected pigs as early as 6 days post-infection, and discriminate the CSFV-infected pigs from those vaccinated with rAdV-SFV-E2. The iELISA was evaluated using a panel of swine sera, and showed comparable sensitivity (94.6%) and specificity (97.1%), and the consistence rates with the virus neutralization test were 96.8% for CSFV-infected swine sera, 83.3% for C-strain-vaccinated swine sera, and 95.0% for field swine sera. In addition, the iELISA showed higher sensitivity (90.4%) compared with PrioCHECK CSFV E(rns) (59.6%). Taken together, the yE(rns)-based iELISA is specific and sensitive, representing a promising DIVA test for E2-based marker vaccines against CSF.</p><hr><h4>Tandem-yeast expression system for engineering and producing unspecific peroxygenase.</h4><p>P.

Recently, the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita was evolved for secretion and activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [8]. In the current work, we describe a tandem-yeast expression system for UPO engineering and large scale production. By harnessing the directed evolution process in S. cerevisiae, the beneficial mutations for secretion enabled Pichia pastoris to express the evolved UPO under the control of the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promoter. Whilst secretion levels were found similar for both yeasts in flask fermentation ( approximately 8mg/L), the recombinant UPO from P. pastoris showed a 27-fold enhanced production in fed-batch fermentation (217mg/L). The P. pastoris UPO variant maintained similar biochemical properties of the S. cerevisiae counterpart in terms of catalytic constants, pH activity profiles and thermostability. Thus, this tandem-yeast expression system ensures the engineering of UPOs to use them in future industrial applications as well as large scale production.</p><hr><h4>Cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes in Fusarium commune transcriptome and functional characterization of three identified xylanases.</h4><p>Y.

The secreted lignocellulolytic enzymes of Fusarium species have not been investigated comprehensively, however. In this study we compared cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes of classical fungal enzyme producers with those of Fusarium species. The results indicated that Fusarium species are robust cellulose and hemicellulose degraders. Wheat bran, carboxymethylcellulose and xylan-based growth media induced a broad spectrum of lignocellulolytic enzymes in Fusarium commune. Prediction of the cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes in the F. commune transcriptome using peptide pattern recognition revealed 147 genes encoding glycoside hydrolases and six genes encoding lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (AA9 and AA11), including all relevant cellulose decomposing enzymes (GH3, GH5, GH6, GH7, GH9, GH45 and AA9), and abundant hemicellulases. We further applied peptide pattern recognition to reveal nine and seven subfamilies of GH10 and GH11 family enzymes, respectively. The uncharacterized XYL10A, XYL10B and XYL11 enzymes of F. commune were classified, respectively, into GH10 subfamily 1, subfamily 3 and GH11 subfamily 1. These xylanases were successfully expressed in the PichiaPink system with the following properties: the purified recombinant XYL10A had interesting high specific activity; XYL10B was active at alkaline conditions with both endo-1,4-beta-d-xylanase and beta-xylosidase activities; and XYL11 was a true xylanase characterized by high substrate specificity. These results indicate that F. commune with genetic modification is a promising source of enzymes for the decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass.</p><hr><h4>Production of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid from cannabigerolic acid by whole cells of Pichia (Komagataella) pastoris expressing Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase from Cannabis sativa L.</h4><p>B.

Fusaruside (1) is a 10,11-unsaturated immunosuppressive fungal sphingolipid with medical potentials for treating liver injury and colitis, but its poor natural abundance bottlenecks its druggability. Here, fusaruside is clarified biosynthetically, and its efficacy-related 10,11-double bond can be generated under the regioselective catalysis of an unprecedented Delta10(E)-sphingolipid desaturase (Delta10(E)-SD). Delta10(E)-SD shares 17.7% amino acid sequence similarity with a C9-unmethylated Delta10-sphingolipid desaturase derived from a marine diatom, and 55.7% with Delta8(E)-SD from Fusarium graminearum. Heterologous expression of Delta10(E)-SD in Pichia pastoris has been established to facilitate a reliable generation of 1 through the Delta10(E)-SD catalyzed desaturation of cerebroside B (2), an abundant fungal sphingolipid. Site directed mutageneses show that the conserved histidines of Delta10(E)-SD are essential for the 10,11-desaturation catalysis, which is also preconditioned by the C9-methylation of the substrate. Moreover, Delta10(E)-SD confers improved survival and faster growth to fungal strains at low temperature and high salinity, in parallel with to higher contents of 1 in the mycelia. Collectively, the investigation describes a new Delta10(E)-sphingolipid desaturase with its heterologous expression fundamentalizing a biotechnological supply of 1, and eases the follow-up clarification of the immunosuppression and stress-tolerance mechanism.</p><hr><h4>Enhancing ergosterol production in Pichia pastoris GS115 by overexpressing squalene synthase gene from Glycyrrhiza uralensis.</h4><p>Y.

SQS1 gene from G. uralensis (GuSQS1) was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Six recombinant P. pastoris strains containing different copy number of GuSQS1 were constructed. HPLC was used to assay the level of ergosterol in all transgenic P. pastoris strains containing GuSQS1. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of ergosterol in all of the transgenic P. pastoris containing GuSQS1 were higher than that in the negative control. And with the increase of copy number of GuSQS1, the content of ergosterol showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. The contents of ergosterol in 10-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris and 47-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris were significantly higher than that in the rest recombinant P. pastoris strains. In conclusion, the CNVs of GuSQS1 influence the content of secondary metabolites in the MVA pathway. The present study provides a basis for over-expressing GuSQS1 and increasing the content of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis cultivars.</p><hr><h4>High-level expression of pseudolysin, the extracellular elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in Escherichia coli and its purification.</h4><p>O.

Pseudolysin has been identified as a robust drug target and a biotechnologically important enzyme in the tanning industry. Previous attempts to purify active pseudolysin from P. aeruginosa or by expression in Escherichia coli yielded low quantities. Considerable expression and purification of secreted pseudolysin from Pichia pastoris has been reported but it is time-consuming and not cost-effective. We report the successful large-scale expression of pseudolysin in E. coli and purification of the correctly folded and active protein. The lasB gene that codes for the enzymatically active mature 33-kilodalton pseudolysin was expressed with a histidine tag under the control of the T7 promoter. Pseudolysin expressed highly in E. coli and was solubilized and purified in 8M urea by metal affinity chromatography. The protein was simultaneously further purified, refolded and buffer-exchanged on a preparative Superdex 200 column by a modified urea reverse-gradient size exclusion chromatography. Using this technique, precipitation of pseudolysin was completely eliminated. Refolded pseudolysin was found to be active as assessed by its ability to hydrolyze N-succinyl-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide. The purification scheme yielded approximately 40 mg of pseudolysin per liter of expression culture and specific activity of 3.2U/mg of protein using N-succinyl-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide as substrate. This approach provides a reproducible strategy for high-level expression and purification of active metallopeptidases and perhaps other inclusion body-forming and precipitation-prone proteins.</p><hr><h4>Heterologous expression and enzymatic characterization of fructosyltransferase from Aspergillus niger in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

The yield of recombinant FTase in a 5-L fermentor reached 1020.0U/mL after 96h of induction, which was 1160.4 times higher that of native FTase from A. niger YZ59. The specific activity of recombinant FTase was 6.8x104U/mg. The optimum temperature and pH of the recombinant FTase were 55 degrees C and 5.5, respectively. The recombinant FTase was stable below 40 degrees C and at pH from 3.0 to 10.0. Using sucrose as the substrate, the Km and Vmax values of recombinant FTase were 159.8g/L and 0.66g/(Lmin), respectively. The turnover number (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of recombinant FTase was 1.1x104min-1 and 68.8L/(gmin), respectively. The recombinant FTase was slightly activated by 5mM Ni2+, Mg2+, K+, Fe3+, or Mn2+, but inhibited by all other metal ions (Na+, Li+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+). The highest yield of fructooligosaccharides for purified FTase reached approximately 343.3g/L (w/v). This is the first study reporting the heterologous expression of FTases from A. niger in P. pastoris.

Quick, J Biol Chem 290 16372 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25971966>pubmed link</a></p><p>The human Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) has been suggested to transport alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent used in therapeutic applications, e.g. in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular basis of the cellular delivery of LA and in particular the stereospecificity of the transport process are not well understood. Here, we expressed recombinant hSMVT in Pichia pastoris and used affinity chromatography to purify the detergent-solubilized protein followed by reconstitution of hSMVT in lipid bilayers. Using a combined approach encompassing radiolabeled LA transport and equilibrium binding studies in conjunction with the stabilized R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers and the R,S-(+/-) racemic mixture of LA or lipoamide, we identified the biologically active form of LA, R-LA, to be the physiological substrate of hSMVT. Interaction of R-LA with hSMVT is strictly dependent on Na(+). Under equilibrium conditions, hSMVT can simultaneously bind approximately 2 molecules of R-LA in a biphasic binding isotherm with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.9 and 7.4 mum. Transport of R-LA in the oocyte and reconstituted system is exclusively dependent on Na(+) and exhibits an affinity of approximately 3 mum. Measuring transport with known amounts of protein in proteoliposomes containing hSMVT in outside-out orientation yielded a catalytic turnover number (kcat) of about 1 s(-1), a value that is well in agreement with other Na(+)-coupled transporters. Our data suggest that hSMVT-mediated transport is highly specific for R-LA at our tested concentration range, a finding with wide ramifications for the use of LA in therapeutic applications.</p><hr><h4>Contribution of Disulfide Bridges to the Thermostability of a Type A Feruloyl Esterase from Aspergillus usamii.</h4><p>X. Yin et al., PLoS One 10 e0126864 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25969986>pubmed link</a></p><p>The contribution of disulfide bridges to the thermostability of a type A feruloyl esterase (AuFaeA) from Aspergillus usamii E001 was studied by introducing an extra disulfide bridge or eliminating a native one from the enzyme. MODIP and DbD, two computational tools that can predict the possible disulfide bridges in proteins for thermostability improvement, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to design the extra disulfide bridge. One residue pair A126-N152 was chosen, and the respective amino acid residues were mutated to cysteine. The wild-type AuFaeA and its variants were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The temperature optimum of the recombinant (re-) AuFaeAA126C-N152C was increased by 6 degrees C compared to that of re-AuFaeA. The thermal inactivation half-lives of re-AuFaeAA126C-N152C at 55 and 60 degrees C were 188 and 40 min, which were 12.5- and 10-folds longer than those of re-AuFaeA. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of re-AuFaeAA126C-N152C was similar to that of re-AuFaeA. Additionally, after elimination of each native disulfide bridge in AuFaeA, a great decrease in expression level and at least 10 degrees C decrease in thermal stability of recombinant AuEaeA variants were also observed.</p><hr><h4>High-level expression and characterization of a thermophilic beta-mannanase from Aspergillus niger in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

It was expressed in P. pastoris GS115 from a constitutive expression vector pHBM-905 M. MAN-P reached 594 mg/l in shake-flasks after 192 h induction. On production in a 5 l fermenter, the yield of MAN-P reached ~3.5 mg/ml and the enzyme activity was 1612 U/ml. The enzyme exhibited a maximum activity of 3049 U/ml at 80 degrees C and retained 60 % enzyme activity at 80 degrees C for 2 h. The pH optimum was 4.5 and the enzyme was stable over the pH range 1.5-11.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The thermostability of MAN-P is higher than other known fungal mannanases and the expression and thermophilic properties make MAN-P useful for industrial applications.</p><hr><h4>Polyglycine hydrolases: Fungal beta-lactamase-like endoproteases that cleave polyglycine regions within plant class IV chitinases.</h4><p>T.

Price, Protein Sci 24 1147 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25966977>pubmed link</a></p><p>Polyglycine hydrolases are secreted fungal proteases that cleave glycine-glycine peptide bonds in the inter-domain linker region of specific plant defense chitinases. Previously, we reported the catalytic activity of polyglycine hydrolases from the phytopathogens Epicoccum sorghi (Es-cmp) and Cochliobolus carbonum (Bz-cmp). Here we report the identity of their encoding genes and the primary amino acid sequences of the proteins responsible for these activities. Peptides from a tryptic digest of Es-cmp were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and the spectra obtained were matched to a draft genome sequence of E. sorghi. From this analysis, a 642 amino acid protein containing a predicted beta-lactamase catalytic region of 280 amino acids was identified. Heterologous strains of the yeast Pichia pastoris were created to express this protein and its homolog from C. carbonum from their cDNAs. Both strains produced recombinant proteins with polyglycine hydrolase activity as shown by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS based assays. Site directed mutagenesis was used to mutate the predicted catalytic serine of Es-cmp to glycine, resulting in loss of catalytic activity. BLAST searching of publicly available fungal genomes identified full-length homologous proteins in 11 other fungi of the class Dothideomycetes, and in three fungi of the related class Sordariomycetes while significant BLAST hits extended into the phylum Basidiomycota. Multiple sequence alignment led to the identification of a network of seven conserved tryptophans that surround the beta-lactamase-like region. This is the first report of a predicted beta-lactamase that is an endoprotease.</p><hr><h4>Overexpression of functional human oxidosqualene cyclase in Escherichia coli.</h4><p>C. Kurten, M. Uhlen, P. O. Syren, Protein Expr Purif   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962741>pubmed link</a></p><p>The generation of multicyclic scaffolds from linear oxidosqualene by enzymatic polycyclization catalysis constitutes a cornerstone in biology for the generation of bioactive compounds. Human oxidosqualene cyclase (hOSC) is a membrane-bound triterpene cyclase that catalyzes the formation of the tetracyclic steroidal backbone, a key step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Protein expression of hOSC and other eukaryotic oxidosqualene cyclases has traditionally been performed in yeast and insect cells, which has resulted in protein yields of 2.7mg protein/g cells (hOSC in Pichia pastoris) after 48h of expression. Herein we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first functional expression of hOSC in the model organism Escherichia coli. Using a codon-optimized gene and a membrane extraction procedure for which detergent is immediately added after cell lysis, a protein yield of 2.9mg/g bacterial cells was achieved after four hours of expression. It is envisaged that the isolation of high amounts of active eukaryotic oxidosqualene cyclase in an easy to handle bacterial system will be beneficial in pharmacological, biochemical and biotechnological applications.</p><hr><h4>Characterization of a new sn-1,3-regioselective triacylglycerol lipase from Malbranchea cinnamomea.</h4><p>X. Tong, P. K. Busk, L. Lange, Biotechnol Appl Biochem   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959497>pubmed link</a></p><p>The thermophilic ascomycetous fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea produces lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) that allow it to grow efficiently on medium containing triacylglycerol substrates such as plant oils or tributyrin as sole carbon source. In the transcriptome of M. cinnamomea grown on olive oil, we found one cDNA sequence encoding a putative extracellular lipase. This gene, termed as MclipA, was cloned and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein, rMclipA, catalyzed the hydrolysis of short-chain fatty acid ester such as p-nitrophenyl butyrate (C4) and long-chain fatty acid ester such as p-nitrophenyl myristate (C14). These results indicate that MclipA is a true triacylglycerol lipase. For rMclipA, the optimum lipase activity was obtained at 45 degrees C, and more than 93% of enzyme activity was retained after 24 H of incubation at temperatures up to 50 degrees C. rMclipA was active toward p-nitrophenyl esters of various carbon chain lengths with peak activity on long-chain fatty acid (C14). rMclipA displayed high sn-1,3-regioselectivity on hydrolyzing triolein. rMclipA can catalyze oleic acid methyl ester synthesis resulting in a 71% esterification degree after 24 H of reaction at 40 degrees C. These properties suggest that rMclipA has potential application in, for example, selective hydrolysis of oil, modification of triacylglycerol, and production of biodiesel.</p><hr><h4>Diphtheria-toxin based anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin for targeting human CCR4(+) cells in vivo.</h4><p>Z. Wang et al., Mol Oncol 9 1458 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25958791>pubmed link</a></p><p>CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) has attracted much attention as a promising therapeutic drug target for CCR4(+) tumor cells and Tregs. CCR4 is expressed on some tumor cells such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), adult peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). CCR4 is also expressed on majority of Tregs, mainly effector Tregs. In this study we have successfully developed three versions of diphtheria-toxin based anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins (monovalent, bivalent and single-chain fold-back diabody). Binding analysis by flow cytometry showed that all three versions of the anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins bound to the human CCR4(+) tumor cell line as well as CCR4(+) human PBMC. The bivalent isoform bound stronger than its monovalent counterpart and the single-chain foldback diabody isoform was the strongest among the three versions. In vitro efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform was 20 fold more potent in inhibiting cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in human CCR4(+) tumor cells compared to the monovalent anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin. The single-chain fold-back diabody isoform was 10 fold more potent than its bivalent counterpart and 200 fold more potent than its monovalent counterpart. The in vivo efficacy was assessed using a human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mouse model. The immunotoxin significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor gamma(-/-) (NSG) mice injected with human CCR4(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells compared with the control group. This novel anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin is a promising drug candidate for targeting human CCR4(+) tumor cells and Tregs in vivo.</p><hr><h4>Conserved Amblyomma americanum tick Serpin19, an inhibitor of blood clotting factors Xa and XIa, trypsin and plasmin, has anti-haemostatic functions.</h4><p>T. K. Kim et al., Int J Parasitol 45 613 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25957161>pubmed link</a></p><p>Tick saliva serine protease inhibitors (serpins) facilitate tick blood meal feeding through inhibition of protease mediators of host defense pathways. We previously identified a highly conserved Amblyomma americanum serpin 19 that is characterised by its reactive center loop being 100% conserved in ixodid ticks. In this study, biochemical characterisation reveals that the ubiquitously transcribed A. americanum serpin 19 is an anti-coagulant protein, inhibiting the activity of five of the eight serine protease blood clotting factors. Pichia pastoris-expressed recombinant (r) A. americanum serpin 19 inhibits the enzyme activity of trypsin, plasmin and blood clotting factors (f) Xa and XIa, with stoichiometry of inhibition estimated at 5.1, 9.4, 23.8 and 28, respectively. Similar to typical inhibitory serpins, recombinant A. americanum serpin 19 forms irreversible complexes with trypsin, fXa and fXIa. At a higher molar excess of recombinant A. americanum serpin 19, fXIIa is inhibited by 82.5%, and thrombin (fIIa), fIXa, chymotrypsin and tryptase are inhibited moderately by 14-29%. In anti-hemostatic functional assays, recombinant A. americanum serpin 19 inhibits thrombin but not ADP and cathepsin G activated platelet aggregation, delays clotting in recalcification and thrombin time assays by up to 250s, and up to 40s in the activated partial thromboplastin time assay. Given A. americanum serpin 19 high cross-tick species conservation, and specific reactivity of recombinant A. americanum serpin 19 with antibodies to A. americanum tick saliva proteins, we conclude that recombinant A. americanum serpin 19 is a potential candidate for development of a universal tick vaccine.</p><hr><h4>Antimicrobial activity of recombinant mature bovine neutrophil beta-defensin 4 on mycobacterial infection.</h4><p>J.

We used immunofluorescent assay to detect whether the recombinant mBNBD4 had entered the macrophages. The antimycobacterial activity of mBNBD4 was tested through colony-forming unit (cfu) assay. Morphological changes in the cell wall of M. bovis treated with mBNBD4 were observed by scanning electron microscope.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> mBNBD4 was expressed and successfully purified from P. pastoris with intact antimicrobial activity. The recombinant protein was able to enter Raw 264.7 macrophages and exhibited potent in vitro bactericidal activity against M. smegmatis and M. bovis. The cell wall of M. bovis was disrupted after interaction with mBNBD4. Exogenous addition of mBNBD4 to both Raw 264.7 and THP-1 derived macrophages reduced the intracellular survival of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis relative to control cells.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Our data show that mBNBD4 plays an important role in inhibiting mycobacterial growth and in controlling intracellular survival of mycobacteria. mBNBD4 could therefore an effective antimycobacterial molecule in combination with other measures.</p><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of a fungal sterol esterase/lipase in different hosts: Effect on solubility, glycosylation and production.</h4><p>M. E. Vaquero et al., J Biosci Bioeng   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25939548>pubmed link</a></p><p>Ophiostoma piceae secretes a versatile sterol-esterase (OPE) that shows high efficiency in both hydrolysis and synthesis of triglycerides and sterol esters. This enzyme produces aggregates in aqueous solutions, but the recombinant protein, expressed in Komagataella (synonym Pichia) pastoris, showed higher catalytic efficiency because of its higher solubility. This fact owes to a modification in the N-terminal sequence of the protein expressed in Pichia pastoris, which incorporated 4-8 additional amino acids, affecting its aggregation behavior. In this study we present a newly engineered P. pastoris strain with improved protein production. We also produced the recombinant protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the prokaryotic host Escherichia coli, corroborating that the presence of these N-terminal extra amino acids affected the protein's solubility. The OPE produced in the new P. pastoris strain presented the same physicochemical properties than the old one. An inactive form of the enzyme was produced by the bacterium, but the recombinant esterase from both yeasts was active even after its enzymatic deglycosylation, suggesting that the presence of N-linked carbohydrates in the mature protein is not essential for enzyme activity. Although the yield in S. cerevisiae was lower than that obtained in P. pastoris, this work demonstrates the importance of the choice of the heterologous host for successful production of soluble and active recombinant protein. In addition, S. cerevisiae constitutes a good engineering platform for improving the properties of this biocatalyst.</p><hr><h4>Expression optimization and biochemical properties of two glycosyl hydrolase family 3 beta-glucosidases.</h4><p>Y.

Methanol concentration and pH significantly affected the production. The combined effects of the two factors were optimized by using the response surface method, resulting in a 137% and 84% increase in rTrBGL1 and rSfBGL1 yield compared to single-factor experiment. Structure and biochemical properties of the two enzyme were investigated and compared. They belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 3 and exhibit significant hydrolysis activity and low-level transglycosylation activity. The two enzymes show similar substrate affinity and ion-tolerance, and both of them can be activated by Cr(6+), Mn(2+) and Fe(2+). The rSfBGL1 has greater catalytic speed, higher specific activity and acid-tolerance than rTrBGL1, but rTrBGL1 is more thermostable and has higher optimal temperature than rSfBGL1. This study provides a useful and quick optimal method for recombinant enzyme production and makes a valuable comparison of biochemical properties, which opens important avenues of exploration for relationship between structure and function and further practical applications.</p><hr><h4>Expression of an Aspergillus niger xylanase in yeast: Application in breadmaking and in vitro digestion.</h4><p>F.

The purified enzyme showed a specific activity of 910Umg(-1) and a molecular mass of 24kDa. It had an optimal activity at pH 4 and 50 degrees C, stable in a wide range of pH and in the presence of some detergents and organic solvents. r-XAn11-His6 (recombinant xylanase) was used as an additive in breadmaking. A decrease in water absorption, an increase in dough rising and improvements in volume and specific volume of the bread were recorded. The r-XAn11-His6 was also used in in vitro digestion of barley and wheat bran leading to a decrease of the viscosities and an increase of the reducing sugars and total sugars contents.</p><hr><h4>Multistep processing of the secretion leader of the extracellular protein Epx1 in Pichia pastoris and implications on protein localization.</h4><p>S. Heiss et al., Microbiology   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934645>pubmed link</a></p><p>Secretion leaders are required to direct nascent proteins to the secretory pathway. They are of interest to study intracellular protein transport, and are required for the production of secretory recombinant proteins. Secretion leaders are processed in two steps in the ER and Golgi. Although yeast cells typically contain about 150 proteins entering the secretory pathway, only a low number is actually secreted to the cell supernatant. Analysis of the secretome of the yeast Pichia pastoris revealed that the most abundant secretory protein, which we named Epx1, belongs to the cysteine-rich secretory protein family CRISP. Surprisingly, the Epx1 secretion leader undergoes a 3-step processing on its way to the cell exterior instead of the usual 2-step processing. The Kex2 cleavage site within the P. pastoris Epx1 leader is not conserved in homologues of most other yeasts. We studied the effect of exchanging the Kex2-cleavage motif on the secretory behaviour of reporter proteins fused to variants of the Epx1 leader sequence, and determined mistargeting for some but not all of the variants using fluorescence microscopy. By targeting several recombinant human proteins for secretion we revealed that a short variant of the leader sequence as well as the Epx1 signal sequence alone resulted in correct N-termini of the secreted proteins. Both leader variants proved to be very efficient, even exceeding the secretion levels obtained with commonly used secretion leaders. Taken together, the novel Epx1 secretion leader sequences are a valuable tool for recombinant protein production as well as basic research of intracellular transport.</p><hr><h4>Codon optimization and expression of irisin in Pichia pastoris GS115.</h4><p>H.

In order to illuminate the function and therapeutic effect of irisin, gaining active irisin is necessary. In this work, a codon-optimized irisin gene was designed according to Pichia pastoris synonymous codon usage bias and cloned into the pPIC9K expression vector. Sequencing result indicating that the sequence of irisin was consistent with the modified irisin and the irisin was in frame with alpha-factor secretion signal ATG. The plasmid pPIC9K-irisin was transformed into GS115 P. pastoris cells through electroporation. The positive transformants were screened on MD medium and analyzed by PCR. Five recombinant GS115/pPIC9K-irisin strains were obtained, but only one strain expressed irisin successfully. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were used to assess the expression level and purity of irisin. The irisin was also simply purified and the effect of pH value, methanol concentration and induction time on the production of irisin was investigated. The results showed that the best conditions of irisin expression were as follows: pH 6.0, 2.0% methanol and induction for 96h. This work laid the basis for further investigation into the therapeutic and pharmacological effects of irisin, as well as development of irisin-based therapy.</p><hr><h4>A collagen-binding EGFR single-chain Fv antibody fragment for the targeted cancer therapy.</h4><p>H. Liang et al., J Control Release 209 101 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916496>pubmed link</a></p><p>Collagen, a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is highly expressed in a variety of cancers and influences the tumor microenvironment by increasing the recruitment of macrophages and endothelial cells. Therefore, collagen is a highly promising target for cancer therapy. The collagen-binding domain (CBD) can dynamically bind to collagen and achieve the sustained release of CBD-fused protein in the collagen network. Here, we developed a collagen-binding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody fragment for targeting the collagen-rich ECM in tumors. The single chain fragment variable (scFv) of cetuximab was fused to CBD (CBD-scFv) and expressed in Pichia pastoris. CBD-scFv preserved the antigen binding domain and anti-tumor activity of cetuximab in vitro. Moreover, CBD-scFv displayed a collagen binding ability due to the function of CBD. In vivo experiments revealed that CBD-scFv bound to collagen and achieved sustained release in tumors. Furthermore, CBD-scFv significantly suppressed the growth of tumors in A431 xenografts. Therefore, CBD-scFv had a potential therapeutic value for the collagen-rich carcinomas. The specific target and sustained release of CBD-scFv in tumors could be a new approach for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy.</p><hr><h4>Synergistic Action of a Metalloprotease and a Serine Protease from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici Cleaves Chitin-Binding Tomato Chitinases, Reduces Their Antifungal Activity, and Enhances Fungal Virulence.</h4><p>M. K. Jashni et al., Mol Plant Microbe Interact  MPMI04150074R (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25915453>pubmed link</a></p><p>As part of their defense strategy against fungal pathogens, plants secrete chitinases that degrade chitin, the major structural component of fungal cell walls. Some fungi are not sensitive to plant chitinases because they secrete chitin-binding effector proteins that protect their cell wall against these enzymes. However, it is not known how fungal pathogens that lack chitin-binding effectors overcome this plant defense barrier. Here, we investigated the ability of fungal tomato pathogens to cleave chitin-binding domain (CBD)-containing chitinases and its effect on fungal virulence. Four tomato CBD chitinases were produced in Pichia pastoris and were incubated with secreted proteins isolated from seven fungal tomato pathogens. Of these, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Verticillium dahliae, and Botrytis cinerea were able to cleave the extracellular tomato chitinases SlChi1 and SlChi13. Cleavage by F. oxysporum removed the CBD from the N-terminus, shown by mass spectrometry, and significantly reduced the chitinase and antifungal activity of both chitinases. Both secreted metalloprotease FoMep1 and serine protease FoSep1 were responsible for this cleavage. Double deletion mutants of FoMep1 and FoSep1 of F. oxysporum lacked chitinase cleavage activity on SlChi1 and SlChi13 and showed reduced virulence on tomato. These results demonstrate the importance of plant chitinase cleavage in fungal virulence.</p><hr><h4>The stage-specific in vitro efficacy of a malaria antigen cocktail provides valuable insights into the development of effective multi-stage vaccines.</h4><p>H. Spiegel et al., Biotechnol J   (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913888>pubmed link</a></p><p>Multicomponent vaccines targeting different stages of Plasmodium falciparum represent a promising, holistic concept towards better malaria vaccines. Additionally, an effective vaccine candidate should demonstrate cross-strain specificity because many antigens are polymorphic, which can reduce vaccine efficacy. A cocktail of recombinant fusion proteins (VAMAX-Mix) featuring three diversity-covering variants of the blood-stage antigen PfAMA1, each combined with the conserved sexual-stage antigen Pfs25 and one of the pre-erythrocytic-stage antigens PfCSP_TSR or PfCelTOS, or the additional blood-stage antigen PfMSP1_19, was produced in Pichia pastoris and used to immunize rabbits. The immune sera and purified IgG were used to perform various assays determining antigen specific titers and in vitro efficacy against different parasite stages and strains. In functional in vitro assays we observed robust inhibition of blood-stage (up to 90%), and sexual-stage parasites (up to 100%) and biased inhibition of pre-erythrocytic parasites (0-40%). Cross-strain blood-stage efficacy was observed in erythrocyte invasion assays using four different P. falciparum strains. The quantification of antigen-specific IgGs allowed the determination of specific IC50 values. The significant difference in antigen-specific IC50 requirements, the direct correlation between antigen-specific IgG and the relative quantitative representation of antigens within the cocktail, provide valuable implementations for future multi-stage, multi-component vaccine designs.</p><hr><h4>The structure-function relationship of thrombin-like enzymes from the green pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris).</h4><p>P.

Studies have shown that the hypofibrinogenemia is a consequence of snake venom thrombin-like enzymes (TLEs), the serine proteases that have the potential to be both diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Exosites of thrombin are the molecular regions that determine the substrate specificities, but its presence and significance in TLEs are unclear. Therefore, the putative exosites of recombinant TLEs derived from Green pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris), GPV-TL1 and GPV-TL2, were mutated in a Pichia pastoris system. In a previous report, GPV-TL1 showed a strong fibrinogenolytic activity on the Aalpha and Bbeta chains of fibrinogen, as well as a plasma clotting activity. Compared with GPV-TL1, the GPV-TL1m mutated in the putative exosite (TRN to RRR at residues 60-62) showed a weaker fibrinogenolytic activity with a similar clotting activity of 207.1 thrombin units/mg. GPV-TL2 contained two-residue differences from GPV-TL1 in the putative exosite (N73M and V74Y). GPV-TL2 selectively cleaved only the Aalpha chain of fibrinogen without detectable clotting activity. The mutated GPV-TL2 (GPV-TL2m) showed a weaker fibrinogenolytic activity compared with that of the wild type. These results support the important roles of the putative exosite in snake venom TLE activities. This information is helpful for future protein engineering.</p><hr><h4>A Neutral Thermostable beta-1,4-Glucanase from Humicola insolens Y1 with Potential for Applications in Various Industries.</h4><p>X.

Using barley beta-glucan as a substrate, recombinant HiCel6C protein exhibited neutral pH (6.5) and high temperature (70 degrees C) optima. Distinct from most reported acidic fungal endo-beta-1,4-glucanases, HiCel6C was alkali-tolerant, retaining greater than 98.0, 61.2, and 27.6% of peak activity at pH 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0, respectively, and exhibited good stability over a wide pH range (pH 5.0-11.0) and at temperatures up to 60 degrees C. The Km and Vmax values of HiCel6C for barley beta-glucan were 1.29 mg/mL and 752 mumol/min.mg, respectively. HiCel6C was strictly specific for the beta-1,4-glucoside linkage exhibiting activity toward barley beta-glucan, lichenan, and carboxy methylcellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na), but not toward laminarin (1,3-beta-glucan). HiCel6C cleaved the internal glycosidic linkages of cellooligosaccharides randomly and thus represents an endo-cleaving enzyme. The predominant product of polysaccharide hydrolysis by HiCel6C was cellobiose, suggesting that it functions by an endo-processive mechanism. The favorable properties of HiCel6C make it a good candidate for basic research and for applications in the textile and brewing industries.</p><hr><h4>Deletion of genes encoding fatty acid desaturases leads to alterations in stress sensitivity in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Zhang et al., FEMS Yeast Res 15 fov020 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25903382>pubmed link</a></p><p>Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) are key compounds which have important roles in maintaining cell membrane physiological functions and the adaption to tough conditions. Defects of fatty acid desaturases will change cellular UFA constitution. Pichia pastoris GS115 has four fatty acid desaturase genes, namely FAD9A, FAD9B, FAD12 and FAD15. Their products catalyze the synthesis of three kinds of UFAs, oleic acid (catalyzed by Fad9A and Fad9B), linoleic acid (catalyzed by Fad12) and alpha-linolenic acid (catalyzed by Fad15), respectively. In this study, we found that deletion of FAD12 led to increased resistance to oxidative stress. Cellular lipid peroxidation levels declined in the fad12Delta mutant upon H2O2 treatment. Cellular fatty acids compositions were changed with the increased expression of FAD9A. On the other hand, deletion of FAD9A resulted in increased tolerance to the plasma membrane (PM) damage agent SDS, and PM deformation was not detected in the fad9ADelta mutant under this stress. Our results showed that UFAs are related to cell adaption to adverse environmental changes.</p><hr><h4>Improving Performance and Operational Stability of Porcine Interferon-alpha Production by Pichia pastoris with Combinational Induction Strategy of Low Temperature and Methanol/Sorbitol Co-feeding.</h4><p>M. J. Gao et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 176 493 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875784>pubmed link</a></p><p>Various induction strategies were investigated for effective porcine interferon-alpha (pIFN-alpha) production by Pichia pastoris in a 10 L fermenter. We found that pIFN-alpha concentration could be significantly improved with the strategies of low-temperature induction or methanol/sorbitol co-feeding. On this basis, a combinational strategy of induction at lower temperature (20 degrees C) with methanol/sorbitol co-feeding has been proposed for improvement of pIFN-alpha production. The results reveal that maximal pIFN-alpha concentration and antiviral activity reach the highest level of 2.7 g/L and 1.8 x 10(7) IU/mg with the proposed induction strategy, about 1.3-2.1 folds higher than those obtained with other sub-optimal induction strategies. Metabolic analysis and online multi-variable measurement results indicate that energy metabolic enrichment is responsible for the performance enhancement of pIFN-alpha production, as a large amount of ATP could be simultaneously produced from both formaldehyde oxidation pathway in methanol metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in sorbitol metabolism. In addition, the proposed combinational induction strategy enables P. pastoris to be resistant to high methanol concentration (42 g/L), which conceivably occur associating with the error-prone methanol over-feeding. As a result, the proposed combinational induction strategy simultaneously increased the targeted protein concentration and operational stability leading to significant improvement of pIFN-alpha production.</p><hr><h4>Screening, cloning and expression analysis of a cellulase derived from the causative agent of hypertrophy sorosis scleroteniosis, Ciboria shiraiana.</h4><p>R. Lu et al., Gene 565 221 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865297>pubmed link</a></p><p>A cellulase gene (KJ700939, CsCelA) from Ciboria shiraiana that is highly expressed during the infection of mulberry fruit was screened by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Using cDNA isolated from infected mulberry fruits as template, the full-length 1170-bp sequence of CsCelA was obtained, which encodes a 390-amino acid protein with a putative signal peptide of 24 amino acids. The 998-bp fragment encoding the mature peptide of CsCelA was cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pPIC9K vector and overexpressed as an active protein of 55.3kDa in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The specific activity of induced supernatants of the recombinant cellulase (CsCelA) was 17.44U/ml and 135U/g for freeze-dried powder. The Kmax and Vmax of CsCelA for sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were 4.6mg/ml and 107.2U/mg, respectively. The supernatant and freeze-dried powder of the recombinant cellulase exhibited stable activity from pH4.0 to 9.0, and at temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 55 degrees C. Finally, the activity of the recombinant cellulase was assessed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the cell walls of mulberry leaves. CsCelA showed an endo-cellulase mode of cleavage, as assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC).</p><hr><h4>C4-dicarboxylic acid production by overexpressing the reductive TCA pathway.</h4><p>T.

Three expression cassettes which carried the pyruvate carboxylase gene (pc), the cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase gene (mdh1) and the retargeted fumarase gene (Tfum) were integrated into the chromosomal DNA of P. pastoris GS115 alone or jointly. Multicopy integrations were screened using quantitative PCR for C4-dicarboxylic acid overaccumulation. The results showed that the highest titer in 96 h of fumaric, malic and succinic acid (0.76, 42.28 and 9.42 g l(-1)) was obtained by co-expression of pc and mdh1 in P. pastoris. This is the first report about multiple genes engineered in P. pastoris for C4-dicarboxylic acid production. The strain Pp-PC-MDH1, moreover, has a significant potential to produce malic acid in aerobic conditions.</p><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of camel chymosin in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>N. Wang et al., Protein Expr Purif 111 75 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25837439>pubmed link</a></p><p>Chymosin efficiently coagulates milk and so is widely used in commercial cheese production. Traditional chymosin production requires the slaughter of a large numbers of unweaned calves. In the present study, a full-length camel prochymosin gene was synthesized and cloned into the pPIC9K vector, which was then inserted into the yeast strain, Pichia pastoris GS115. Expression of the chymosin gene in yeast was under the control of an AOX1 inducible promoter. The yeast system produced approximately 37mg/L of recombinant enzyme under lab conditions. SDS-PAGE of the raw supernatant revealed two molecular bands, which were approximately 42kDa and 45kDa in size. The 45kDa band disappeared after treatment of the supernatant with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), indicating that the recombinant protein was partially glycosylated. When subjected to a low pH, recombinant prochymosin was converted into mature and active chymosin. The active chymosin was capable of specifically hydrolyzing kappa-casein. A pH of 5.04, and temperature range of 45-50 degrees C, was optimum for milk clotting activity. Maximum milk clotting activity was detected with the inclusion of 20-40mM CaCl2. The recombinant enzyme was highly active and stable over a wide pH range (from 2.5 to 6.5) at 20 degrees C for 8h. Thermostability of the recombinant enzyme was also analyzed. Pilot-scale production (300mg/L) was attained using a 5L fermenter. We demonstrated that expression of the camel chymosin gene in P. pastoris could represent an excellent system for producing active camel chymosin for potential use in the commercial production of cheese.</p><hr><h4>A novel laccase from basidiomycete Cerrena sp.: Cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization.</h4><p>J.

The 1554-bp cDNA of Lac1 encoded a mature protein with 497 amino acids, preceded by a signal peptide of 20 amino acids. An unconventional intron splice site and incomplete splicing variants of Lac1 were observed. Lac1 was heterologously expressed in the yeast host Pichia pastoris, and a maximal laccase activity of 6.3UmL(-1) in the fermentation broth was achieved after fermentation for 9 days. The recombinant protein rLac1 was purified, and its enzymatic properties and functional characteristics were investigated. When ABTS was used as the substrate, the enzyme was most active at pH 3.5 and 55 degrees C, and stable at pH 4-10 and 20-60 degrees C. The Km and kcat values of rLac1 toward ABTS were 28.9 muM and 332.4s(-1), respectively. Furthermore, rLac1 was tolerant to common metal ions up to 100mM concentration and capable of decolorizing structurally different dyes in the absence of a redox mediator. Hence, Lac1 may be useful for industrial applications, such as dye decolorization and bioremediation.</p><hr><h4>High-yield production of recombinant virus-like particles of enterovirus 71 in Pichia pastoris and their protective efficacy against oral viral challenge in mice.</h4><p>C. Zhang et al., Vaccine 33 2335 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25820068>pubmed link</a></p><p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative pathogens of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which is highly prevalent in the Asia-Pacific regions. Severe HFMD cases with neurological complications and even death are often associated with EV71 infections. However, no licensed EV71 vaccine is currently available. Recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) of EV71 have been produced and shown to be a promising vaccine candidate in preclinical studies. However, the performance of current recombinant expression systems for EV71 VLP production remains unsatisfactory with regard to VLP yield and manufacturing procedure, and thus hinders further product development. In this study, we evaluated the expression of EV71 VLPs in Pichia pastoris and determined their protective efficacy in mouse models of EV71 infections. We showed that EV71 VLPs could be produced at high levels up to 4.9% of total soluble protein in transgenic P. pastoris yeast co-expressing P1 and 3CD proteins of EV71. The resulting yeast-produced VLPs potently induced neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous EV71 strains in mice. More importantly, maternal immunization with VLPs protected neonatal mice in both intraperitoneal and oral challenge experiments. Collectively, these results demonstrated the success of simple, high-yield production of EV71 VLPs in transgenic P. pastoris, thus lifting the major roadblock in commercial development of VLP-based EV71 vaccines.</p><hr><h4>Directed evolution of a beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from Bacillus subtilis MA139 for improving thermal stability and other characteristics.</h4><p>H. Pei et al., J Basic Microbiol 55 869 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25808979>pubmed link</a></p><p>In order to improve some characteristics of a beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from Bacillus subtilis MA139, directed evolution was conducted in this study. After error-prone PCR, the beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene, glu-opt, was cloned into the vector pBGP1 and transformed into Pichia pastoris X-33 to construct a mutant library. Three variants named as 7-32, 7-87, and 7-115 were screened from 8000 colonies. Amino-acid sequence analysis showed that these mutants had one or two amino-acid substitutions (7-32: T113S, 7-87: M44V/N53H, and 7-115: N157D). The variants were over-expressed in P. pastoris by methanol induction. After purification of the enzyme proteins, the characteristics of the variants were analyzed in detail. It indicated that these mutant enzymes had broader ranges of pH value and better pH stability than the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme 7-87 had the best ability to tolerate an acid environment (pH 2.0), while the wild-type enzyme had no activity under this condition. Moreover, all these mutants demonstrated improved thermal stability. In particular, the mutant enzyme 7-32 had residual enzymatic activity of 60% and 40% after being incubated at 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C for 10 min. While, the wild-type enzyme had no residual enzymatic activity after being incubated at 80 degrees C for 4 min. In addition, the mutant enzymes had better tolerance to some chemicals than the wild-type enzyme. The improved stability could enhance the prospects for this enzyme to have use in the feed industry to reduce the effects of the anti-nutritional factor beta-glucan.</p><hr><h4>Expression of Bioactive Callithrix jacchus Follicle-Stimulating Hormone in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

Marmoset-specific follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation is required to improve superovulation protocols and to develop homologous FSH monitoring assays in these monkeys. In this study, we document the large-scale expression of recombinant marmoset FSH in methylotropic yeast, Pichia pastoris. The recombinant preparation was found to be immunologically active in Western blotting and radioimmunoassay. The preparation displayed receptor binding ability in radioreceptor assay. Based on the receptor binding ability, the yield of fermentation was estimated to be 7.2 mg/L. FSH-induced cAMP assay and estradiol assay revealed that the recombinant hormone is able to induce signal transduction. Both immunological and in vitro biological activity of marmoset FSH was found to be comparable to purified human pituitary FSH, which served as reference hormone for these assays. Thus, the study suggests that a Pichia expression system can be used for large-scale expression of bioactive recombinant marmoset FSH.</p><hr><h4>The purification and characterization of ATP synthase complexes from the mitochondria of four fungal species.</h4><p>S. Liu et al., Biochem J 468 167 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759169>pubmed link</a></p><p>The ATP synthases have been isolated by affinity chromatography from the mitochondria of the fungal species Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia pastoris, Pichia angusta and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The subunit compositions of the purified enzyme complexes depended on the detergent used to solubilize and purify the complex, and the presence or absence of exogenous phospholipids. All four enzymes purified in the presence of n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside had a complete complement of core subunits involved directly in the synthesis of ATP, but they were deficient to different extents in their supernumerary membrane subunits. In contrast, the enzymes from P. angusta and S. cerevisiae purified in the presence of n-decyl-beta-maltose neopentyl glycol and the phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] had a complete complement of core subunits and also contained all of the known supernumerary membrane subunits, e, f, g, j, k and ATP8 (or Aap1), plus an additional new membrane component named subunit l, related in sequence to subunit k. The catalytic domain of the enzyme from P. angusta was more resistant to thermal denaturation than the enzyme from S. cerevisiae, but less stable than the catalytic domain of the bovine enzyme, but the stator and the integrity of the transmembrane proton pathway were most stable in the enzyme from P. angusta. The P. angusta enzyme provides a suitable source of enzyme for studying the structure of the membrane domain and properties associated with that sector of the enzyme complex.</p><hr><h4>Preparation of an engineered safer immunotoxin against colon carcinoma based on the ribotoxin hirsutellin A.</h4><p>J. Tome-Amat et al., FEBS J 282 2131 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752204>pubmed link</a></p><p>Immunotoxins are chimeric proteins composed of an antibody domain that specifically directs the action of the toxic domain, resulting in the death of the targeted cells. Over recent years, immunotoxins have been widely studied and the number of different constructions has increased exponentially. Protein engineering has allowed the design of optimized versions of immunotoxins with an improved tumor binding affinity, stability or cytotoxic efficacy, although sometimes this has compromised the safety of the patient in terms of undesirable adverse secondary reactions. A triple mutant at three Trp residues (HtA3DeltaW) of the ribotoxin hirsutellin A retains its specific ribonucleolytic activity, although cell internalization capacity is lacking. This toxin variant has been fused to the single chain variable fragment A33 (scFvA33). This immunoconjugate (IMTXA33HtA3DeltaW) was produced in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Both target and toxic domains were characterized. The immunotoxin showed an exquisite specific binding against GPA33-positive culture cells, which results in the death of the targeted cells because of specific ribonucleolytic activity against ribosomes of the engineered hirsutellin A variant. IMTXA33HtA3DeltaW represents a promising structure in the search for an improved immunotoxin without compromising the safety of patients.</p><hr><h4>Functional expression and molecular characterization of Culex quinquefasciatus salivary alpha-glucosidase (MalI).</h4><p>R. Suthangkornkul et al., Protein Expr Purif 110 145 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746591>pubmed link</a></p><p>Salivary alpha-glucosidases (MalI) have been much less characterized when compared with midgut alpha-glucosidases, which have been studied in depth. Few studies have been reported on the partial characterization of MalI, but no clear function has been ascribed. The aim of this study is to purify and characterize the recombinant Culex quinquefasciatus (CQ) alpha-glucosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris. The cDNA encoding mature Cx. quinquefasciatus alpha-glucosidase gene with polyhistidine tag (rCQMalIHis) was successfully cloned into the expression vector, pPICZalphaB, designated as pPICZalphaB/CQMalIHis. The activity of recombinant rCQMalIHis expressed in P. pastoris could be detected at 3.75U/ml, under optimal culture conditions. The purified rCQMalIHis showed a single band of molecular weight of approximately 92kDa on SDS-PAGE. After Endoglycosidase H digestion, a single band at 69kDa was found on SDS-PAGE analysis, suggesting that rCQMalIHis is a glycoprotein. Additionally, tryptic digestion and LC-MALDI MS/MS analysis suggested that the 69kDa band corresponds to the Cx. quinquefasciatus alpha-glucosidase. Thus, rCQMalIHis is a glycoprotein. The rCQMalIHis exhibited optimum pH and temperature at 5.5 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the purified rCQMalIHis for maltotriose is higher than those for sucrose, maltotetraose, maltose and p-nitrophenyl-alpha-glucoside, indicating that the enzyme prefers maltotriose. Additionally, the rCQMalIHis is significantly inhibited by d-gluconic acid delta-lactone, but not by Mg(2+), Ca(2+) and EDTA. The rCQMalIHis is strongly inhibited by acarbose with IC50 67.8+/-5.6nM, but weakly inhibited by glucose with IC50 115.9+/-7.3mM.</p><hr><h4>Effect of dilution rate and methanol-glycerol mixed feeding on heterologous Rhizopus oryzae lipase production with Pichia pastoris Mut(+) phenotype in continuous culture.</h4><p>C.

Berrios, Biotechnol Prog 31 707 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25740724>pubmed link</a></p><p>The induction using substrate mixtures is an operational strategy for improving the productivity of heterologous protein production with Pichia pastoris. Glycerol as a cosubstrate allows for growth at a higher specific growth rate, but also has been reported to be repressor of the expression from the AOX1 promoter. Thus, further insights about the effects of glycerol are required for designing the induction stage with mixed substrates. The production of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was used as a model system to investigate the application of methanol-glycerol feeding mixtures in fast metabolizing methanol phenotype. Cultures were performed in a simple chemostat system and the response surface methodology was used for the evaluation of both dilution rate and methanol-glycerol feeding composition as experimental factors. Our results indicate that productivity and yield of ROL are strongly affected by dilution rate, with no interaction effect between the involved factors. Productivity showed the highest value around 0.04-0.06 h(-1) , while ROL yield decreased along the whole dilution rate range evaluated (0.03-0.1 h(-1) ). Compared to production level achieved with methanol-only feeding, the highest specific productivity was similar in mixed feeding (0.9 UA g-biomass(-1) h(-1) ), but volumetric productivity was 70% higher. Kinetic analysis showed that these results are explained by the effects of dilution rate on specific methanol uptake rate, instead of a repressor effect caused by glycerol feeding. It is concluded that despite the effect of dilution rate on ROL yield, mixed feeding strategy is a proper process option to be applied to P. pastoris Mut(+) phenotype for heterologous protein production.

Mature relaxin family peptides are typically composed of two polypeptide chains with three disulfide linkages, rendering their preparation a challenging task. In the present study, we established an efficient approach for preparation of the chimeric relaxin family peptide R3/I5 through secretory overexpression in Pichia pastoris and in vitro enzymatic maturation. A designed single-chain R3/I5 precursor containing the B-chain of human relaxin-3 and the A-chain of human INSL5 was overexpressed in PichiaPink strain 1 by high-density fermentation in a two-liter fermenter, and approximately 200 mg of purified precursor was obtained from one liter of the fermentation supernatant. We also developed an economical approach for preparation of the uniformly (15)N-labeled R3/I5 precursor by culturing in shaking flasks, and approximately 15 mg of purified (15)N-labeled precursor was obtained from one liter of the culture supernatant. After purification by cation ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, the R3/I5 precursor was converted to the mature two-chain form by sequential treatment with endoproteinase Lys-C and carboxypeptidase B. The mature R3/I5 peptide had an alpha-helix-dominated conformation and retained full receptor-binding and receptor activation activities. Thus, Pichia overexpression was an efficient approach for sample preparation and isotopic labeling of the chimeric R3/I5 peptide. This approach could also be extended to the preparation of other relaxin family peptides in future studies.</p><hr><h4>Economic analysis of royalactin production under uncertainty: Evaluating the effect of parameter optimization.</h4><p>M.

Titchener-Hooker, Biotechnol Prog 31 744 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25737309>pubmed link</a></p><p>Royalactin is a protein with several different potential uses in humans. Research, in insects and in mammalian cells, has shown that it can accelerate cell division and prevent apoptosis. The method of action is through the use of the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is present in humans. Potential use in humans could be to lower cholesterolemic levels in blood, and to elicit similar effects to those seen in bees, e.g., increased lifespan. Mass production of Royalactin has not been accomplished, though a recent article presented a Pichia pastoris fermentation and recovery by aqueous two-phase systems at laboratory scale as a possible basis for production. Economic modelling is a useful tool with which compare possible outcomes for the production of such a molecule and in particular, to locate areas where additional research is needed and optimization may be required. This study uses the BioSolve software to perform an economic analysis on the scale-up of the putative process for Royalactin. The key parameters affecting the cost of production were located via a sensitivity analysis and then evaluated by Monte Carlo analysis. Results show that if titer is not optimized the strategy to maintain a low cost of goods is process oriented. After optimization of this parameter the strategy changes to a product-oriented and the target output becomes the critical parameter determining the cost of goods. This study serves to provide a framework for the evaluation of strategies for future production of Royalactin, by analyzing the factors that influence its cost of manufacture.

The parasite must overcome immune response and microbiota to develop inside the midgut of triatomines. In this study, we expressed, purified and characterized a Kazal-type inhibitor from the midgut of R. prolixus, named RpTI, which may be involved in microbiota - T. cruzi interactions. The qPCR showed that the RpTI transcript was primarily expressed in tissues from the intestinal tract and that it was upregulated in the anterior midgut after T. cruzi infection. A 315-bp cDNA fragment encoding the mature protein was cloned into the pPIC9 vector and expressed in Pichia pastoris system. Recombinant RpTI (rRpTI) was purified on a trypsin-Sepharose column and had a molecular mass of 11.5 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. This protein inhibited trypsin (Ki = 0.42 nM), whereas serine proteases from the coagulation cascade were not inhibited. Moreover, trypanocidal assays revealed that rRpTI did not interfere in the viability of T. cruzi trypomastigotes. The RpTI transcript was also knocked down by RNA interference prior to infection of R. prolixus with T. cruzi. The amount of T. cruzi in the anterior midgut was significantly lower in RpTI knockdown insects compared to the non-silenced groups. We also verified that the bacterial load is higher in the anterior midgut of silenced and infected R. prolixus compared to non-silenced and infected insects. Our results suggest that T. cruzi infection increases the expression of RpTI to mediate microbiota modulation and is important for parasite immediately after infection with R. prolixus.</p><hr><h4>High-level expression of a novel alpha-galactosidase gene from Rhizomucor miehei in Pichia pastoris and characterization of the recombinant enyzme.</h4><p>Z.

In this study, a novel NADPH-dependent xylose reductase gene from R. oryzae AS 3.819 (Roxr) was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Homology alignment suggested that the 320-residue protein contained domains and active sites belonging to the aldo/keto reductase family. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the recombinant xylose reductase has a molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. The optimal catalytic pH and temperature of the purified recombinant protein were 5.8 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The recombinant protein was stable from pH 4.4 to 6.5 and at temperatures below 42 degrees C. The recombinant enzyme has bias for D-xylose and L-arabinose as substrates and NADPH as its coenzyme. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR tests suggested that native Roxr expression is regulated by a carbon catabolite repression mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis at two possible key sites involved in coenzyme binding, Thr(226) --> Glu(226) and Val(274) --> Asn(274) , were performed, respectively. The coenzyme specificity constants of the resulted RoXR(T226E) and RoXR(V274N) for NADH increased 18.2-fold and 2.4-fold, which suggested possibility to improve the NADH preference of this enzyme through genetic modification.

Here we describe the cloning, extracellular expression and characterization of a novel non-blue laccase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme was secreted into the culture supernatant with high activity. It lacks the absorption band at 610 nm typical for blue laccases. However, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum proved the existence of type 1 copper center that was not detectable in the UV-visible spectrum. Metal content analysis revealed that the enzyme contains two copper ions, one iron ion and one zinc ion per protein molecular, suggesting that it is a novel non-blue laccase. The pH and temperature optima of the recombinant laccase were 6.6 and 60 degrees C, respectively, and it was stable at pH 9.0 for 10 days. The enzyme activity was slightly activated by NaCl with concentration up to 200 mM. The purified laccase showed high efficiency in decolorizing reactive black 5 and indigo carmine, achieving more than 93% decolorization after 1h. The extreme robustness of the recombinant B. amyloliquefaciens laccase offers several advantages over most fungal laccases in various industrial applications.</p><hr><h4>LvDJ-1 plays an important role in resistance against Vibrio alginolyticus in Litopenaeus vannamei.</h4><p>M.

Wang, Fish Shellfish Immunol 44 180 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25703712>pubmed link</a></p><p>DJ-1 was first identified as an oncogene that transformed mouse NIH3T3 cells in cooperation with activated Ras. It has since exhibited a variety of functions in a range of organisms. In this study, the DJ-1 gene in Litopenaeus vannamei (LvDJ-1) was identified and characterized. A recombinant protein LvDJ-1 was produced in Pichia pastoris. LvDJ-1 expression in vivo was knocked down by dsRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi), which led to significantly decreased levels of LvDJ-1 mRNA and protein. When the L. vannamei were challenged with RNAi and Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcription and expression of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (LvCZSOD) in the hepatopancreas were dramatically lower in shrimp with knocked down LvDJ-1 than in controls. Transcription and expression of P53 (LvP53) were significantly higher in shrimp lacking LvDJ-1 than in controls. Hepatopancreas samples were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Moreover, blood samples from the shrimp, assessed with flow cytometry, showed significant increases in respiratory burst and apoptosis in those lacking LvDJ-1 compared to the controls. Cumulative mortality in the shrimp lacking LvDJ-1 was significantly different from that in the control group after challenge with V. alginolyticus. Altogether, the results prove that LvDJ-1 regulates apoptosis and antioxidant activity, and that these functions play an important role in L. vannamei resistance against V. alginolyticus.</p><hr><h4>Comparison of the purification of biologically active IL-7 cytokine expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Paul, Protein Expr Purif 110 65 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25703052>pubmed link</a></p><p>The large scale screening of cytokine mutants is a component of binding and activity mapping and requires an efficient method of cytokine protein expression. Here, we compared recombinant IL-7 expression with and purification from Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. The IL-7 cytokine contains three disulfide bonds that are essential for its biological activity, and which are formed upon secretion through P. pastoris, but not in the reducing cytoplasm of E. coli. In contrast to a previous report we found that P. pastoris secretes active but N-linked hyperglycosylated IL-7. Enzymatic deglycosylation was incompatible with activity measurements in a cell based assay. E. coli expressed IL-7 was refolded from solubilized inclusion bodies. A chromatographic purification step between inclusion body solubilization and refolding increased the yield of biologically active monomeric IL-7, and decreased the amount of inactive soluble aggregates. Cation exchange chromatography of untagged IL-7, and IMAC of His-tagged IL-7 improved refolding yields to a similar extend, indicating that the removal of contaminating components in the solubilized inclusion bodies improves refolding efficiency. We conclude that a chromatographic purification step of IL-7 solubilized from E. coli inclusion bodies increases refolding yield, and may be a suitable general rescue strategy for obtaining folded and biologically active proteins from inclusion bodies.</p><hr><h4>Expression of enzymes for the usage in food and feed industry with Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

This yeast can be grown to very high cell densities and produces high titers of recombinant protein, which can be expressed intercellularly or be secreted to the fermentation medium. P. pastoris offers some advantages over other established expression systems especially in protein maturation. In food and feed production many enzymatically catalyzed processes are reported and the demand for new enzymes grows continuously. For instance the unique catalytic properties of enzymes are used to improve resource efficiency, maintain quality, functionalize food, and to prevent off-flavors.

Lualdi et al., Mol Biotechnol 57 513 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25663099>pubmed link</a></p><p>Ribonucleases form a large family of enzymes involved in RNA metabolism and are endowed with a broad range of biological functions. Among the different RNase proteins described in the last decades, those belonging to the Rh/T2/S subfamily show the highest degree of evolutionary conservation, suggesting the occurrence of a key critical ancestral role for this protein family. We have recently defined the human RNASET2 gene as a novel member of a group of oncosuppressors called "tumor antagonizing genes," whose activity in the control of cancer growth is carried out mainly in vivo. However, to better define the molecular pathways underlying the oncosuppressive properties of this protein, further structural and functional investigations are necessary, and availability of high-quality recombinant RNASET2 is of paramount importance. Here, we describe a multi-step strategy that allows production of highly pure, catalytically competent recombinant RNASET2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. The recombinant proteins that were produced with our purification strategy will be instrumental to perform a wide range of functional assays aimed at dissecting the molecular mechanisms of RNASET2-mediated tumor suppression.</p><hr><h4>Recombinant production and evaluation of an antibacterial L-amino acid oxidase derived from flounder Platichthys stellatus.</h4><p>K. Kasai et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 99 6693 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25661816>pubmed link</a></p><p>Fish produce mucus substances as a defensive outer barrier against several bacterial infections. We have recently identified an antibacterial L-amino acid oxidase (psLAAO1) in the mucus layer of the flounder Platichthys stellate. In this study, the antibacterial protein psLAAO1 was expressed as a secretory bioactive recombinant protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant psLAAO1 inhibited the growth of bacteria to the same levels as native psLAAO1 present in mucus. In particular, Staphylococci and Yersinia were strongly suppressed, showing the highest growth retardation of the 21 species and strains tested. Moreover, Staphylococcus epidermidis was most sensitive to psLAAO1 with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.078 mug/mL, whereas Escherichia coli was essentially resistant to psLAAO1 with a MIC of >10 mug/mL. Interestingly, psLAAO1-treated E. coli were found to upregulate the expression of the btuE gene, which encodes glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The biochemical function of GPx is to reduce free hydrogen peroxide and is induced under response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, E. coli confers resistance to the reduced free hydrogen peroxide produced by psLAAO1 by increasing GPx levels. Furthermore, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus was completely inhibited in the presence of recombinant psLAAO1. The morphology of psLAAO1-treated S. aureus showed cell surface damage, the formation of large aggregates and the cells showed severe deformations. Western blot analysis showed that psLAAO1 binds to the surface of S. aureus. Therefore, psLAAO1 binds to the surface of LAAO-sensitive S. aureus and directs peroxidative activity at the surface of the bacterial membrane.</p><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris as an expression host for membrane protein structural biology.</h4><p>B.

P. pastoris combines the advantages of ease of use, relatively rapid expression times and low cost with eukaryotic co-translational and post-translational processing systems and lipid composition. The suitability of P. pastoris for high density controlled culture in bioreactors means large amounts of protein can be obtained from small culture volumes. This review details the key features of P. pastoris, which have made it a particularly useful system for the production of membrane proteins, including receptors, channels and transporters, for structural studies. In addition, this review provides an overview of all the constructs and cell strains used to produce membrane proteins, which have yielded high resolution structures.</p><hr><h4>Molecular cloning, expression and purification of lactoferrin from Tibetan sheep mammary gland using a yeast expression system.</h4><p>J.

The recombinant lactoferrin was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange column chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography, and it had a molecular mass of 76kDa. We obtained an expression yield of >60mgL(-1) and specific activity of 2533.33Umg(-1). The antimicrobial activities and iron-binding behaviors of recombinant lactoferrin indicated that it was correctly folded and functional. Additionally, recombinant lactoferrin inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli JM109 and Staphylococcus aureus. These findings indicate that recombinant lactoferrin is a potential antibiotic for use on humans. This study also demonstrates the successful expression of recombinant lactoferrin using the eukaryotic host organism P. pastoris, paving the way for protein engineering using this gene.</p><hr><h4>Optimal conditions for expressing a complement component 3b functional fragment (alpha2-macroglobulin receptor) gene from Epinephelus coioides in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>G.

In order to characterize the domain thoroughly larger than currently available quantities are required. Thus, in this study the Epinephelus coioides alpha2MR (Ec-alpha2MR) was expressed and secreted by the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris with variations in pH and induction time to identify optimal production conditions. At pH 5.5 with 48h induction 13mg of Ec-alpha2MR (ca. 90% purity) was obtained from 500ml of culture. The Ec-alpha2MR protein product was validated by MALDI-TOF MS sequence analysis, and both Western blotting and ELISAs demonstrated that it possessed the expected activity, binding to C3b or C3b homolog antibodies, and thus can be used for future studies of the interactions and functions of complement proteins in teleosts.</p><hr><h4>Phase analysis in single-chain variable fragment production by recombinant Pichia pastoris based on proteomics combined with multivariate statistics.</h4><p>Y.

The time courses of the fed-batch culture were separated into three distinct phases: the growth phase of the batch process, the growth phase of the fed-batch process, and the production phase of the fed-batch process. Multivariate statistical analysis using 2-DE gel image analysis data clearly showed the change in the culture phase and provided information concerning the protein expression, which suggested a metabolic change related to cell growth and production during the fed-batch culture. Furthermore, specific proteins, such as alcohol oxidase, which is strongly related to scFv expression, and proteinase A, which could biodegrade scFv in the latter phases of production, were identified via the PMF method. The proteomics technique provided valuable information about the effect of the methanol concentration on scFv production.</p><hr><h4>In vitro and in vivo characterization of a new recombinant antimicrobial peptide, MP1102, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</h4><p>Y. Zhang et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 99 6255 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25620367>pubmed link</a></p><p>Currently, more antimicrobial drug candidates are urgently needed to combat the rise in drug-resistance among pathogenic microbes. A new antimicrobial peptide, MP1102, a variant of NZ2114, was designed, evaluated, and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. The total secreted protein in cultures reached 695 mg/l, and the concentration of the recombinant MP1102 (rMP1102) was 292 mg/l. rMP1102 was purified from the fermentation supernatant by one-step cation exchange chromatography to obtain a yield of 197.1 mg/l with 96.4 % purity. rMP1102 exhibited potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for four Staphyloccocus aureus (S. aureus) strains ranged from 0.028 to 0.11 muM, and it had stronger activity (MIC = 0.04 to 0.23 muM) to 20 clinical isolates of MRSA (cMRSA) than rNZ2114 (MIC = 0.11 to 0.90 muM). rMP1102 was shown to kill over 99.9 % of tested S. aureus cells within 6 h when treated at one, two, and four times its MIC and over 90 % of S. aureus cells within 12 h at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg in a mouse thigh infection model. The higher sensitivity of MRSA to MP1102 than to its parental peptide, NZ2114, indicated by this initial pharmacodynamic analysis suggests a possible difference in the killing mechanism of these two molecules. rMP1102 caused less than 0.05 % hemolytic activity at 128 mug/ml and exhibited good thermostability from 20 to 80 degrees C, with its highest activity being observed at pH 8.0. These results suggest that this yeast expression system is feasible for large-scale production, and rMP1102 exerted stronger activity against S. aureus than NZ2114 via a different mechanism and exhibited potential as a new antimicrobial agent for S. aureus, especially MRSA infections.</p><hr><h4>Gene Cloning, High-Level Expression, and Characterization of an Alkaline and Thermostable Lipase from Trichosporon coremiiforme V3.</h4><p>J.

The lipase gene without its signal sequence was cloned into plasmid pPICZalphaA and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris X33. The maximum lipase activity of recombinant lipase was 5,000 U/ml, which was obtained in fed-batch cultivation after 168 h induction with methanol in a 50 L bioreactor. The purified lipase showed high temperature tolerance, and being stable at 60 degrees C and kept 45% enzyme activity after 1 h incubation at 70 degrees C. The stability, effects of metal ions and other reagents were also determined. The chain length specificity of the recombinant lipase showed high activity toward triolein (C18:1) and tripalmitin (C16:0).</p><hr><h4>Tannase sequence from a xerophilic Aspergillus niger Strain and production of the enzyme in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J.

In this work, we describe the gene and amino acid sequences of the tannase from Aspergillus niger GH1. In addition, we engineered Pichia pastoris strains to produce and secrete the enzyme, and the produced tannase was characterized biochemically. The nucleotide sequence of mature tannase had a length of 1,686 bp, and encodes a protein of 562 amino acids. A molecular model of mature A. niger GH1 tannase showed the presence of two structural domains, one with an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and one lid domain that covers the catalytic site, likely being residues Ser-196, Asp-448, and His-494 the putative catalytic triad, which are connected by a disulfide bond between the neighboring cysteines, Cys-195 and Cys-495. A 120-ml shake flask culture with a constructed recombinant P. pastoris strain showed extracellular tannase activity at 48 h induction of 0.57 U/ml. The produced tannase was N-glycosylated, consisted of two subunits, likely linked by a disulfide bond, and had an optimum pH of 5.0 and optimum temperature of 20 degrees C. These biochemical properties differed from those of native A. niger GH1 tannase. The recombinant tannase could be suitable for food and beverage applications.</p><hr><h4>Production of recombinant human growth hormone conjugated with a transcytotic peptide in Pichia pastoris for effective oral protein delivery.</h4><p>J.

However, the low bioavailability of a protein drug in the intestine due to the physical barriers of the intestinal epithelia is the most critical problem that needs to be solved. To overcome the low bioavailability of a protein drug in the intestine, we aimed to construct a recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing a human growth hormone (hGH) fusion protein conjugated with a transcytotic peptide (TP) that was screened through peroral phage display to target goblet cells in the intestinal epithelia. The TP-conjugated hGH was successfully produced in P. pastoris in a secreted form at concentrations of up to 0.79 g/l. The function of the TP-conjugated hGH was validated by in vitro and in vivo assays. The transcytotic function of the TP through the intestinal epithelia was verified only in the C terminus conjugated hGH, which demonstrated the induction of IGF-1 in a HepG2 cell culture assay, a higher translocation of recombinant hGH into the ileal villi after oral administration in rats and both IGF-1 induction and higher body weight gain in rats after oral administration. The present study introduces the possibility for the development of an effective oral protein delivery system in the pharmaceutical and animal industries through the introduction of an effective TP into hGH.</p><hr><h4>A macrokinetic model-based comparative meta-analysis of recombinant protein production by Pichia pastoris under AOX1 promoter.</h4><p>J.

Mean specific rates and state variables for various fed-batch cultures, under methanol limited and non-limited conditions were used for modeling. The most representative kinetic functions (viz., Monod, Haldane, Pirt and Luedeking-Piret) were used for the specific rates of cell growth (micro), substrate consumption (qS ) and product formation (qP ). The performance of two different process models was assessed via simulation tests, using an overall validation procedure. The best model describes the cellular growth by a non-monotonic substrate function, substrate uptake via Pirt's equation and product formation through a Luedeking-Piret equation. A comparative meta-analysis of heterologous protein production of various target proteins by Pichia pastoris under AOX1 promoter was conducted and a general strategy for improving protein production from process kinetics was developed as a key to bioprocess optimization.</p><hr><h4>Codon optimization of xylA gene for recombinant glucose isomerase production in Pichia pastoris and fed-batch feeding strategies to fine-tune bioreactor performance.</h4><p>O.

Codons of xylA gene from T. thermophilus were optimized, ca. 30 % of the codons were replaced with those with higher frequencies according to the codon usage bias of P. pastoris, codon optimization resulted in a 2.4-fold higher rGI activity. To fine-tune bioreactor performance, fed-batch bioreactor feeding strategies were designed as continuous exponential methanol feeding with pre-calculated feeding rate based on the pre-determined specific growth rate, and fed-batch methanol-stat feeding. Six feeding strategies were designed, as follows: (S1) continuous exponential methanol- and pulse- sorbitol feeding; (S2) continuous exponential methanol- and peptone- feeding; (S3) continuous exponential methanol- and pulse- mannitol feeding; (S4) continuous exponential methanol- and peptone- feeding and pulse-mannitol feeding; (S5) methanol-stat feeding by keeping methanol concentration at 5 g L(-1); and, (S6) methanol-stat feeding by keeping methanol concentration at 5 g L(-1) and pulse-mannitol feeding. The highest cell and rGI activity was attained as 117 g L(-1) at t = 66 h and 32530 U L(-1) at t = 53 h, in strategy-S5. The use of the co-substrate mannitol does not increase the rGI activity in methanol-stat feeding, where 4.1-fold lower rGI activity was obtained in strategy-S6. The overall cell yield on total substrate was determined at t = 53 h as 0.21 g g(-1) in S5 strategy.</p><hr><h4>Thermostability enhancement of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from Talaromyces stipitatus by site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>D.

Such high-temperature processing requires development of thermostable enzymes. Talaromyces stipitatus was found to secrete endo-1,4-beta-galactanase when grown on sugar beet pectin as sole carbon source. The mature protein contained 353 AA and the MW was estimated to 36.5 kDa. It was subjected to codon optimization and produced in Pichia pastoris in 2 l scale yielding 5.3 g. The optimal reaction condition for the endo-1,4-beta-galactanase was determined to be 46 degrees C at pH 4.5 at which the specific activity was estimated to be 6.93 mumol/min/mg enzyme with half-lives of 13 and 2 min at 55 and 60 degrees C, respectively. For enhancement of the half-life of TSGAL, nine single amino acid residues were selected for site-directed mutagenesis on the basis of semi-rational design. Of these nine mutants, G305A showed half-lives of 114 min at 55 degrees C and 15 min at 60 degrees C, respectively. This is 8.6-fold higher than that of the TSGAL at 55 degrees C, whereas the other mutants displayed moderate positive to negative changes in their half-lives.</p><hr><h4>Secretion and assembly of calicivirus-like particles in high-cell-density yeast fermentations: strategies based on a recombinant non-specific BPTI-Kunitz-type protease inhibitor.</h4><p>E.

Recently, intracellular high-level expression of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) capsid protein (VP1) as a self-assembled multipurpose antigen/carrier was established as a production process from P. pastoris. Since recovery of VP1 from the culture media implies technological and economic advantages, the secretion of VP1 variants was undertaken in this work. Conversely, extensive degradation of VP1 was detected. Variations to culture parameters and supplementation with different classes of additives were unable to diminish degradation. Strategies were then conducted during fermentations using a recombinant variant of a non-specific BPTI-Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (rShPI-1A) isolated from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus. The presence of the inhibitor in the culture medium at the recombinant protein induction phase, as well as co-culture of the yeast strains expressing VP1 and rShPI-1A, led to VP1 protection from proteolysis and to production of ordered virus-like particles. A yeast strain was also engineered to co-express the rShPI-1A inhibitor and intact VP1. Expression levels up to 116 mg L(-1) of VP1 were reached under these approaches. The antigen was characterized and purified in a single chromatography step, its immunogenic capacity was evaluated, and a detection test for specific antibodies was developed. This work provides feasible strategies for improvements in P. pastoris heterologous protein secretion and is the first report on co-expression of the ShPI-1A with a recombinant product otherwise subjected to proteolytic degradation.</p><hr><h4>A practical approach for O-linked mannose removal: the use of recombinant lysosomal mannosidase.</h4><p>D.

Hamilton, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 99 3913 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381909>pubmed link</a></p><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is an attractive expression system due to its ability to secrete large amounts of recombinant protein, with the potential for glycosylation. Advances in glycoengineering of P. pastoris have successfully demonstrated the humanization of both the N- and O-linked glycosylation pathways in this organism. However, in certain cases, the presence of O-linked glycans on a therapeutic protein may not be desirable. Recently, we have reported the in vitro utility of jack bean alpha-1,2/3/6-mannosidase to remove O-linked mannose from intact undenatured glycoproteins produced in glycoengineered P. pastoris. However, one caveat of this strategy is that jack bean mannosidase has yet to be cloned and as such is only available as crude cellular extracts. This raises several concerns for using this reagent to treat large preparations of therapeutic proteins generated in P. pastoris. Therefore, we postulated that lysosomal mannosidases which have been cloned and demonstrated to have similar activities to jack bean mannosidase on N-linked glycans would also process O-linked glycans in a similar fashion. To this end, we screened a panel of recombinant lysosomal mannosidases from different organisms and identified several which cannot only reduce extended O-linked mannose chains but which can also hydrolyze the Man-alpha-O-Ser/Thr glycosidic bond on intact glycoproteins. As such, not only do we show for the first time the utility of lysosomal mannosidase for O-linked mannose processing, but since this is a recombinant enzyme, it has several benefits over the use of crude jack bean mannosidase extracts.</p><hr><h4>High-level extracellular expression of inulin fructotransferase in Pichia pastoris for DFA III production.</h4><p>R. Zhan et al., J Sci Food Agric 95 1408 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25257988>pubmed link</a></p><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Inulin fructotransferase (IFTase) catalyzes inulin conversion to difructose anhydride (DFA III), which is a natural low-calorie sweetener. Although heterologous expression of IFTase was achieved in Escherichia coli, the extracellular enzyme activity was very low, which limited the commercialization of IFTase.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Active IFTase of about 43 kDa molecular mass of subunit was extracellularly expressed by Pichia pastoris and was greatly regulated by the IFTase gene copy number integrated into the P. pastoris genome and by the methanol concentration in the induction phase. Under optimized culture conditions, multicopy P. pastoris exhibited a maximum extracellular IFTase activity of 105.4 U mL(-1) in a 5 L fermenter, which was 8.9-fold the activity in shake flasks and 5.3-fold that obtained from wild-type strain.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> IFTase was expressed in a eukaryotic P. pastoris system for the first time and achieved high-level extracellular expression using a high-cell-density fed-batch cultivation strategy. This demonstrated that P. pastoris was a good candidate for potential DFA III production as a novel IFTase expression system.</p><hr><h4>High-level secretory expression and purification of unhydroxylated human collagen alpha1(III) chain in Pichia pastoris GS115.</h4><p>L. Li et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem 62 467 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231012>pubmed link</a></p><p>Recombinant collagen and gelatin have been applied in biomedical materials field because of products from genetically engineered microorganisms with improved safety, traceability, reproducibility, and homogeneous quality. To obtain high-level secretory expression of single-chain full-length human collagen alpha1(III) chain (COL3A1) without the N and C telopeptides, the cDNA coding for the human COL3A1 gene was cloned into the secretory expression vector pPIC9K and integrated into Pichia pastoris GS115. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis of culture supernatant from the recombinant methylotrophic yeast suggested that the unhydroxylated recombinant human COL3A1 (rhCOL3A1) was secreted into the culture medium, and exhibited an apparent molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa, which is 1.4 times higher than the theoretical one. Finally, the unhydroxylated rhCOL3A1 was purified to greater than 90% purity using a four-step approach. In addition, methylthiazolydiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide experiments indicated that low concentration of rhCOL3A1 could promote Baby hamster kidney cell (BHK21) proliferation effectively. The production and purification of rhCOL3A1 described in this study offer a new method for obtaining high level of rhCOL3A1 in relatively pure form, which is suitable for biomedical materials application.</p><hr><h4>New strategy for expression of recombinant hydroxylated human collagen alpha1(III) chains in Pichia pastoris GS115.</h4><p>J. He et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem 62 293 (2015).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953863>pubmed link</a></p><p>Type III collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the human body, which forms collagen fibrils and provides the stiff, resilient characteristics of many tissues. In this paper, a new method for secretory expression of recombinant hydroxylated human collagen alpha1(III) chain in Pichia pastoris GS115 was applied. The gene encoding for full-length human collagen alpha1(III) chain (COL3A1) without N-terminal propeptide and C-terminal propeptide was cloned in the pPIC9K expression vector. The prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H, EC 1.14.11.2) alpha-subunit (P4Halpha) and beta-subunit (P4Hbeta) genes were cloned in the same expression vector, pPICZB. Fluorogenic quantitative PCR indicates that COL3A1 and P4H genes have been expressed in mRNA level. SDS-PAGE shows that secretory expression of recombinant human collagen alpha1(III) chain was successfully achieved in P. pastoris GS115. In addition, the result of amino acids composition analysis shows that the recombinant human collagen alpha1(III) chain contains hydroxyproline by coexpression with the P4H. Furthermore, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates that proline residues of the recombinant human collagen alpha1(III) chain were hydroxylated in the X or Y positions of Gly-X-Y triplets.</p>
