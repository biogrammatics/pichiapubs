Clones of P. pastoris with multiple gene copies have been generated by multiple transformations and post-transformational vector amplification, which led to 10.7-fold enhancement in alpha-amylase titre as compared to a clone with a copy of the gene. The recombinant P. pastoris integrated eight copies of Ba-Gt-amy in the genome of P. pastoris, as revealed by real time PCR data analysis. Heterologous protein expression as well as mRNA level of Ba-Gt-amy was higher in multi-copy clone than that with single copy. The pure Ba-Gt-amy expressed in P. pastoris is a glycoprotein of 75 kDa, which is optimally active at pH 4.0 and 60 degrees C with T1/2 of 40 min at 70 degrees C. The Kinetic parameters and end product analysis suggested that glycosylation has no effect on catalytic properties of Ba-Gt-amy. The enzyme saccharifies soluble as well as raw starches efficiently and generates maltose and maltooligosaccharides, thus, useful in baking and sugar syrup industries. The strategy for generating multi-copy clones is being reported for the first time, which could be useful in enhancing the production of other recombinant proteins.</p></details><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris versus Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a case study on the recombinant production of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.</h4><p>A. M. Tran et al., BMC Res Notes 10 148 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376863>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) is a glycoprotein that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of neutropenia and leukemia in combination with chemotherapies. Recombinant hGM-CSF is produced industrially using the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by large-scale fermentation. The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, has emerged as an alternative host cell system due to its shorter and less immunogenic glycosylation pattern together with higher cell density growth and higher secreted protein yield than S. cerevisiae. In this study, we compared the pipeline from gene to recombinant protein in these two yeasts.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Codon optimization in silico for both yeast species showed no difference in frequent codon usage. However, rhGM-CSF expressed from S. cerevisiae BY4742 showed a significant discrepancy in molecular weight from those of P. pastoris X33. Analysis showed purified rhGM-CSF species with molecular weights ranging from 30 to more than 60 kDa. Fed-batch fermentation over 72 h showed that rhGM-CSF was more highly secreted from P. pastoris than S. cerevisiae (285 and 64 mg total secreted protein/L, respectively). Ion exchange chromatography gave higher purity and recovery than hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified rhGM-CSF from P. pastoris was 327 times more potent than rhGM-CSF from S. cerevisiae in terms of proliferative stimulating capacity on the hGM-CSF-dependent cell line, TF-1.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Our data support a view that the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris is an effective recombinant host for heterologous rhGM-CSF production.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancement of recombinant BmK AngM1 production in Pichia pastoris by regulating gene dosage, co-expressing with chaperones and fermenting in fed-batch mode.</h4><p>Q.

The heterologous expression of BmK AngM1 was achieved in Pichia pastoris in our previous study. In order to realize high-level expression of recombinant BmK AngM1 (rBmK AngM1), the gene dosage of BmK AngM1 was optimized in engineered strains. The yield of rBmK AngM1 in the four-copy strain reached up to 100 mg/L, which was further enhanced to 190 mg/L by co-expressing with chaperones of PDI, BiP, and HAC1. Moreover, the yield of rBmK AngM1 was up to 1200 mg/L by high-density fermentation in 10 L fermenter. Finally, 360 mg rBmK AngM1 was purified from 1 L cultures by a two-step purification method. The efficient and convenient techniques presented in this study could facilitate further scale-up for industrial production of rBmK AngM1.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and Expression of a Chitinase Gene from Eisenia fetida.</h4><p>M.

In this study, we identified a chitinase gene, named Eisenia fetida-Chitinase (EF-Chi) gene, of 1494 base pairs (bp) that encodes a protein of 498 amino acids as indicated by the corresponding mRNA sequence. The amino acid sequence of EF-Chi was similar to those of chitinases from Eisenia andrei (99%), Branchiostoma floridae (50%) and Oryzias latipes (49%), and a gene encoding mature EF-Chi was expressed in the GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of the purified recombinant EF-Chi (rEF-Chi) was estimated to be 60kDa and catalytically important residues of chitinases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18 were conserved in EF-Chi. The optimal catalytic temperature of rEF-Chi was identified as 60 degrees C, and the hydrolytic product from colloidal chitin was N-acetyl-chitobiose, suggesting that EF-Chi is an exo-type enzyme.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a new laccase from Moniliophthora roreri at high levels in Pichia pastoris and its potential application in micropollutant degradation.</h4><p>A.

Urlacher, AMB Express 7 73 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357784>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Laccases have gained significant attention due to their emerging applications including bioremediation, biomass degradation and biofuel cells. One of the prerequisites for the industrial application of laccases is their sufficient availability. However, expression levels of recombinantly expressed laccases are often low. In this study Mrl2, a new laccase from the basidiomycete Moniliophthora roreri, was cloned in Pichia pastoris and produced in an optimized fed-batch process at an exceptionally high yield of 1.05 g l-1. With a redox potential of 0.58 V, Mrl2 belongs to mid-redox potential laccases. However, Mrl2 demonstrated high kcat values of 316, 20, 74, and 36 s-1 towards 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), syringaldazine (SGZ), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP) and guaiacol, respectively. Mrl2 remained stable above pH 6 and in the presence of many metal ions, which is important for application in bioremediation. Mrl2 was investigated for the ability to degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSDAIs) at neutral pH value. The enzyme accepted and converted estrone, 17beta-estradiol, estriol, the synthetic contraceptive 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and bisphenol A at pH 7 faster than high-potential laccases from Trametes versicolor. For example, within 30 min Mrl2 removed more than 90% bisphenol A, 17ss-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and estriol, respectively. The concentration of the recalcitrant drug diclofenac dropped by 56% after 20 h incubation with Mrl2.</p></details><hr><h4>Effects of UPR and ERAD pathway on the prolyl endopeptidase production in Pichia pastoris by controlling of nitrogen source.</h4><p>X.

Pichia pastoris has been used for the PEP production; however, the fermentation process has not be investigated and little is known about the impact of excessive PEP production on the host cell physiology. Here, we optimized the nitrogen source to improve the PEP expression level and further evaluated the cellular response including UPR and ERAD. During methanol induction phase the PEP activity (1583 U/L) was increased by 1.48-fold under the optimized nitrogen concentration of NH4+ (300 mmol/L) and casamino acids [1.0% (w/v)] in a 3-L bioreactor. Evaluated by RT-PCR the UPR and ERAD pathways were confirmed to be activated. Furthermore, a strong decrease of ERAD-related gene transcription was observed with the addition of nitrogen source, which contributed to a higher PEP expression level.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression, purification and characterization of three novel esterases secreted by the lignocellulolytic fungus Penicillium purpurogenum when grown on sugar beet pulp.</h4><p>G.

Culture supernatants of P. purpurogenum grown on sugar beet pulp were partially purified and the fractions obtained analyzed for esterase activity by zymograms. The bands with activity on methyl umbelliferyl acetate were subjected to mass spectrometry to identify peptides. The peptides obtained were probed against the proteins deduced from the genome sequence of P. purpurogenum. Eight putative esterases thus identified were chosen for future work. Their cDNAs were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The supernatants of the recombinant clones were assayed for esterase activity, and five of the proteins were active against one or more substrates: methyl umbelliferyl acetate, indoxyl acetate, methyl esterified pectin and fluorescein diacetate. Three of those enzymes were purified, further characterized and subjected to a BLAST search. Based on their amino acid sequence and properties, they were identified as follows: RAE1, pectin acetyl esterase (CAZy family CE 12); FAEA, feruloyl esterase (could not be assigned to a CAZy family) and EAN, acetyl esterase (former CAZy family CE 10).</p></details><hr><h4>Expressing anti-HIV VRC01 antibody using the murine IgG1 secretion signal in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Aw, P. F. McKay, R. J. Shattock, K. M. Polizzi, AMB Express 7 70 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342171>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The use of the recombinant expression platform Pichia pastoris to produce pharmaceutically important proteins has been investigated over the past 30 years. Compared to mammalian cultures, expression in P. pastoris is cheaper and faster, potentially leading to decreased costs and process development times. Product yields depend on a number of factors including the secretion signal chosen for expression, which can influence the host cell response to recombinant protein production. VRC01, a broadly neutralising anti-HIV antibody, was expressed in P. pastoris, using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter for both the heavy and light chains. Titre reached up to 3.05 mug mL-1 in small scale expression. VRC01 was expressed using both the alpha-mating factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the murine IgG1 signal peptide. Surprisingly, using the murine IgG1 signal peptide resulted in higher yield of antibody capable of binding gp140 antigen. Furthermore, we evaluated levels of secretory stress compared to the untransformed wild-type strain and show a reduced level of secretory stress in the murine IgG1 signal peptide strains versus those containing the alpha-MF signal peptide. As bottlenecks in the secretory pathway are often the limiting factor in protein secretion, reduced levels of secretory stress and the higher yield of functional antibody suggest the murine IgG1 signal peptide may lead to better protein folding and secretion. This work indicates the possibilities for utilising the murine IgG1 signal peptide for a range of antibodies, resulting in high yields and reduced cellular stress.</p></details><hr><h4>Generation, characterization and immunogenicity of a novel chimeric recombinant protein based on Plasmodium vivax AMA-1 and MSP119.</h4><p>M. V. Rocha et al., Vaccine   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28341111>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed malaria species and the most prevalent species of malaria in America and Asia. Vaccine development against P. vivax is considered a priority in the global program for the eradication of malaria. Earlier studies have characterized the Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA-1) ectodomain and the C-terminal region (19kDa) of the Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP-1) of P. vivax as immunodominant antigens. Based on this characterization, we designed a chimeric recombinant protein containing both merozoite immunodominant domains (PvAMA166-MSP119). The recombinant PvAMA166-MSP119 was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and used to immunize two different mouse strains (BALB/c and C57BL/6) in the presence of the Poly (</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C) as an adjuvant. Immunization with the chimeric protein induced high antibody titers against both proteins in both strains of mice as detected by ELISA. Antisera also recognized the native proteins expressed on the merozoites of mature P. vivax schizonts. Moreover, this antigen was able to induce IFN-gamma-secreting cells in C57BL/6 mice. These findings indicate that this novel yeast recombinant protein containing PvAMA166 and PvMSP119 is advantageous, because of improved antibody titers and cellular immune response. Therefore, this formulation should be further developed for pre-clinical trials in non-human primates as a potential candidate for a P. vivax vaccine.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolomics of Pichia pastoris: Impact of buffering conditions on the kinetics and nature of metabolite loss during quenching.</h4><p>M. Mattanovich et al., FEMS Yeast Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334329>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mass spectrometry based metabolomic profiling is a powerful strategy to quantify the concentrations of numerous primary metabolites in parallel. To avoid distortion of metabolite concentrations, quenching is applied to stop the cellular metabolism instantly. For yeasts, cold methanol quenching is accepted to be the most suitable method to stop metabolism, while keeping the cells intact for separation from the supernatant. During this treatment, metabolite loss may occur while the cells are suspended in the quenching solution. An experiment for measuring the time dependent loss of selected primary metabolites in differently buffered quenching solutions was conducted to study pH and salt concentration dependent effects. Molecular properties of the observed metabolites were correlated with the kinetics of loss to gain insight into the mechanisms of metabolite leakage. Size and charge related properties play a major role in controlling metabolite loss. We found evidence that interaction with the cell wall is the main determinant to retain a molecule inside the cell. Besides suggesting an improved quenching protocol to keep loss at a minimum, we could establish a more general understanding of the process of metabolite loss during quenching, which will allow to predict optimal conditions for hitherto not analysed metabolites.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcription factor Mxr1 promotes the expression of Aox1 by repressing glycerol transporter 1 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C. Zhan et al., FEMS Yeast Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334164>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), the efficient promoter of alcohol oxidase (PAox1) is induced by methanol and repressed by glycerol, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. In this study, the relationship between alcohol oxidase 1 (aox1), methanol expression regulator 1 (mxr1) and glycerol transporter 1 (gt1) was studied. By RT-PCR, it was found that the overexpression of gt1 could increase the glycerol content in cells and repress the expression of mxr1 and aox1, and the deletion of gt1 reduced the glycerol content in cells and promoted the expression of aox1 .The overexpression of mxr1 could repress the expression of gt1, and the deletion of mxr1 could promote the expression of gt1 to some extent. By EMSA, Mxr1 binding sites were found in the promoter of gt1 (PGt1.) (-141 to -138, CCCC), and Mxr1 could regulate the expression of gt1 by binding to PGt1. The relationships among aox1, mxr1 and gt1 revealed here to provide a reference for the understanding of the mechanism of glycerol repression of PAox1.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of maize chitinase-A, a tough allergenic molecule.</h4><p>M.

They are caused by specific proteins called food allergens. Proteins commonly identified as food allergens tend to have one of about 30 different biochemical activities. This leads to the assumption that food allergens must have specific structural features which causes their allergenicity. But these structural features are not completely understood. Uncovering the structural basis of allergenicity would allow improved diagnosis and therapy of allergies and would provide insights for safer food production. The availability of recombinant food allergens can accelerate their structural analysis, and benefit specific studies in allergology. Plant chitinases are an example of food allergenic proteins for which structural analysis of allergenicity has only partially been reported.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> The recombinant maize chitinase, rChiA, was purified from Pichia pastoris extracellular medium by differential precipitation and cation exchange chromatography. Enzyme activity was evaluated by halo-assays and microcalorimetric procedures. rChiA modeling was performed by a two-step procedure, using the Swissmodel server and Modeller software. Allergenicity of rChiA was verified by immunoblot assays with sera from allergic subjects.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> rChiA is active in the hydrolysis of glycol chitin and N-acetylchitotetraose, and maintains its activity at high temperatures (70 degrees C) and low pH (pH 3). The molecule is also reactive with IgE from sera of maize allergic subjects.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> rChiA is a valuable molecule for further studies on structure-allergenicity relationships and as a tool for diagnosing allergies.

Papala et al., Protein Expr Purif 134 25 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323169>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>CapG is an actin-binding protein, which is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, i.e. breast, ovarian, pancreatic and lung carcinoma. We successfully expressed human CapG in the wild type strain X-33 of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), which does not express endogenous CapG, in order to characterize this protein in more detail. After mechanical cell lysis, debris was centrifuged and the soluble protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. This protein pellet was dialyzed and used for CapG purification. Ca2+-dependent exposure of hydrophobic sites allowed single step and selective elution from a Phenyl Sepharose matrix. 3.5 mg CapG/10 g wet biomass were isolated and showed a Ca2+-sensitive and dose-dependent capping activity of actin in a fluorometric assay. In P. pastoris, CapG is located at actin patches, actin cables and arranges along the budding neck. The proliferation rate and morphology of the yeast cells are not influenced by the interaction of CapG with actin. The modification pattern of human CapG from P. pastoris and human carcinoma cells is highly similar. We validated most of the known post-translational modifications and found three new phosphorylation and nine new acetylation sites by mass spectrometry. The N-terminus is acetylated or truncated. Truncated CapG is not phosphorylated at the residues S10, T212 and S337. First mutagenesis experiments indicate an N-terminal acetylation dependent C-terminal phosphorylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient extracellular expression of transpeptidase sortase A in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

Among different constructed recombinant strains, the SMD1168 strain integrated 5.7 copies of srtA gene under control of AOX1 promoter was proved to be the best strain for the extracellular SrtA expression. After the optimization of fermentation conditions (induction 72 h at 28 degrees C, initial pH 6.0, supplemented with 1.5% methanol), the highest yield and activity of extracellular SrtA reached 97.8 mg/L and 131.9 U/mL at the shake-flask level, respectively. This is the first report on the efficient secretory expression of SrtA in P. pastoris and the yield of SrtA is the maximum compared with previous reports. In addition, the transpeptidation activity of extracellular SrtA was confirmed by the successful immobilization of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) onto Gly3-polystyrene beads.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Allergens Production in Yeast.</h4><p>M.

However, there is still an unmet need to further develop novel therapeutic drugs for the treatment of the refractory/relapsing human CD19+ tumors. We have developed a diphtheria toxin-based anti-human CD19 immunotoxin for targeting human CD19+ tumors. We have constructed three isoforms of the CD19 immunotoxin: monovalent, bivalent, and foldback diabody. In vitro binding affinity and efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform had the highest binding affinity and in vitro efficacy. The in vivo efficacy of the CD19 immunotoxins was assessed using human CD19+ JeKo-1 tumor-bearing NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor gamma-/- (NSG) mouse model. In these animals, CD19 immunotoxins significantly prolonged the median survival from 31 days in controls to 34, 36, and 40 days in animals receiving the monovalent isoform, foldback diabody isoform, and bivalent isoform, respectively. The bivalent CD19 immunotoxin is a promising therapeutic drug candidate for targeting relapsing/refractory human CD19+ tumors.</p></details><hr><h4>Implications of evolutionary engineering for growth and recombinant protein production in methanol-based growth media in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J.

Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has been applied in a wide range of studies in order to improve strains for biotechnological purposes. In this context, the impact of long-term carbon source adaptation in P. pastoris has not been addressed so far. Thus, we performed a pilot experiment in order to analyze the applicability and potential benefits of ALE towards improved growth and recombinant protein production in P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Adaptation towards growth on methanol was performed in replicate cultures in rich and minimal growth medium for 250 generations. Increased growth rates on these growth media were observed at the population and single clone level. Evolved populations showed various degrees of growth advantages and trade-offs in non-evolutionary growth conditions. Genome resequencing revealed a wide variety of potential genetic targets associated with improved growth performance on methanol-based growth media. Alcohol oxidase represented a mutational hotspot since four out of seven evolved P. pastoris clones harbored mutations in this gene, resulting in decreased Aox activity, despite increased growth rates. Selected clones displayed strain-dependent variations for AOX-promoter based recombinant protein expression yield. One particularly interesting clone showed increased product titers ranging from a 2.5-fold increase in shake flask batch culture to a 1.8-fold increase during fed batch cultivation.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our data indicate a complex correlation of carbon source, growth context and recombinant protein production. While similar experiments have already shown their potential in other biotechnological areas where microbes were evolutionary engineered for improved stress resistance and growth, the current dataset encourages the analysis of the potential of ALE for improved protein production in P. pastoris on a broader scale.</p></details><hr><h4>Corrigendum: High-level expression of improved thermo-stable alkaline xylanase variant in Pichia Pastoris through codon optimization, multiple gene insertion and high-density fermentation.</h4><p>Y.

For this reason, yeast is often considered a preferable expression system. Here, we describe the manipulation and secretory expression of human meprin beta in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. We show that the position of the affinity tag strongly influences the yield of expression, favoring fusion of the affinity tag at the C-terminus.</p></details><hr><h4>Preparation of VSV-G viral envelope glycoprotein from Pichia pastoris enhances transfection of DNA into animal cells.</h4><p>X.

The objective of this study was to establish a potential approach for large scale production of VSV-G. To this end, VSV-G was cloned with a N-terminal His-tag into Pichia pastoris expression vector pPIC3.5K. Three clones (Muts) containing the VSV-G expression cassette were identified by PCR. All clones proliferated normally in expansion medium, while the proliferation was reduced significantly under induction conditions. VSV-G protein was detected in cell lysates by Western Blot, and the highest expression level was observed at 96 h post induction. VSV-G could also be obtained from the condition medium of yeast protoplasts. Further, VSV-G could be incorporated into Ad293 cells and was able to induce cell fusion, leading to the transfer of cytoplasmic protein. Finally, VSV-G mediated DNA transfection was assayed by flow cytometry and luciferase measurement. Incubation of VSV-G lysate with pGL3-control DNA complex increased luciferase activity in Ad293 and HeLa cells by about 3-fold. Likewise, incubation of VSV-G lysate with pCMV-DsRed DNA complex improved transfection efficiency into Ad293 by 10% and HeLa cells by about 1-fold. In conclusions, these results demonstrated that VSV-G could be produced from Pichia pastoris with bio-functionalities, demonstrating large scale production of the viral glycoprotein is feasible.</p></details><hr><h4>Increased dosage of AOX1 promoter-regulated expression cassettes leads to transcription attenuation of the methanol metabolism in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>E. Camara et al., Sci Rep 7 44302 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28295011>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methanol-regulated alcohol oxidase promoter (PAOX1) of Pichia pastoris is one of the strongest promoters for heterologous gene expression in this methylotrophic yeast. Although increasing gene dosage is one of the most common strategies to increase recombinant protein productivities, the increase of gene dosage of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) in P. pastoris has been previously shown to reduce cell growth, lipase production and substrate consumption in high-copy strains. To better assess that physiological response, transcriptomics analysis was performed of a subset of strains with 1 to 15 ROL copies. The macroscopic physiological parameters confirm that growth yield and carbon uptake rate are gene dosage dependent, and were supported by the transcriptomic data, showing the impact of increased dosage of AOX1 promoter-regulated expression cassettes on P. pastoris physiology under steady methanolic growth conditions. Remarkably, increased number of cassettes led to transcription attenuation of the methanol metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis in P. pastoris, concomitant with reduced secretion levels of the heterologous product. Moreover, our data also point to a block in ROL mRNA translation in the higher ROL-copies constructs, while the low productivities of multi-copy strains under steady growth conditions do not appear to be directly related to UPR and ERAD induction.</p></details><hr><h4>CFP10: mFcgamma2 as a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate increases immune response in mouse.</h4><p>A.

Baghani et al., Iran J Basic Med Sci 20 122 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293387>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> Despite treatment with antibiotics and vaccination with BCG, tuberculosis (TB) is still considered as one of the most important public health problems in the world. Therefore, designing and producing a more effective vaccine against TB seems urgently. In this study, immunogenicity of a fusion protein which consisting or comprising CFP-10 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the Fc-domain of mouse IgG2a was evaluated as a novel subunit vaccine candidate against TB.</p><p><strong> MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> The genetic constructs were cloned in pPICZalphaA expression vector and recombinant vectors (pPICZalphaA-CFP-10: Fcgamma2a and pPICZalphaA-CFP-10:His) were transformed into Pichia pastoris. To evaluate the expression of recombinant proteins, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were used. The immunogenicity of recombinant proteins, with and without BCG were assessed in BALB/c mice and specific cytokines against recombinant proteins (IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-beta) were evaluated.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in mice that received recombinant proteins was higher than the control groups (BCG and PBS). Thus, both recombinant proteins (CFP-10:Fcgamma2a and CFP-10:His) could excite good response in Th1-cells. The Fc-tagged protein had a stronger Th1 response with low levels of IL-4, as compared to CFP-10:His. However, the highest level of Th1 response was observed in groups that were vaccinated with BCG (prime) and then received recombinant protein CFP-10: Fcgamma2a (booster).</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The results demonstrated that binding mice Fc-domain to CFP-10 protein can increase the immunogenicity of the subunit vaccine. Further studies, might be able to design and produce a new generation of subunit vaccines based on the Fc-fused immunogen.</p></details><hr><h4>Expanding the feruloyl esterase gene family of Aspergillus niger by characterization of a feruloyl esterase, FaeC.</h4><p>A. Dilokpimol et al., N Biotechnol 37 200 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285179>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A feruloyl esterase (FAE) from Aspergillus niger N402, FaeC was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris X-33 in a yield of 10mg/L. FaeC was most active at pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, and showed broad substrate specificity and catalyzed the hydrolysis of methyl 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate, ethyl ferulate, methyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, ethyl coumarate, methyl sinapate, and methyl caffeate. The enzyme released both ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from wheat arabinoxylan and sugar beet pectin (up to 3mg/g polysaccharide), and acted synergistically with a commercial xylanase increasing the release of ferulic acid up to six-fold. The expression of faeC increased over time in the presence of feruloylated polysaccharides. Cinnamic, syringic, caffeic, vanillic and ferulic acid induced the expression of faeC. Overall expression of faeC was very low in all tested conditions, compared to two other A. niger FAE encoding genes, faeA and faeB. Our data showed that the fae genes responded differently towards the feruloylated polysaccharides and tested monomeric phenolic compounds suggesting that the corresponding FAE isoenzymes may target different substrates in a complementary manner. This may increase the efficiency of the degradation of diverse plant biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular identification and functional analysis of CTRP9 in Epinephelus coioides.</h4><p>G. Yang et al., J Mol Endocrinol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283578>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>CTRP9 is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) superfamily and has been studied in mammals, while the comparative studies of CTRP9 in non-mammalian species are still absent. In this study, CTRP9 was isolated and characterized from the orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The full length cDNA of CTRP9 was 1378 bp in size with ORF (open reading frame) of 1020 bp which encods a 339 amino acids preprohormone. The mRNA expression of CTRP9 showed a rather high level in the kidney and brain, but low level in other tissues. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of CTRP9 decreased significantly in the liver after fasting for 7 days, and restored to the normal levels after refeeding. In contrast, the CTRP9 mRNA level increased in the hypothalamus after fasting. The recombinant gCTRP9 (globular CTRP9) was prepared using the Pichia pastoris expression system and verified by Western blot as well as mass spectrometry assays. In the primary hepatocytes culture, the recombinant gCTRP9 could inhibit the glucose production after 12 h treatment. After i.p. (intraperitoneal) injection with recombinant gCTRP9, in hypothalamus, mRNA expression levels of NPY and orexin (orexigenic factors) decreased, while the expression levels of CRH and POMC (anorexigenic factors) increased. Moreover, i.p injection with the recombinant gCTRP9 could reduce the serum concentrations of glucose, TG and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol but increase the content of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Our studies for the first time unveil the structure of CTRP9 and its potential role as a regulatory factor of metabolism and food intake in teleost.</p></details><hr><h4>Potential of Pichia pastoris for the production of industrial penicillin G acylase.</h4><p>H. Maresova et al., Folia Microbiol (Praha)   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281229>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study deals with the potential of Pichia pastoris X-33 for the production of penicillin G acylase (PGAA) from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824. Synthetic gene matching the codon usage of P. pastoris was designed for intracellular and secretion-based production strategies and cloned into vectors pPICZ and pPICZalpha under the control of AOX1 promoter. The simple method was developed to screen Pichia transformants with the intracellularly produced enzyme. The positive correlation between acylase production and pga gene dosage for both expression systems was demonstrated in small scale experiments. In fed-batch bioreactor cultures of X-33/PENS2, an extracellular expression system, total PGAA expressed from five copies reached 14,880 U/L of an active enzyme after 142 h; however, 60% of this amount retained in the cytosol. The maximum PGAA production of 31,000 U/L was achieved intracellularly from nine integrated gene copies of X-33/PINS2 after 90 h under methanol induction. The results indicate that in both expression systems the production level of PGAA is similar but there is a limitation in secretion efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Single amino acid substitutions in the selectivity filter render NbXIP1;1alpha aquaporin water permeable.</h4><p>H. Ampah-Korsah et al., BMC Plant Biol 17 61 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279171>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane proteins that facilitate transport of water and/or other small neutral solutes across membranes in all forms of life. The X Intrinsic Proteins (XIPs) are the most recently recognized and the least characterized aquaporin subfamily in higher plants. XIP1s have been shown to be impermeable to water but permeable to boric acid, glycerol, hydrogen peroxide and urea. However, uncertainty regarding the determinants for selectivity and lack of an activity that is easy to quantify have hindered functional investigations. In an effort to resolve these issues, we set out to introduce water permeability in Nicotiana benthamiana XIP1;1alpha (NbXIP1;1alpha), by exchanging amino acid residues of predicted alternative aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filters of NbXIP1;1alpha for residues constituting the water permeable ar/R selectivity filter of AtTIP2;1.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Here, we present functional results regarding the amino acid substitutions in the putative filters as well as deletions in loops C and D of NbXIP1;1alpha. In addition, homology models were created based on the high resolution X-ray structure of AtTIP2;1 to rationalize the functional properties of wild-type and mutant NbXIP1;1alpha. Our results favour Thr 246 rather than Val 242 as the residue at the helix 5 position in the ar/R filter of NbXIP1;1alpha and indicate that the pore is not occluded by the loops when heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Moreover, our results show that a single amino acid substitution in helix 1 (L79G) or in helix 2 (I102H) is sufficient to render NbXIP1;1alpha water permeable. Most of the functional results can be rationalized from the models based on a combination of aperture and hydrophobicity of the ar/R filter.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The water permeable NbXIP1;1alpha mutants imply that the heterologously expressed proteins are correctly folded and offer means to explore the structural and functional properties of NbXIP1;1alpha. Our results support that Thr 246 is part of the ar/R filter. Furthermore, we suggest that a salt bridge to an acidic residue in helix 1, conserved among the XIPs in clade B, directs the orientation of the arginine in the ar/R selectivity filter and provides a novel approach to tune the selectivity of AQPs.</p></details><hr><h4>Complement inhibition by Sarcoptes scabiei protects Streptococcus pyogenes - An in vitro study to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the poorly understood predilection of S. pyogenes to infect mite-induced skin lesions.</h4><p>P. M. Swe et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 11 e0005437 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278252>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> On a global scale scabies is one of the most common dermatological conditions, imposing a considerable economic burden on individuals, communities and health systems. There is substantial epidemiological evidence that in tropical regions scabies is often causing pyoderma and subsequently serious illness due to invasion by opportunistic bacteria. The health burden due to complicated scabies causing cellulitis, bacteraemia and sepsis, heart and kidney diseases in resource-poor communities is extreme. Co-infections of group A streptococcus (GAS) and scabies mites is a common phenomenon in the tropics. Both pathogens produce multiple complement inhibitors to overcome the host innate defence. We investigated the relative role of classical (CP), lectin (LP) and alternative pathways (AP) towards a pyodermic GAS isolate 88/30 in the presence of a scabies mite complement inhibitor, SMSB4. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> Opsonophagocytosis assays in fresh blood showed baseline immunity towards GAS. The role of innate immunity was investigated by deposition of the first complement components of each pathway, specifically C1q, FB and MBL from normal human serum on GAS. C1q deposition was the highest followed by FB deposition while MBL deposition was undetectable, suggesting that CP and AP may be mainly activated by GAS. We confirmed this result using sera depleted of either C1q or FB, and serum deficient in MBL. Recombinant SMSB4 was produced and purified from Pichia pastoris. SMSB4 reduced the baseline immunity against GAS by decreasing the formation of CP- and AP-C3 convertases, subsequently affecting opsonisation and the release of anaphylatoxin. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Our results indicate that the complement-inhibitory function of SMSB4 promotes the survival of GAS in vitro and inferably in the microenvironment of the mite-infested skin. Understanding the tripartite interactions between host, parasite and microbial pathogens at a molecular level may serve as a basis to develop improved intervention strategies targeting scabies and associated bacterial infections.</p></details><hr><h4>Structure of SALO, a leishmaniasis vaccine candidate from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis.</h4><p>O. A.

Because of the importance of SALO as a potential component of a leishmaniasis vaccine, a plan to produce this recombinant protein for future scale manufacturing as well as knowledge of its structural characteristics are needed to move SALO forward for the clinical path. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> Recombinant SALO was expressed as a soluble secreted protein using Pichia pastoris, rSALO(P), with yields of 1g/L and >99% purity as assessed by SEC-MALS and SDS-PAGE. Unlike its native counterpart, rSALO(P) does not inhibit the classical pathway of complement; however, antibodies to rSALO(P) inhibit the anti-complement activity of sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Immunization with rSALO(P) produces a delayed type hypersensitivity response in C57BL/6 mice, suggesting rSALO(P) lacked anti-complement activity but retained its immunogenicity. The structure of rSALO(P) was solved by S-SAD at Cu-Kalpha to 1.94 A and refined to Rfactor 17%. SALO is ~80% helical, has no appreciable structural similarities to any human protein, and has limited structural similarity in the C-terminus to members of insect odorant binding proteins. SALO has three predicted human CD4+ T cell epitopes on surface exposed helices. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> The results indicate that SALO as expressed and purified from P. pastoris is suitable for further scale-up, manufacturing, and testing. SALO has a novel structure, is not similar to any human proteins, is immunogenic in rodents, and does not have the anti-complement activity observed in the native salivary protein which are all important attributes to move this vaccine candidate forward to the clinical path.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioactivity studies of Huh-7 cells derived human epidermal growth factor expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

The presented work is a detailed report regarding molecular characterization of Huh-7 cells-derived hEGF expressed in Pichia pastoris with special reference to its glycosylation profiling and bioactivity studies. Densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE separated extracellular proteins from hEGF recombinant Pichia pastoris strain indicated that about 84% of the extracellular proteins were glycosylated. Size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75 prep grade column was successfully utilized to separate fractions containing glycosylated and non-glycosylated extracellular proteins. In dot blot assay, hEGF was detected in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions. Bioactivity assays revealed that both glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions were bioactive as determined by cell viability assay. It was also observed that hEGF present in non-glycosylated fraction was relatively more bioactive than hEGF present in glycosylated fraction.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative Analysis of Recombinant Cytochrome P450 CYP9A61 from Cydia pomonella Expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

In this study, recombinant CYP9A61 was expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, and its biochemical properties were investigated. Substrate saturation curves and biochemical properties revealed that, in the presence of glycosylation, the yeast-secreted CYP9A61 exhibited a higher affinity for the substrate p-nitroanisole and was found to be more stable at certain pHs and temperatures than bacterially produced CYP9A61. Half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of three synthetic pyrethroids on both the bacterium- and yeast-expressed CYP9A61 suggested that recombinant CYP9A61 expressed in different hosts exhibits different inhibition properties. Taken together, our findings show that yeast-expressed CYP9A61 exhibits enzyme activity that is better than that expressed in bacteria and might be used for further metabolism assays to reveal the insecticide-detoxifying role of CYP9A61 in C. pomonella.</p></details><hr><h4>Biotransformation of menadione to its prenylated derivative MK-3 using recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Z.

Due to the relaxed aromatic substrate specificity and prenylation regiospecificity at the ortho- site of the phenolic hydroxyl group, the aromatic prenyltransferase NovQ from Streptomyces may be useful in menaquinone synthesis from menadione. In this study, NovQ was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. After fermentation optimization, NovQ production increased by 1617%. Then the different effects of metal ions, detergents and pH on the activity of purified NovQ were investigated to optimize the prenylation reaction. Finally, purified NovQ and cells containing NovQ were used for menadione prenylation in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Menaquinone-1 (MK-1) was detected as the only product in vitro with gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and menadione hydroquinol substrates. MK-3 at a concentration of 90.53 mg/L was detected as the major product of whole cell catalysis with 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and menadione hydroquinol substrates. This study realized whole cell catalysis converting menadione to menaquinones.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification of an acidic endo-polygalacturonase from Penicillium oxalicum CZ1028 and its broad use in major tropical and subtropical fruit juices production.</h4><p>Z.

A putative endo-polygalacturonase gene PoxaEnPG28A was cloned from Penicillium oxalicum CZ1028. PoxaEnPG28A consisted of a putative signal peptide and a catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 28, and it shared 72% identity with that of a functionally characterized endo-polygalacturonase from Trichoderma harzianum. Gene PoxaEnPG28A was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris with a high yield of 1828.7 U/mL. The purified recombinant enzyme PoxaEnPG28A hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in endo-manner releasing oligo-galacturonates. PoxaEnPG28A showed maximal activity at pH 5.5 and 55 degrees C, and was stable between pH 3.0 to 10.0 and below 45 degrees C. The kinetic constants Km and Vmax of PoxaEnPG28A were calculated as 1.57 g/L and 14,641.29 U/mg, respectively. PoxaEnPG28A significantly improved the yields of fruit juices from banana, plantain, papaya, pitaya and mango. The high production level of the recombinant enzyme PoxaEnPG28A by P. pastoris and remarkable catalytic activity of PoxaEnPG28A toward five kinds of fruit juices made the enzyme a potential application in agriculture and food industries.</p></details><hr><h4>A Modular Toolkit for Generating Pichia pastoris Secretion Libraries.</h4><p>U. Obst, T. K. Lu, V. Sieber, ACS Synth Biol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28252957>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Yeasts are powerful eukaryotic hosts for the production of recombinant proteins due to their rapid growth to high cell densities and ease of genetic modification. For large-scale industrial production, secretion of a protein offers the advantage of simple and efficient downstream purification that avoids costly cell rupture, denaturation and refolding. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffi) is a well-established expression host that has the ability to perform post-translational modifications and is generally regarded as safe (GRAS). Nevertheless, optimization of protein secretion in this host remains a challenge due to the multiple steps involved during secretion and a lack of genetic tools to tune this process. Here, we developed a toolkit of standardized regulatory elements specific for Pichia pastoris allowing the tuning of gene expression and choice of protein secretion tag. As protein secretion is a complex process, these parts are compatible with a hierarchical assembly method to enable the generation of large and diverse secretion libraries in order to explore a wide range of secretion constructs, achieve successful secretion, and better understand the regulatory factors of importance to specific proteins of interest. To assess the performance of these parts, we built and characterized the expression and secretion efficiency of 124 constructs that combined different regulatory elements with two fluorescent reporter proteins (RFP, yEGFP). Intracellular expression from our promoters was comparatively independent of whether RFP or yEGFP, and whether plasmid-based expression or genomically integrated expression, was used. In contrast, secretion efficiency significantly varied for different genes expressed using identical regulatory elements, with differences in secretion efficiency of >10-fold observed. These results highlight the importance of generating diverse secretion libraries when searching for optimal expression conditions, and demonstrate that our toolkit is a valuable asset for the creation of efficient microbial cell factories.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient Expression of an Acidic Endo-polygalacturonase from Aspergillus niger and Its Application in Juice Production.</h4><p>J.

Pga-zj5a lacking a signal peptide sequence was successfully amplified using A. niger ZJ5 cDNA as the template and was ligated into the pPIC9 vector. The resulting plasmid was transformed into competent cells of Pichia pastoris GS115 for heterologous expression. The polygalacturonase showed a maximum activity level of 10436 U/mL in the culture supernatant from a 3 L fermenter. Assays of enzymatic properties showed that the optimal pH and temperature of the recombinant PGA-ZJ5A were 4.5 and 40 degrees C, respectively. PGA-ZJ5A was effective in pear juice clarification, increased the volume of pear juice by 41.8%, and improved its light transmittance 3-fold.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular and catalytic properties of fungal extracellular cellobiose dehydrogenase produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems.</h4><p>S.

The CDH produced by T. reesei was most similar to the CDH originally isolated from the fungus C. thermophilus in regard to glycosylation, cofactor loading and catalytic constants. Under the tested experimental conditions the fungal expression hosts produce CDH of superior quality and uniformity compared to P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Cultivation of Pichia pastoris carrying the scFv anti LDL (-) antibody fragment.

The conditions to effectively cultivate a P. pastoris strain previously genetically modified to produce the single-chain variable fragment anti low density lipoprotein (-) under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter have been investigated in this study. In particular, it was evaluated if, and eventually how, the carbon source (glucose or glycerol) used in the preculture preceding cryopreservation in 20% glycerol influences both cell and antibody fragment productions either in flasks or in bioreactor. Although in flasks the volumetric productivity of the antibody fragment secreted by cells precultured, cryopreserved and reactivated in glycerol was 42.9% higher compared with cells precultured in glucose, the use of glycerol in bioreactor led to a remarkable shortening of the lag phase, thereby increasing it by no less than thrice compared to flasks. These results are quite promising in comparison with those reported in the literature for possible future industrial applications of this cultivation, taking into account that the overall process time was reduced by around 8h.</p></details><hr><h4>Assays to Monitor Pexophagy in Yeast.</h4><p>W. Wang, S. Subramani, Methods Enzymol 588 413 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237113>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pexophagy is a selective autophagy process that degrades damaged and/or superfluous peroxisomes in the yeast vacuole or in mammalian lysosomes. The molecular mechanisms of pexophagy are well studied in yeast. Peroxisomes can be rapidly induced by oleate in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and by oleate or methanol in the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. A number of peroxisomal matrix enzymes, such as 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (thiolase) and alcohol oxidase (AOX), are upregulated correspondingly to meet metabolic demands of the cells. Removal of these peroxisome-inducing carbon sources creates conditions wherein peroxisomes are superfluous and results in pexophagy and the degradation of these peroxisomal matrix enzymes. In this chapter, we discuss different assays to monitor pexophagy in yeast. These assays rely on tracking the localization of the BFP-SKL protein (a peroxisomally targeted version of the blue fluorescent protein) by microscopy, biochemical analysis of the degradation of peroxisomal matrix proteins, thiolase and AOX, and/or measuring the reduction of AOX activity during pexophagy.</p></details><hr><h4>An inhibition enzyme immuno assay exploring recombinant invariant surface glycoprotein and monoclonal antibodies for surveillance of surra in animals.</h4><p>G.

The extracellular domain (ED) of invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG-75) from Trypanosoma evasni has been heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris (X-33). The recombinant ISG-75 (rISG-75ED) was characterized by immunoblot and ELISA, followed by the production of MAbs against rISG-75ED. The MAbs were characterized by immunoblot and then explored in the development of I-ELISA for the detection of surra. The diagnostic potential of the developed test has been evaluated using 1192 field sera sample including cattle, buffalo, donkey, horse and camel. The statistical analysis of the data showed optimum combination of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at 98.8% and 99.2% respectively, with cut-off percentage inhibition (PI) value of >45. The Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement was found to be 0.98. Hence, the diagnostic test developed in the present study can be exploited as a potential and reliable tool in the serodiagnosis and surveillance of surra in animals.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and characteristics of manganese peroxidase from Ganoderma lucidum in Pichia pastoris and its application in the degradation of four dyes and phenol.</h4><p>H.

We subsequently constructed an eukaryotic expression vector, pAO815:: GlMnP, and transferred it into Pichia pastoris SMD116. Recombinant GluMnP1 (rGluMnP1) was with a yield of 126 mg/L and a molecular weight of approximately 37.72 kDa and a specific enzyme activity of 524.61 U/L. The rGluMnP1 could be capable of the decolorization of four types of dyes and the degradation of phenol. Phenol and its principal degradation products including hydroquinone, pyrocatechol, resorcinol, benzoquinone, were detected successfully in the experiments.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The rGluMnP1 could be effectively expressed in Pichia pastoris and with a higher oxidation activity. We infer that, in the initial stages of the reaction, the catechol-mediated cycle should be the principal route of enzymatic degradation of phenol and its oxidation products. This study highlights the potential industrial applications associated with the production of MnP by genetic engineering methods, and the application of industrial wastewater treatment.</p></details><hr><h4>Disruption of genes involved in CORVET complex leads to enhanced secretion of heterologous carboxylesterase only in protease deficient Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L. Marsalek et al., Biotechnol J   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230321>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella spp.) is a popular microbial host for the production of recombinant proteins. Previous studies have shown that mis-sorting to the vacuole can be a bottleneck during production of recombinant secretory proteins in yeast, however, no information was available for P. pastoris. In this work the authors have therefore generated vps (vacuolar protein sorting) mutant strains disrupted in genes involved in the CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) complex at the early stages of endosomal sorting. Both Deltavps8 and Deltavps21 strains contained lower extracellular amounts of heterologous carboxylesterase (CES) compared to the control strain, which could be attributed to a high proteolytic activity present in the supernatants of CORVET engineered strains due to rerouting of vacuolar proteases. Serine proteases were identified to be responsible for this proteolytic degradation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and protease inhibitor assays. Deletion of the major cellular serine protease Prb1 in Deltavps8 and Deltavps21 strains did not only rescue the extracellular CES levels, but even outperformed the parental CES strain (56 and 80% higher yields, respectively). Further deletion of Ybr139W, another serine protease, did not show a further increase in secretion levels. Higher extracellular CES activity and low proteolytic activity were detected also in fed batch cultivation of Deltavps21Deltaprb1 strains, thus confirming that modifying early steps in the vacuolar pathway has a positive impact on heterologous protein secretion.</p></details><hr><h4>Design and pharmacodynamics of recombinant NZ2114 histidine mutants with improved activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</h4><p>H. Chen et al., AMB Express 7 46 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229435>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>NZ2114 is a promising candidate for therapeutic application owing to its potent activity to Staphylococcus aureus. Our objective was to identify NZ2114 derivatives with improved activity through substitution of His16 and His18 with residues Arginine and Lysine. Eight mutants were designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 via pPICZalphaA. Five of them exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus at low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.057-0.454 muM. Among them, H1, H2, and H3 showed ideal pharmacodynamic effects on methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300. The total protein level of H1, H2, and H3 reached 1.70, 1.77 and 1.54 g/l at 120 h of induction in the 5-l fermenter, respectively. They killed over 99.9% of pathogens within 1.5 h at 2x and 4x MIC. The post antibiotic effect of H1, H2 and H3 to S. aureus ATCC43300 was 2.94, 1.75 and 1.55 h at 2x MIC, which was similar with their original peptide NZ2114 (1.43 h) and vancomycin (1.72 h). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated indifferent effects between H1, H2, H3 and vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampicin. Additionally, they had low hemolysis and high stability in different environments (temperature, pH, proteases, and saline ions). All results indicate that H1, H2, and H3 can be produced in large-scale and have potential as therapeutic drugs against MRSA.</p></details><hr><h4>AoS28D, a proline-Xaa carboxypeptidase secreted by Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>K. Salamin et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229206>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prolyl peptidases of the MEROPS S28 family are of particular interest because they are key enzymes in the digestion of proline-rich peptides. A BLAST analysis of the Aspergillus oryzae genome revealed sequences coding for four proteases of the S28 family. Three of these proteases, AoS28A, AoS28B, and AoS28C, were previously characterized as acidic prolyl endopeptidases. The fourth protease, AoS28D, showed high sequence divergence with other S28 proteases and belongs to a phylogenetically distinct cluster together with orthologous proteases from other Aspergillus species. The objective of the present paper was to characterize AoS28D protease in terms of substrate specificity and activity. AoS28D produced by gene overexpression in A. oryzae and in Pichia pastoris was a 70-kDa glycoprotein with a 10-kDa sugar moiety. In contrast with other S28 proteases, AoS28D did not hydrolyze internal Pro-Xaa bonds of several tested peptides. Similarly, to human lysosomal Pro-Xaa carboxypeptidase, AoS28D demonstrated selectivity for cleaving C-terminal Pro-Xaa bonds which are resistant to carboxypeptidases of the S10 family concomitantly secreted by A. oryzae. Therefore, AoS28D could act in synergy with these enzymes during sequential degradation of a peptide from its C-terminus.</p></details><hr><h4>Dynamic genome-scale metabolic modeling of the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>F.

This yeast is mostly grown in dynamic cultivation systems, where the cell's environment is continuously changing and many variables influence process productivity. In this context, a model capable of explaining and predicting cell behavior for the rational design of bioprocesses is highly desirable. Currently, there are five genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of P. pastoris which have been used to predict extracellular cell behavior in stationary conditions.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this work, we assembled a dynamic genome-scale metabolic model for glucose-limited, aerobic cultivations of Pichia pastoris. Starting from an initial model structure for batch and fed-batch cultures, we performed pre/post regression diagnostics to ensure that model parameters were identifiable, significant and sensitive. Once identified, the non-relevant ones were iteratively fixed until a priori robust modeling structures were found for each type of cultivation. Next, the robustness of these reduced structures was confirmed by calibrating the model with new datasets, where no sensitivity, identifiability or significance problems appeared in their parameters. Afterwards, the model was validated for the prediction of batch and fed-batch dynamics in the studied conditions. Lastly, the model was employed as a case study to analyze the metabolic flux distribution of a fed-batch culture and to unravel genetic and process engineering strategies to improve the production of recombinant Human Serum Albumin (HSA). Simulation of single knock-outs indicated that deviation of carbon towards cysteine and tryptophan formation improves HSA production. The deletion of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase could increase the HSA volumetric productivity by 630%. Moreover, given specific bioprocess limitations and strain characteristics, the model suggests that implementation of a decreasing specific growth rate during the feed phase of a fed-batch culture results in a 25% increase of the volumetric productivity of the protein.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this work, we formulated a dynamic genome scale metabolic model of Pichia pastoris that yields realistic metabolic flux distributions throughout dynamic cultivations. The model can be calibrated with experimental data to rationally propose genetic and process engineering strategies to improve the performance of a P. pastoris strain of interest.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of rabies virus glycoprotein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

Different approaches were investigated to develop novel human rabies vaccines with improved features compared to the current available vaccines, among them is the use of heterologous gene expression technology. Here, we describe the expression of the surface rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), which is the major antigen responsible for the induction of protective immunity, in Pichia pastoris. Six transformants were selected according to their gene copy number as determined by real time qPCR. Upon induction by methanol, low level of RABV-G was secreted into the culture medium, around 60 ng/mL. To understand the effect of foreign gene dosage on cellular physiology of P. pastoris, transcriptional analysis of key genes involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway was performed. Results showed that these pathways were highly activated; misfolded RABV-G was degraded in the cytosol via the ERAD mechanism. To study the functionality of the secreted RABV-G, in vitro competitive neutralizing assay was conducted. Data showed the secreted recombinant RABV-G had enabled a reduction of the neutralizing activity of human immune rabies serum, indicating that the secreted recombinant protein had reached its correct conformational form.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Aspergillus aculeatus endo-polygalacturonase in Pichia pastoris by high cell density fermentation and its application in textile scouring.</h4><p>D.

In this study, an endo-polygalacturonase (EndoPG) from Aspergillus aculeatus produced in Pichia pastoris was evaluated for its efficiency as a bioscouring agent while most current bioscouring process has been performed using crude pectinase preparation.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The recombinant EndoPG exhibited a specific activity of 1892.08 U/mg on citrus pectin under the optimal condition at 50 degrees C, pH 5.0 with a V max and K m of 65,451.35 mumol/min/mL and 15.14 mg/mL, respectively. A maximal activity of 2408.70 +/- 26.50 U/mL in the culture supernatant was obtained by high cell density batch fermentation, equivalent to a 4.8 times greater yield than that from shake-flask culture. The recombinant enzyme was shown to be suitable for application as a bioscouring agent, in which the wettability of cotton fabric was increased by treatment with enzyme at 300 U/mL scouring solution at 40 degrees C, pH 5.0 for 1 h. The bio-scoured fabric has comparable wettability to that obtained by conventional chemical scouring, but has higher tensile strength.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The work has demonstrated for the first time functions of A. aculeatus EndoPG on bioscouring in eco-textile processing. EndoPG alone was shown to possess effective scouring activity.

Here, a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 45 endoglucanase from thermophilic fungus Theilavia terrestris (TtCel45A) was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein shows optimal activity at 60 degrees C, pH 4-5. The enzyme exhibits extraordinary thermostability that more than 80% activity was detected after heating at 80 degrees C for 2.5h. The high resolution crystal structures of apo-form enzyme and that in complex with cellobiose and cellotetraose were solved to 1.36-1.58A. The protein folds into two overall regions: one is a six-stranded beta-barrel, and the other one consists of several extended loops. Between the two regions lies the substrate-binding channel, which is an open cleft spanning across the protein surface. A continuous substrate-binding cleft from subsite -4 to +3 were clearly identified in the complex structures. Notably, the flexible V-VI loop (113Gly-114Gly-115Asp-116Leu-117Gly-118Ser) is found to open in the presence of -1 sugar, with D115 and L116 swung away to yield a space to accommodate the catalytic acid D122 and the 2,5B boat conformation of -1 sugar during transition state. Collectively, we characterized the enzyme properties of P. pastoris-expressed TtCel45A and solved high-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme. These results are of great interests in industrial applications and provide new insights into the fundamental understanding of enzyme catalytic mechanism of GH45 endoglucanases.</p></details><hr><h4>A high-throughput expression screening platform to optimize the production of antimicrobial peptides.</h4><p>C.

To avoid laborious trial-and-error testing for the identification of suitable expression constructs, we have developed a small-scale expression screening platform based on a combinatorial plasmid library.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The combinatorial library is based on the Golden Gate cloning system. In each reaction, six donor plasmids (each containing one component: a promoter, fusion partner 1, fusion partner 2, protease cleavage site, gene of interest, or transcriptional terminator) were combined with one acceptor plasmid to yield the final expression construct. As a proof of concept, screening was carried out in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris to study the expression of three different model AMPs with challenging characteristics, such as host toxicity or multiple disulfide bonds. The corresponding genes were successfully cloned in 27 E. coli and 18 P. pastoris expression plasmids, each in a one-step Golden Gate reaction. After transformation, small-scale expression screening in microtiter plates was followed by AMP quantification using a His6 tag-specific ELISA. Depending on the plasmid features and the expression host, the protein yields differed by more than an order of magnitude. This allowed the identification of high producers suitable for larger-scale protein expression.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The optimization of recombinant protein production is best achieved from first principles by initially optimizing the genetic construct. The unrestricted combination of multiple plasmid features yields a comprehensive library of expression strains that can be screened for optimal productivity. The availability of such a platform could benefit all laboratories working in the field of recombinant protein expression.</p></details><hr><h4>An effective and simplified DO-stat control strategy for production of rabies glycoprotein in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L.

In the present study, the G-protein gene of rabies virus CVS strain was cloned, sequenced and expressed in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, as a secreted protein, using a simplified DO-stat control feeding strategy. This strategy involves the addition of methanol when the dissolved oxygen (DO) level rises above the setpoint avoiding methanol accumulation and oxygen limitation. The G-protein expression was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, and western blot assays. Like native G-protein, the recombinant G-protein was found reactive when it was challenged against specific antibodies. The data indicate that the recombinant G-protein can be easily expressed and isolated, and may be useful as a safe source in the production of diagnostic kits and subunit vaccines to prevent rabies.</p></details><hr><h4>Role of N-linked glycosylation in the enzymatic properties of a thermophilic GH 10 xylanase from Aspergillus fumigatus expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

In this study, a xylanase (Af-XYNA) of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 from Aspergillus fumigatus harboring three potential N-glycosylation sites (N87, N124 and N335) was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. The N-glycosylated Af-XYNA (WT) exhibited favorable temperature and pH optima (75 degrees C and pH 5.0) and good thermostability (maintaining stable at 60 degrees C). To reveal the role of N-glycosylation on Af-XYNA, the enzyme was deglycosylated by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (DE) or modified by site-directed mutagenesis at N124 (N124T). The deglycosylated DE and mutant N124T showed narrower pH adaptation range, lower specific activity, and worse pH and thermal stability. Further thermodynamic analysis revealed that the enzyme with higher N-glycosylation degree was more thermostable. This study demonstrated that the effects of glycosylation at different degrees and sites were diverse, in which the glycan linked to N124 played a key role in pH and thermal stability of Af-XYNA.</p></details><hr><h4>Crystallization of a fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase expressed from glycoengineered Pichia pastoris for X-ray and neutron diffraction.</h4><p>W.

The enzyme PMO-2 from Neurospora crassa (NcPMO-2) was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris to facilitate crystallographic studies of the fungal LPMO mechanism. Diffraction resolution and crystal morphology were improved by expressing NcPMO-2 from a glycoengineered strain of P. pastoris and by the use of crystal seeding methods, respectively.

It has a single GH10 catalytic domain with a basic amino acid-rich extension (PVRRK) at C-terminus. In this study, the wild-type (Ccxyn) and C-terminus truncated xylanase (CcXynDelta5C) were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and their characteristics were comparatively analyzed with aims to examine the effect of this extension on the enzyme function. The circular dichorism (CD) analysis indicated that both enzymes in general had a similar structure, but CcXynDelta5C contained less alpha-helices (42.9%) and more random coil contents (35.5%) than CcXyn (47.0% and 32.8%, respectively). Both enzymes had same pH (7.0) and temperature (45 degrees C) optima, and similar substrate specificity on different xylans. They all hydrolyzed beechwood xylan primarily to xylobiose and xylotriose. The amounts of xylobiose and xylotriose account for 91.5% and 92.2 % (w/w) of total xylooligosaccharides (XOS) generated from beechwood by Ccxyn and CcxynDelta5C, respectively. However, truncation of C-terminal 5-amino acids extension significantly improves its thermostability, SDS resistance and pH stability at pH 6.0-9.0. Furthermore, CcxynDelta5C exhibited much lower Km value than Ccxyn (0.27 mg ml(-)(1) vs 0.83 mg ml(-)(1)), therefore, the catalytic efficiency of CcXynDelta5C was 2.4 times higher than that of CcXyn. These properties make CcxynDelta5C a good model for the structure-function study of (alpha/beta)(8)-barrel folded enzyme and a promising candidate for various applications, especially in the detergent industry and XOS production.</p></details><hr><h4>Acute and repeated dose (28 days) toxicity studies in rats and dogs of recombinant batroxobin, a snake venom thrombin-like enzyme expressed from Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

The maximum tolerated dose of the recombinant batroxobin was examined in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and Beagle dogs following Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. The approximate lethal dose of recombinant batroxobin was 10 National Institute of Health (NIH) u/kg in male and female rats. Slight test substance-related effects were clearly in male and female dogs at more than 10 NIH u/kg. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was considered to be greater than 30 NIH u/kg in dogs. To investigate the repeated dose toxicity of batroxobin, the test item was intravenously administered to groups of SD rat and Beagle dog every day for 4 weeks. We observed that all animals survived the duration of the study without any effects on their mortality. There were no effects in both rats and dogs regarding their clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmological examination, urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weightand gross post mortem examinations. The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) of recombinant batroxobin for both males and females is considered to be greater than 2.5 NIH u/kgin rats and 1 NIH u/kg in dogs, respectively. No toxic effects were noted in target organs. In conclusion, these results show a favorable preclinical profile and may contribute clinical development of recombinant batroxobin.</p></details><hr><h4>Rapid screening of cellular stress responses in recombinant Pichia pastoris strains using metabolite profiling.</h4><p>G.

Recombinant enzyme production on the 5-L bioreactor scale (Rs p</p><p><strong>CAE:</strong> 3245UL-1) exceeded the productivity of the wild type strain by a factor of 800. Based on substrate specificity profiling, the purified recombinant Rs pCAE was classified as a p-coumaroyl esterase (pCAE) with a pronounced chlorogenic acid esterase side activity. The Rs pCAE was also active on methyl cinnamate, caffeate and ferulate and on feruloylated saccharides. The unprecedented substrate profile of Rs pCAE together with the lack of sequence similarity to known FAEs or pCAEs suggested that the Rs pCAE represents a new type of enzyme. Hydroxycinnamic acids were released from agro-industrial side-streams, such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB), sugar beet pectin (SBP) and coffee pulp (CP). Overnight incubation of coffee pulp with the Rs pCAE resulted in the efficient release of p-coumaric (100%), caffeic (100%) and ferulic acid (85%) indicating possible applications for the valorization of food processing wastes and for the enhanced degradation of lignified biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>A prime/boost vaccination with HA DNA and Pichia-produced HA protein elicits a strong humoral response in chickens against H5N1.</h4><p>A.

The main goal of this work was to evaluate the immune responses and hemagglutination inhibition potential elicited by a combined DNA/recombinant protein prime/boost vaccination compared to DNA/DNA and protein/protein regimens in chickens. A plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA) from the A/swan/Poland/305-135V08/2006 (H5N1) virus, or the recombinant HA protein produced in Pichia pastoris system, both induced H5 HA-specific humoral immune responses in chickens. In two independent experiments, anti-HA antibodies were detected in sera collected two weeks after the first dose and the response was enhanced by the second dose of a vaccine, regardless of the type of subunit vaccine (DNA or recombinant protein) administered. The serum collected from chickens two weeks after the second dose was characterized by three types of assays: indirect ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and a diagnostic test based on H5 antibody competition. Although the indirect ELISA failed to detect superiority of any of the three vaccine regimens, the other two tests clearly indicated that priming of chickens with the DNA vaccine significantly enhanced the protective potential of the recombinant protein vaccine produced in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Production in Pichia pastoris, antifungal activity and crystal structure of a class I chitinase from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata): Insights into sugar binding mode and hydrolytic action.</h4><p>P.

The recombinant protein was secreted into the culture medium and purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin matrix. The purified chitinase migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two closely-related bands with apparent molecular masses of 34 and 37 kDa. The identity of these bands as VuChiI was demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The recombinant chitinase was able to hydrolyze colloidal chitin but did not exhibit enzymatic activity toward synthetic substrates. The highest hydrolytic activity of the cowpea chitinase toward colloidal chitin was observed at pH 5.0. Furthermore, most VuChiI activity (approximately 92%) was retained after heating to 50 degrees C for 30 min, whereas treatment with 5 mM Cu2+ caused a reduction of 67% in the enzyme's chitinolytic activity. The recombinant protein had antifungal activity as revealed by its ability to inhibit the spore germination and mycelial growth of Penicillium herquei. The three-dimensional structure of VuChiI was resolved at a resolution of 1.55 A by molecular replacement. The refined model had 245 amino acid residues and 381 water molecules, and the final R-factor and Rfree values were 14.78 and 17.22%, respectively. The catalytic domain of VuChiI adopts an alpha-helix-rich fold, stabilized by 3 disulfide bridges and possessing a wide catalytic cleft. Analysis of the crystallographic model and molecular docking calculations using chito-oligosaccharides provided evidences about the VuChiI residues involved in sugar binding and catalysis, and a possible mechanism of antifungal action is suggested.</p></details><hr><h4>Methanol-Independent Protein Expression by AOX1 Promoter with trans-Acting Elements Engineering and Glucose-Glycerol-Shift Induction in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. Wang et al., Sci Rep 7 41850 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150747>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1) of Pichia pastoris is commonly used for high level expression of recombinant proteins. While the safety risk of methanol and tough process control for methanol induction usually cause problems especially in large-scale fermentation. By testing the functions of trans-acting elements of PAOX1 and combinatorially engineering of them, we successfully constructed a methanol-free PAOX1 start-up strain, in which, three transcription repressors were identified and deleted and, one transcription activator were overexpressed. The strain expressed 77% GFP levels in glycerol compared to the wide-type in methanol. Then, insulin precursor (IP) was expressed, taking which as a model, we developed a novel glucose-glycerol-shift induced PAOX1 start-up for this methanol-free strain. A batch phase with glucose of 40 g/L followed by controlling residual glucose not lower than 20 g/L was compatible for supporting cell growth and suppressing PAOX1. Then, glycerol induction was started after glucose used up. Accordingly, an optimal bioprocess was further determined, generating a high IP production of 2.46 g/L in a 5-L bioreactor with dramatical decrease of oxygen consumption and heat evolution comparing with the wild-type in methanol. This mutant and bioprocess represent a safe and efficient alternative to the traditional glycerol-repressed/methanol-induced PAOX1 system.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory Expression and Characterization of Chinese Narcissus GNA-Like Lectin in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

In the present paper, the codon-optimized ntl gene was transformed into the yeast Pichia pastoris; SDS-PAGE gel and western blotting analysis revealed that the recombinant lectin was expressed successfully in Pichia yeast. The similarity between the recombinant NTL and the native NTL was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and hemagglutination assay further. In the 5-L scale fermentator, the protein yield was as high as 1.2 g/L after fermentation for 96 h. In addition, the effect of metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cu2+), acid, and alkaline on hemagglutinating activity of NTL was tested, which provided biochemical characterizations of the mannose-binding lectin from Chinese Narcissus.</p></details><hr><h4>Effects of glycerol supply and specific growth rate on methanol-free production of CALB by P. pastoris: functional characterisation of a novel promoter.</h4><p>V. Looser et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 3163 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130631>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella sp.) yeast can secrete pure recombinant proteins at high rates, it is a desirable production system. The function of a novel synthetic variant of the AOX1 promoter was characterised comprehensively using a strain secreting Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a model. A new time-saving approach was introduced to determine, in only one experiment, the hitherto unknown relationship between specific product formation rate (q p) and specific growth rate (mu). Tight control of recombinant protein formation was possible in the absence of methanol, while using glycerol as a sole carbon/energy source. CALB was not synthesised during batch cultivation in excess glycerol (>10 g l-1) and at a growth rate close to mu max (0.15 h-1). Between 0.017 and 0.115 h-1 in glycerol-limited fedbatch cultures, basal levels of q p > 0.4 mg g-1 h-1 CALB were reached, independent of the mu at which the culture grew. At mu > 0.04 h-1, an elevated q p occurred temporarily during the first 20 h after changing to fedbatch mode and decreased thereafter to basal. In order to accelerate the determination of the q p(mu) relationship (kinetics of product formation), the entire mu range was covered in a single fedbatch experiment. By linearly increasing and decreasing glycerol addition rates, mu values were repeatedly shifted from 0.004 to 0.074 h-1 and vice versa. Changes in q p were related to changes in mu. A rough estimation of mu range suitable for production was possible in a single fedbatch, thus significantly reducing the experimental input over previous approaches comprising several experiments.</p></details><hr><h4>Novel function of Wsc proteins as a methanol-sensing machinery in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Ohsawa, H. Yurimoto, Y. Sakai, Mol Microbiol 104 349 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28127815>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Wsc family proteins are plasma membrane spanning sensor proteins conserved from yeasts to mammalian cells. We studied the functional roles of Wsc family proteins in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and found that PpWsc1 and PpWsc3 function as methanol-sensors during growth on methanol. PpWsc1 responds to a lower range of methanol concentrations than PpWsc3. PpWsc1, but not PpWsc3, also functions during high temperature stress, but PpWsc1 senses methanol as a signal that is distinct from high-temperature stress. We also found that PpRom2, which is known to function downstream of the Wsc family proteins in the cell wall integrity pathway, was also involved in sensing methanol. Based on these results, these PpWsc family proteins were demonstrated to be involved in sensing methanol and transmitting the signal via their cytoplasmic tail to the nucleus via PpRom2, which plays a critical role in regulating expression of a subset of methanol-inducible genes to coordinate well-balanced methanol metabolism.</p></details><hr><h4>A Recombinant Human Anti-Platelet scFv Antibody Produced in Pichia pastoris for Atheroma Targeting.</h4><p>A.

Here, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and immunoreactivity assessment of a recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a human anti-alphaIIbbeta3 antibody (HuAb) selected to target atheromatous lesions for the presence of platelets. Indeed, platelets within atheroma plaques have been shown to play a role in inflammation, in platelet-leucocyte aggregates and in thrombi formation and might thus be considered relevant biomarkers of atherosclerotic progression. The DNA sequence that encodes the anti-alphaIIbbeta3 TEG4 scFv previously obtained from a phage-display selection on activated platelets, was inserted into the eukaryote vector (pPICZalphaA) in fusion with a tag sequence encoding 2 cysteines useable for specific probes grafting experiments. The recombinant protein was expressed at high yields in Pichia pastoris (30 mg/L culture). The advantage of P. pastoris as an expression system is the production and secretion of recombinant proteins in the supernatant, ruling out the difficulties encountered when scFv are produced in the cytoplasm of bacteria (low yield, low solubility and reduced affinity). The improved conditions allowed for the recovery of highly purified and biologically active scFv fragments ready to be grafted in a site-directed way to nanoparticles for the imaging of atherosclerotic plaques involving inflammatory processes and thus at high risk of instability.</p></details><hr><h4>Luciferin-Regenerating Enzyme Crystal Structure Is Solved but its Function Is Still Unclear.</h4><p>S.

According to crystal structure of LRE, it is a beta-propeller protein which is a type of all beta-protein architecture. In this overview, reinvestigation of the luciferase-based LRE assays and its function is reported. Until now, sequence of LRE genes from four different species of firefly has been reported. In spite of previous reports, T-LRE (from Lampyris turkestanicus) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as well as Pichia pastoris in a nonsoluble form as inclusion body. According to recent investigations, bioluminescent signal of soluble T-LRE-luciferase-coupled assay increased and then reached an equilibrium state in the presence of D-cysteine. In addition, the results revealed that both D- and L-cysteine in the absence of T-LRE caused a significant increase in bioluminescence intensity of luciferase over a long time. Based on activity measurements and spectroscopic results, D-cysteine increased the activity of luciferase due to its redox potential and induction of conformational changes in structure and kinetics properties. In conclusion, in spite of previous reports on the effect of LRE (at least T-LRE) on luciferase activity, most of the increase in luciferase activity is caused by direct effect of D-cysteine on structure and activity of firefly luciferase. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis cannot support the presence of LRE in peroxisome of photocytes in firefly lanterns.</p></details><hr><h4>Single-molecule detection of protein efflux from microorganisms using fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotube sensor arrays.</h4><p>M.

Here, we demonstrate label-free detection of individual proteins from Escherichia coli (bacteria) and Pichia pastoris (yeast) immobilized in a microfluidic chamber, measuring protein efflux from single organisms in real time. The array is fabricated using non-covalent conjugation of an aptamer-anchor polynucleotide sequence to near-infrared emissive single-walled carbon nanotubes, using a variable chemical spacer shown to optimize sensor response. Unlabelled RAP1 GTPase and HIV integrase proteins were selectively detected from various cell lines, via large near-infrared fluorescent turn-on responses. We show that the process of E. coli induction, protein synthesis and protein export is highly stochastic, yielding variability in protein secretion, with E. coli cells undergoing division under starved conditions producing 66% fewer secreted protein products than their non-dividing counterparts. We further demonstrate the detection of a unique protein product resulting from T7 bacteriophage infection of E. coli, illustrating that nanosensor arrays can enable real-time, single-cell analysis of a broad range of protein products from various cell types.</p></details><hr><h4>Extremely low frequency magnetic field enhances glucose oxidase expression in Pichia pastoris GS115.</h4><p>A.

GOX encoding gene from A. niger was expressed in P. pastoris GS115 employing methanol inducible AOX1 promoter. From resistant transformants to high zeocin concentrations, maximum GOX expressing transformant was isolated and used throughout the study. Optimal environmental conditions for achieving maximum glucose oxidase (GOX) production was determined by varying temperature (20-30 degrees C) and final methanol concentration from 0.25-1% (v/v). Maximum GOX production was obtained at 20 degrees C and 0.25% (v/v) final methanol concentration. Exposure carried out at extremely low frequencies ranging from 1 to 5Hz and the field strength of 30-100mT unceasingly. Biomass, GOX, protease productions and cell viability were examined in exposed and non-exposed groups every 12h up to 96h. Among different exposure conditions, the frequency of 2.8Hz significantly increased GOX production and cell viability, decreased non-specific protease activity and improved biomass production regardless of changes in field intensity. Overall, supported by results, P. pastoris exposure to ELF-MF in certain circumstances could effectively further increase maximum production of GOX as achieved by optimized preliminary environmental parameters.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical characterization of thermostable beta-1,4-mannanase belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 134 from Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>K.

Recombinant AoMan134A was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the purified enzyme produced mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, and mannopentaose from galactose-free beta-mannan, with mannotriose being the predominant reaction product. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of AoMan134A was 6.8-fold higher toward galactomannan from locust bean gum, than toward galactomannan from guar gum, but similar toward galactomannan from locust bean gum and glucomannan from konjac flour. After incubation at 70 degrees C for 120 min, the activity of AoMan134A toward glucomannan decreased to 50% of the maximal activity at 30 degrees C. AoMan134A retained 50% of its beta-1,4-mannanase activity after heating at 90 degrees C for 30 min, indicating that AoMan134A is thermostable. Furthermore, AoMan134A was stable within a neutral-to-alkaline pH range, as well as exhibiting stability in the presence of a range of organic solvents, detergents, and metal ions. These findings suggest that AoMan134A could be useful in a diverse range of industries where conversion of beta-mannans is of prime importance.</p></details><hr><h4>Direct bioethanol production from wheat straw using xylose/glucose co-fermentation by co-culture of two recombinant yeasts.</h4><p>Y.

Recombinant S. cerevisiae coexpressing three types of cellulase and recombinant P. pastoris coexpressing two types of xylanase were constructed, respectively. All cellulases and xylanases were successfully expressed and similar extracellular activity was demonstrated. The maximum ethanol concentration of 32.6 g L-1 with the yield 0.42 g g-1 was achieved from wheat straw corresponding to 100 g L-1 of total sugar after 80 h co-fermentation, which corresponds to 82.6% of the theoretical yield. These results demonstrate that the direct and efficient ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials is accomplished by simultaneous saccharification (cellulose and hemicellulose) and co-fermentation (glucose and xylose) with the co-culture of the two recombinant yeasts.</p></details><hr><h4>A Recombinant Highly Thermostable beta-Mannanase (ReTMan26) from Thermophilic Bacillus subtilis (TBS2) Expressed in Pichia pastoris and Its pH and Temperature Stability.</h4><p>Z.

The maximum activity of the recombinant thermostable beta-mannanase (ReTMan26) was 5435 U/mL, which was obtained by high-density, fed-batch cultivation after 168-h induction with methanol in a 50-L bioreactor. The protein yield reached 3.29 mg/mL, and the protein had a molecular weight of ~42 kDa. After fermentation, ReTMan26 was purified using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane and Sephadex G-75 column. The pH and temperature optima of purified ReTMan26 were pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively, and the enzyme was stable at pH 2.0-8.0 and was active at 20-100 degrees C. HPLC analysis of the products of locust bean gum hydrolysis showed that the mannan-oligosaccharide content was 62.5%. ReTMan26 retained 58.6% of its maximum activity after treatment at 100 degrees C for 10 min, which was higher than any other beta-mannanase reported up to now, suggesting its potential for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Functional Characterization of the N-Terminal C2 Domain from Arabidopsis thaliana Phospholipase Dalpha and Dbeta.</h4><p>R.

In this study, we expressed and partially purified catalytically active PLDalpha from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPLDalpha) in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant AtPLDalpha was found to be NVEETIGV and thus to lack the first 35 amino acid belonging to the C2 domain, as found in other recombinant or plant purified PLDs. To investigate the impact of such a cleavage on the functionality of C2 domains, we expressed, in E. coli, purified, and refolded the mature-like form of the C2 domain of the AtPLDalpha along with its equivalent C2 domain of the AtPLDbeta, for the sake of comparison. Using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and dot-blot assays, both C2 domains were shown to bind phosphatidylglycerol in a Ca2+-independent manner while phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine binding were found to be enhanced in the presence of Ca2+. Amino acid sequence alignment and molecular modeling of both C2 domains with known C2 domain structures revealed the presence of a novel Ca2+-binding site within the C2 domain of AtPLDalpha.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of human pro-relaxin H2 in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

All these findings make relaxin a potential drug for diverse medical applications. Its precursor, pro-relaxin, is an 18 kDa protein, that shows activity in in vitro assays. Since extraction of relaxin from animal tissues raises several issues, prokaryotes and eukaryotes were both used as expression systems for recombinant relaxin production. Most productive results were obtained when using Escherichia coli as a host for human relaxin expression. However, in such host, relaxin precipitated in the form of inclusion bodies and, therefore, required several expensive recovery steps as cell lysis, refolding and reduction.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> To overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression here we report the production and purification of secreted human pro-relaxin H2 by using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host. The methanol inducible promoter AOX1 was used to drive expression of the native and histidine tagged forms of pro-relaxin H2 in dual phase fed-batch experiments on the 22 L scale. Both protein forms presented the correct structure, as determined by mass spectrometry and western blotting analyses, and demonstrated to be biologically active in immune enzymatic assays. The presence of the tag allowed to simplify pro-relaxin purification obtaining higher purity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This work presents a strategy for microbial production of recombinant human pro-relaxin H2 in Pichia pastoris that allowed the obtainment of biologically active pro-hormone, with a final concentration in the fermentation broth ranging between 10 and 14 mg/L of product, as determined by densitometric analyses.</p></details><hr><h4>Age-related macular degeneration associated polymorphism rs10490924 in ARMS2 results in deficiency of a complement activator.</h4><p>S.

The polymorphism rs10490924 in the ARMS2 gene is highly associated with AMD and linked to an indel mutation (del443ins54), the latter inducing mRNA instability. At present, the function of the ARMS2 protein, the exact cellular sources in the retina and the biological consequences of the rs10490924 polymorphism are unclear.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> Recombinant ARMS2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and protein functions were studied regarding cell surface binding and complement activation in human serum using fluoresence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as well as laser scanning microscopy (LSM). Biolayer interferometry defined protein interactions. Furthermore, endogenous ARMS2 gene expression was studied in human blood derived monocytes and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iPSdM) by PCR and LSM. The ARMS2 protein was localized in human genotyped retinal sections and in purified monocytes derived from AMD patients without the ARMS2 risk variant by LSM. ARMS2 expression in monocytes under oxidative stress was determined by Western blot analysis.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Here, we demonstrate for the first time that ARMS2 functions as surface complement regulator. Recombinant ARMS2 binds to human apoptotic and necrotic cells and initiates complement activation by recruiting the complement activator properdin. ARMS2-properdin complexes augment C3b surface opsonization for phagocytosis. We also demonstrate for the first time expression of ARMS2 in human monocytes especially under oxidative stress and in microglia cells of the human retina. The ARMS2 protein is absent in monocytes and also in microglia cells, derived from patients homozygous for the ARMS2 AMD risk variant (rs10490924).</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> ARMS2 is likely involved in complement-mediated clearance of cellular debris. As AMD patients present with accumulated proteins and lipids on Bruch's membrane, ARMS2 protein deficiency due to the genetic risk variant might be involved in drusen formation.</p></details><hr><h4>A genetic method to enhance the accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine in yeast.</h4><p>M.

The enzymes showed similar enzymatic properties (maximal activities at pH 6.0-6.5 and 65 degrees C) but varied in catalytic efficiency and cleaving actions. MtXyn11A, MtXyn11At, and MtXyn11C mainly produced xylobiose (59-62%), xylose (16-20%), and xylotriose (16-19%), while MtXyn11B released xylobiose (51%), xylotriose (32%), and xylose (12%) as the main products. When using the xylan hydrolysates of different xylanases as the carbon source, four probiotic Lactobacillus strains Lactobacillus brevis 1.2028, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei BL23, and Lactobacillus plantarum WCSF1 were confirmed to use the xylooligosaccharides efficiently (83.8-98.2%), with L. brevis 1.2028 as the greatest.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and characteristics of the recombinant extracellular bifunctional endoglucanase of the polyextremophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans and its applicability in saccharifying agro-residues.</h4><p>R.

A higher titre of recombinant BhCell-Xyl was attained after induction (4.8 U mL-1) as compared to that of the constitutive production (2.1 U mL-1). The recombinant P. pastoris strains integrated two copies of BhCell-Xyl under AOX and GAP promoters. The pure recombinant BhCell-Xyl is a glycoprotein of 66 kDa, which is optimally active at 60 degrees C and pH 6.0 and 8.0. Glycosylated BhCell-Xyl exhibits higher thermostability than that of the native enzyme. The analysis of amino acids of BhCell-Xyl revealed that multiple factors are responsible for its thermostability. Kinetics and in silico analysis of the enzyme suggested that BhCell-Xyl has one active site for both endocellulase and endoxylanase activities. The BhCell-Xyl possesses a carbohydrate binding domain and saccharifies lignocellulosic agro-residues to xylo-oligosaccharides and cello-oligosaccharides, suggesting its potential application in generating fermentable sugars from renewable agro-residues for biofuel and fine chemical industries.</p></details><hr><h4>N-glycosylation converts non-glycoproteins into mannose receptor ligands and reveals antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo.</h4><p>C. Kreer et al., Oncotarget 8 6857 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28036287>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>N-glycosylation is generally accepted to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens because of two main reasons. First, the attachment of glycans enables recognition by endocytic receptors like the mannose receptor (MR) and hence increased uptake by dendritic cells (DCs). Second, foreign glycans are postulated to be immunostimulatory and their recognition could induce DC activation. However, a direct comparison between the immunogenicity of N-glycosylated vs. de-glycosylated proteins in vivo and a direct effect of N-glycosylated antigens on the intrinsic capacity of DCs to activate T cells have not been assessed so far.To analyze whether enforced N-glycosylation is a suited strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of non-glycosylated antigens for vaccination studies, we targeted non-glycoproteins towards the MR by introduction of artificial N-glycosylation using the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (previously termed Pichia pastoris). We could demonstrate that the introduction of a single N-X-S/T motif was sufficient for efficient MR-binding and internalization. However, addition of N-glycosylated proteins neither influenced DC maturation nor their general capacity to activate T cells, pointing out that enforced N-glycosylation does not increase the immunogenicity of the antigen per se. Additionally, increased antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo after injection of N-glycosylated compared to de-glycosylated proteins were observed but this effect strongly depended on the epitope tested. A beneficial effect of N-glycosylation on antibody production could not be detected, which might be due to MR-cross-linking on DCs and to concomitant differences in IL-6 production by CD4+ T cells.These observations point out that the effect of N-glycosylation on antigen immunogenicity can vary between different antigens and therefore might have important implications for the development of vaccines using K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>A comparative study of glycerol and sorbitol as co-substrates in methanol-induced cultures of Pichia pastoris: temperature effect and scale-up simulation.</h4><p>J.

Thus, the effect of using these co-substrates on the production of Rhyzopus oryzae lipase (ROL) by P. pastoris was compared in continuous cultures growing at the same micro at either 22 or 30 degrees C. Results show that using glycerol as co-substrate led to higher volumetric productivities, and lower specific and volumetric methanol consumption rates. Scale-up simulation with 10-10,000 L bioreactor sizes indicated that glycerol produced the highest volumetric productivity of ROL with lower aeration requirements. Therefore, glycerol rises as a better option than sorbitol in ROL production.</p></details><hr><h4>Biotechnological exploitation of Tetrapisispora phaffii killer toxin: heterologous production in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris).</h4><p>R. Chessa et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 2931 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28032192>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The use of natural antimicrobials from plants, animals and microorganisms to inhibit the growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms is becoming more frequent. This parallels the increased consumer interest towards consumption of minimally processed food and 'greener' food and beverage additives. Among the natural antimicrobials of microbial origin, the killer toxin produced by the yeast Tetrapisispora phaffii, known as Kpkt, appears to be a promising natural antimicrobial agent. Kpkt is a glycoprotein with beta-1,3-glucanase and killer activity, which induces ultrastructural modifications to the cell wall of yeast of the genera Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora and Zygosaccharomyces. Moreover, Kpkt maintains its killer activity in grape must for at least 14 days under winemaking conditions, thus suggesting its use against spoilage yeast in wine making and the sweet beverage industry. Here, the aim was to explore the possibility of high production of Kpkt for biotechnological exploitation. Molecular tools for heterologous production of Kpkt in Komagataella phaffii GS115 were developed, and two recombinant clones that produce up to 23 mg/L recombinant Kpkt (rKpkt) were obtained. Similar to native Kpkt, rKpkt has beta-glucanase and killer activities. Moreover, it shows a wider spectrum of action with respect to native Kpkt. This includes effects on Dekkera bruxellensis, a spoilage yeast of interest not only in wine making, but also for the biofuel industry, thus widening the potential applications of this rKpkt.</p></details><hr><h4>A capture method based on the VC1 domain reveals new binding properties of the human receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).</h4><p>G. Degani et al., Redox Biol 11 275 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28013188>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Advanced Glycation and Lipoxidation End products (AGEs and ALEs) are a heterogeneous class of compounds derived from the non-enzymatic glycation or protein adduction by lipoxidation break-down products. The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is involved in the progression of chronic diseases based on persistent inflammatory state and oxidative stress. RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and the inhibition of the interaction with its ligands or of the ligand accumulation have a potential therapeutic effect. The N-terminal domain of RAGE, the V domain, is the major site of AGEs binding and is stabilized by the adjacent C1 domain. In this study, we set up an affinity assay relying on the extremely specific biological interaction AGEs ligands have for the VC1 domain. A glycosylated form of VC1, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, was attached to magnetic beads and used as insoluble affinity matrix (VC1-resin). The VC1 interaction assay was employed to isolate specific VC1 binding partners from in vitro generated AGE-albumins and modifications were identified/localized by mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, this method also led to the isolation of ALEs produced by malondialdehyde treatment of albumins. Computational studies provided a rational-based interpretation of the contacts established by specific modified residues and amino acids of the V domain. The validation of VC1-resin in capturing AGE-albumins from complex biological mixtures such as plasma and milk, may lead to the identification of new RAGE ligands potentially involved in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses, independently of their structures or physical properties, and without the use of any covalent derivatization process. In addition, the method can be applied to the identification of antagonists of RAGE-ligand interaction.</p></details><hr><h4>Physicochemical characterization and immunological properties of Pichia pastoris based HPV16L1 and 18L1 virus like particles.</h4><p>G.

Presently HPV vaccines, which are commercially available, are adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLPs) expressed from various recombinant expression systems. They have been characterized by different methods as safe, pure, and potent HPV vaccine antigens. We cloned and expressed L1 proteins of HPV16 & 18 in Pichia pastoris and tested their immunogenicity. We observed that HPVL1 proteins (16L1 and 18L1) are expressed in Pichia pastoris at high levels. Critical physicochemical parameters of these HPV recombinant L1 proteins were characterized by SDS PAGE, western blotting, peptide mapping, glycosylation pattern, mass spectrometry, host cell DNA and protein analysis, electron microscopy, and immunogenicity analysis. These data establish a blueprint of HPV recombinant protein antigens for standardizing & developing an alternative high-quality, cost-effective vaccine for HPV as well as similar recombinant protein-based vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Rational design for the stability improvement of Armillariella tabescens beta-mannanase MAN47 based on N-glycosylation modification.</h4><p>W.

In this study, we sought to improve the stability and protease resistance of a recombinant beta-mannanase, MAN47 from Armillariella tabescens, through rationally designed N-glycosylation. Based on homology modeling, molecular docking, secondary structure analysis and glycosylation feasibility analysis, an enhanced aromatic sequon sequence was introduced into specific MAN47 loop regions to facilitate N-glycosylation. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168, and their thermal stability, pH stability, trypsin resistance and pepsin resistance were determined. Two mutant MAN47 enzymes, g-123 and g-347, were glycosylated as expected when expressed in yeast, and their thermal stability, pH stability, and protease resistance were significantly improved compared to the wild-type enzyme. An enzyme with multiple stability characterizations has broad prospects in practical applications, and the rational design N-glycosylation strategy may have applications in simultaneously improving several properties of other biotechnological targets.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of a beta-glucosidase from the xylophagous cockroach Panesthia angustipennis spadica displaying high specific activity for cellobiose.</h4><p>Y.

Post-translational modification and N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that the expression product was comprised of two polypeptides with different N-terminal sequences, presumably due to the presence of lysine-arginine (KR) sequence in the putative mature region. Substrate specificity analysis showed that PaBG1b hydrolyzed a broad range of substrates including cellohexaose, with the preference for aryl beta-d-fucosyl linkage and laminaribiose. Although the glucose tolerance of PaBG1b was moderate (Ki=200.3+/-1.1mM), PaBG1b demonstrated high specific activity and catalytic efficiency towards cellobiose with Vmax and kcat/Km values of 436.7+/-6.3U/mg and 109.8mM-1s-1, respectively. In addition, PaBG1b was not inhibited by cellobiose up to the highest concentration tested (100mM). Collectively, our work demonstrates that PaBG1b is a potentially valuable BG for commercial bioethanol production from cellulose.</p></details><hr><h4>Gene cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of a Coprinopsis cinerea endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanase.</h4><p>J. Wang, L. Kang, Z. Liu, S.

ENG16A only acts on substrates containing beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds but not on substrates containing only beta-1,4- or beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds. Interestingly, compared to the activity of this enzyme towards carboxymethyl (CM)-pachyman containing only beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, its activity towards barley beta-glucan containing both beta-1,3-glycosidic and beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds was increased by 64.72 %,, its activity towards laminarin containing both beta-1,3-glycosidic and beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds was decreased by 50.83 %. In addition, ENG16A has a higher Km value and Vmax for barley beta-glucan than laminarin, which may be related to the fact that barley beta-glucan contains mainly beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds mixed with a few beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, whereas laminarin mainly contains beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds with a few beta-1,6-branched glucose residues. The adjacent beta-1,4-glycosidic bond promotes ENG16A to hydrolyse beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, leading to an increased Vmax; the nearby beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds inhibited its hydrolysis of beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, resulting in a decreased Vmax. This property is suggested to be related to the mechanism that C. cinerea uses to degrade and utilize hemicellulose in straw medium and to protect its cell wall during the mycelium growth stage.</p></details><hr><h4>Biologically active recombinant carp LH as a spawning-inducing agent for carp.</h4><p>J.

The main goal of this study was the production of recombinant gonadotropins (GtHs) on a large scale to serve as an alternative to currently used agents. We produced carp (c) recombinant (r) Lh as a single chain in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris Lha subunit was joined with Lhb subunit with a flexible linker of three glycine-serine repeats and six Histidines to form a mature protein, the beta-subunit formed the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit formed the C-terminal part. The ability of the rcLh to elicit biological response was tested by in vivo stimulation of estradiol (E2) and 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and by its in vivo potency to induce ovulation and spawning induction. rcLh tested in this work significantly enhanced both E2 and DHP secretion in a dose-dependent manner similar to the results obtained with CPE. E2 levels showed a moderate rise following the priming injection and a subsequent decrease during the rest of the trial. DHP levels were only increased after the resolving injection, approximately 5 h before spawning. At the highest dose of rcLh (350 microg/kg BW), the recombinant protein was more efficient than CPE in terms of both spawning success and fertilization rate. It is shown here that rcLh can elicit the secretion of DHP in vivo and actually trigger spawning. These novel findings introduce the potential of utilizing recombinant gonadotropins in aquaculture.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of recombinant human epidermal growth factor in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

For this aim, the hEGF gene was cloned into the pPIC9K expression vector, and then integrated into P. pastoris by electroporation. ELISA-based assay showed that the amount of hEGF secreted into the medium can be affected by the fermentation conditions especially by culture medium, pH and temperature. The best medium for the optimal hEGF production was BMMY buffered at a pH range of 6.0 and 7.0. The highest amount of hEGF with an average yield of 2.27mug/mL was obtained through an induction of the culture with 0.5% (v/v) methanol for 60h. The artificial neural network (ANN) analysis revealed that changes in both pH and temperature significantly affected the hEGF production with the pH change had slightly higher impact on hEGF production than variations in the temperature.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Paranosema (Antonospora) locustae hexokinase in lepidopteran, Sf9, cells is followed by accumulation of the microsporidian protein in insect cell nuclei.</h4><p>S.

Here, the microsporidian protein was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and in lepidopteran Sf9 cells. During heterologous expression, P. locustae hexokinase was accumulated in the nuclei of insect cells but not in yeast cell nuclei. This confirms nuclear localization of hexokinase secreted by microsporidia into infected host cells and suggests convenient model for its further study.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural characterization of the alpha-mating factor prepro-peptide for secretion of recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Chahal et al., Gene 598 50 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27984193>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been used extensively for expressing recombinant proteins because it combines the ease of genetic manipulation, the ability to provide complex posttranslational modifications and the capacity for efficient protein secretion. The most successful and commonly used secretion signal leader in Pichia pastoris has been the alpha mating factor (MATalpha) prepro secretion signal. However, limitations exist as some proteins cannot be secreted efficiently, leading to strategies to enhance secretion efficiency by modifying the secretion signal leader. Based on a Jpred secondary structure prediction and knob-socket modeling of tertiary structure, numerous deletions and duplications of the MATalpha prepro leader were engineered to evaluate the correlation between predicted secondary structure and the secretion level of the reporters horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Candida antarctica lipase B. In addition, circular dichroism analyses were completed for the wild type and several mutant pro-peptides to evaluate actual differences in secondary structure. The results lead to a new model of MATalpha pro-peptide signal leader, which suggests that the N and C-termini of MATalpha pro-peptide need to be presented in a specific orientation for proper interaction with the cellular secretion machinery and for efficient protein secretion.</p></details><hr><h4>Synthetic Core Promoters as Universal Parts for Fine-Tuning Expression in Different Yeast Species.</h4><p>R. M.

A key concept of synthetic biology is the development of modular parts that can be used in different contexts. Here, we have applied a computational multifactor design approach to generate de novo synthetic core promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) for yeast cells. In contrast to upstream cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), core promoters are typically not subject to specific regulation, making them ideal engineering targets for gene expression fine-tuning. 112 synthetic core promoter sequences were designed on the basis of the sequence/function relationship of natural core promoters, nucleosome occupancy and the presence of short motifs. The synthetic core promoters were fused to the Pichia pastoris AOX1 CRM, and the resulting activity spanned more than a 200-fold range (0.3% to 70.6% of the wild type AOX1 level). The top-ten synthetic core promoters with highest activity were fused to six additional CRMs (three in P. pastoris and three in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Inducible CRM constructs showed significantly higher activity than constitutive CRMs, reaching up to 176% of natural core promoters. Comparing the activity of the same synthetic core promoters fused to different CRMs revealed high correlations only for CRMs within the same organism. These data suggest that modularity is maintained to some extent but only within the same organism. Due to the conserved role of eukaryotic core promoters, this rational design concept may be transferred to other organisms as a generic engineering tool.</p></details><hr><h4>Non-canonical integration events in Pichia pastoris encountered during standard transformation analysed with genome sequencing.</h4><p>J.

Typically, the expression cassette is integrated into the genome via homologous recombination. Due to unknown integration events, a large clonal variability is often encountered consisting of clones with different productivities as well as aberrant morphological or growth characteristics. In this study, we analysed several clones with abnormal colony morphology and discovered unpredicted integration events via whole genome sequencing. These include (i) the relocation of the locus targeted for replacement to another chromosome (ii) co-integration of DNA from the E. coli plasmid host and (iii) the disruption of untargeted genes affecting colony morphology. Most of these events have not been reported so far in literature and present challenges for genetic engineering approaches in this yeast. Especially, the presence and independent activity of E. coli DNA elements in P. pastoris is of concern. In our study, we provide a deeper insight into these events and their potential origins. Steps preventing or reducing the risk for these phenomena are proposed and will help scientists working on genetic engineering of P. pastoris or similar non-conventional yeast to better understand and control clonal variability.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression, characterization, and application of a phospholipase B from Fusarium oxysporum.</h4><p>L.

The gene product was identified as a phospholipase B (PLB). The engineered P. pastoris was further cultured in a 3.6-L bioreactor. After optimization of the induction conditions, this system produced 6.6mgmL-1 protein and 6503.8UmL-1 PLB activity in the culture medium. Efficient expression of this PLB in P. pastoris should reduce the costs of production and application. The purified enzyme, with a specific activity of 1170Umg-1, was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. The results of a degumming experiment performed using the recombinant PLB showed that the phosphorus content of a test oil was decreased from 75.88ppm to 3.3ppm in 2h under optimal reaction conditions. This study provides a basis for the industrial use of F. oxysporum PLB in oil degumming applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Kinase Screening in Pichia pastoris Identified Promising Targets Involved in Cell Growth and Alcohol Oxidase 1 Promoter (PAOX1) Regulation.</h4><p>W.

However, the complicated signaling pathways involved in PAOX1 regulation when supplemented with different carbon sources are poorly understood. Here we constructed a kinase deletion library in P. pastoris and identified 27 mutants which showed peculiar phenotypes in cell growth or PAOX1 regulation. We analyzed both annotations and possible functions of these 27 targets, and then focused on the MAP kinase Hog1. In order to locate its potential downstream components, we performed the phosphoproteome analysis on glycerol cultured WT and Deltahog1 strains and identified 157 differentially phosphorylated proteins. Our results identified important kinases involved in P. pastoris cell growth and PAOX1 regulation, which could serve as valuable targets for further mechanistic studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Characteristics and applications of recombinant thermostable amylopullulanase of Geobacillus thermoleovorans secreted by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

The expression of the gene (Gt-apuDeltaC) was higher under GAP promoter (36.2 U ml-1, alpha-amylase; 33.5 U ml-1, pullulanase) than that under AOX1 promoter (32.5 and 28.6 U ml-1). The heavily glycosylated Gt-apuDeltaC from the recombinant P. pastoris displays higher substrate specificity, thermal stability and starch saccharification efficiency than that expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme hydrolyses maltotriose and maltotetraose unlike that expressed in E. coli. The enzyme action on wheat bran liberates maltose and glucose without detectable amount(s) of maltooligosaccharides. The sugars released from wheat bran (glucose and maltose) could be fractionated by ultrafiltration, as confirmed by TLC and HPLC analysis. This is the first report on the production of recombinant amylopullulanase extracellularly in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Effect of Glycosylation on the Biocatalytic Properties of Hydroxynitrile Lyase from the Passion Fruit, Passiflora edulis: A Comparison of Natural and Recombinant Enzymes.</h4><p>A.

Cyanohydrins are important building blocks for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Thus, to enhance production yields of PeHNL for industrial applications, we cloned and expressed recombinant PeHNL in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris GS115 cells without a signal peptide sequence. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of N-glycosylation on enzyme stability and catalytic properties in microbial expression systems. PeHNL from leaves (PeHNL-N) and that expressed in P. pastoris (PeHNL-P) were glycosylated, whereas that expressed in E. coli (PeHNL-E) was not. The enzymes PeHNL-N and PeHNL-P showed much better thermostability, pH stability, and organic solvent tolerance than the deglycosylated enzyme PeHNL-E and the deglycosylated mutant N105Q from P. pastoris (PeHNL-P-N105Q). The glycosylated PeHNL-P also efficiently performed transcyanation of (R)-mandelonitrile with a 98 % enantiomeric excess in a biphasic system with diisopropyl ether. These data demonstrate the efficacy of these methods for improving enzyme expression and stability for industrial application through N-glycosylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as a chassis organism for polyketide synthesis via the full citrinin biosynthetic pathway.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, we tested the potential of the industrial methylotrophic yeast strain Pichia pastoris for the heterologous synthesis of polyketides. A recombinant P. pastoris GS-pksCT-npgA carrying the Monascus purpureus citrinin polyketide synthase gene pksCT and the Aspergillus nidulans phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene npgA was constructed. Subsequently, a specific compound was isolated and identified as citrinin intermediate trimethylated pentaketide aldehyde. On account of the hypothetic functions of the genes in the citrinin gene cluster, mpl1 encoding serine hydrolase, mpl2 encoding oxygenase, and mpl4 encoding dehydrogenase were gradually expressed. Proteins were also normally expressed, but a new compound was undetected. Basing on the recently reported citrinin gene cluster in Monascus ruber, we obtained two other genes (mpl6 and mpl7) participating in citrinin biosynthesis by genome walking in M. purpureus. Then, we co-transformed intron-removed mpl6 and mpl7 into the P. pastoris strain carrying pksCT, npgA, mpl1, mpl2, and mpl4. All genes were activated by the methanol-induced AOX1 promoter, and a complete biosynthetic pathway of citrinin was assembled. Finally, citrinin was successfully produced under methanol induction in P. pastoris. These results prove that P. pastoris is a promising chassis organism for polyketide production.</p></details><hr><h4>Recent advances of molecular toolbox construction expand Pichia pastoris in synthetic biology applications.</h4><p>Z.

In this mini-review, we addressed recent advances of molecular toolboxes, including synthetic promoters, signal peptides, and genome engineering tools that established for P. pastoris.

Here, 26 genes encoding beta-defensin-like peptides have been identified for the first time in Pelodiscus sinensis using database mining approach. Phylogenetic study confirmed that beta-defensins are fast evolving genes with high rates of sequence substitutions. The expression level of several selected genes in different tissues was examined by RT-PCR. Ps-BDs mainly adopt beta-strands and/or alpha-helix conformations homology modeled by Rosetta program. Further, Ps-BD2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using Ni-NTA column and RT-HPLC. As expected, the rPs-BD2 showed strong antimicrobial activity, but displayed a negligible hemolytic and cytotoxic activity on human erythrocytes and Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cells, respectively. Our results suggested that the Ps-BD2 was produced efficiently in P. pastoris expression system, which makes the large-scale use of rPs-BDs possible in the future clinical practice.</p></details><hr><h4>Catalytic efficiency and thermostability improvement of Suc2 invertase through rational site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>N. Mohandesi et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 96 14 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871374>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Engineering of invertases has come to attention because of increasing demand for possible applications of invertases in various industrial processes. Due to the known physicochemical properties, invertases from micro-organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying SUC2 gene are considered as primary models. To improve thermostability and catalytic efficiency of SUC2 invertase (SInv), six influential residues with Relative Solvent Accessibility<5% were selected through multiple-sequence alignments, molecular modelling, structural and computational analyses. Consequently, SInv and 5 mutants including three mutants with single point substitution [Mut1=P152V, Mut2=S85V and Mut3=K153F)], one mutant with two points [Mut4=S305V-N463V] and one mutant with three points [Mut5=S85V-K153F-T271V] were developed via site-directed mutagenesis and produced using Pichia pastoris as the host. Physicochemical studies on these enzymes indicated that the selected amino acids which were located in the active site region mainly influenced catalytic efficiency. The best improvement belonged to Mut1 (54% increase in Kcat/Km) and Mut3 exhibited the worst effect (90% increase in Km). These results suggest that Pro152 and Lys153 play key role in preparation of the right substrate lodging in the active site of SInv. The best thermostability improvement (16%) was observed for Mut4 in which two hydrophilic residues located on the loops, far from the active site, were replaced by Valines. These results suggest that tactful simultaneous substitution of influential hydrophilic residues in both active site region and peripheral loops with hydrophobic amino acids could result in more thermostable invertases with enhanced catalytic efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient production of recombinant glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus type 2 in Pichia pastoris and its protective efficacy against viral challenge in mice.</h4><p>M. Wang et al., Arch Virol 162 701 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27868164>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is the leading cause of genital ulcer disease and a significant public health concern. However, there are no approved vaccines available to prevent HSV-2 infection. The glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-2 is the most important candidate antigen for vaccine development. In this study, a truncated form of gD (codons 1-340, gD1-340) was produced as a secretory protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant gD1-340 with a His6 tag was purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography. Mice immunized with the recombinant gD1-340 developed high levels of antigen-specific antibody responses with HSV-2 neutralizing activity. Immunization with the recombinant gD1-340 conferred significant protection against lethal HSV-2 infection in mice. Moreover, measurement of the secretion of gD1-340-specific cytokines demonstrated that the recombinant gD1-340 induced mixed Th1/Th2 cellular immune responses. These findings indicated that P. pastoris-derived gD1-340 represents a promising HSV-2 vaccine candidate with strong immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of the plant cysteine protease bromelain and its inhibitor in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>N.

On the other hand, proteases are broadly used in industrial applications and resemble promising drug candidates. Bromelain is an herbal drug that is medicinally used for treatment of oedematous swellings and inflammatory conditions and consists in large part of proteolytic enzymes. Even though various experiments underline the requirement of active cysteine proteases for biological activity, so far no investigation succeeded to clearly clarify the pharmacological mode of action of bromelain. The potential role of proteases themselves and other molecules of this multi-component extract currently remain largely unknown or ill defined. Here, we set out to express several bromelain cysteine proteases as well as a bromelain inhibitor molecule in order to gain defined molecular entities for subsequent studies. After cloning the genes from its natural source Ananas comosus (pineapple plant) into Pichia pastoris and subsequent fermentation and purification, we obtained active protease and inhibitor molecules which were subsequently biochemically characterized. Employing purified bromelain fractions paves the way for further elucidation of pharmacological activities of this natural product. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The two (His)6-tagged proteins were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography and obtained in quantities of 12 and 15 mg L-1 of culture volume, respectively. Glycosylation sites were identified for the native and for the enzymatically deglycosylated proteins by mass spectrometry, confirming five to six of the seven predicted glycosylation sites in the NxS/T sequence context. The predominant glycan structure was Man5GlcNAc2 with, however, a significant contribution of Man4-10GlcNAc2. Both dirigent proteins (DIRs) mediated the formation of (+)-gossypol by atropselective coupling of hemigossypol radicals. Similar to previously characterized DIRs, GbDIR2 and GhDIR3 lacked oxidizing activity and depended on an oxidizing system (laccase/O2) for the generation of substrate radicals. In contrast to DIRs involved in the biosynthesis of lignans, glycosylation was not essential for function. Quantitative enzymatic deglycosylation yielded active GbDIR2 and GhDIR3 in excellent purity. The described fermentation process in combination with enzymatic deglycosylation will pave the way for mechanistic and structural studies and, eventually, the application of cotton DIRs in a biomimetic approach towards atropselective biaryl synthesis.</p></details><hr><h4>Species Differences in Human and Rodent PEPT2-Mediated Transport of Glycylsarcosine and Cefadroxil in Pichia Pastoris Transformants.</h4><p>F.

However, unlike PEPT1 (SLC15A1), there is little information about species differences in the transport of PEPT2-mediated substrates. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PEPT2 exhibited a species-dependent uptake of glycylsarcosine (GlySar) and cefadroxil using yeast Pichia pastoris cells expressing cDNA from human, mouse, and rat. In such a system, the functional activity of PEPT2 was evaluated with [3H]GlySar as a function of time, pH, substrate concentration, and specificity, and with [3H]cefadroxil as a function of concentration. We observed that the uptake of GlySar was pH-dependent with an optimal uptake at pH 6.5 for all three species. Moreover, GlySar showed saturable uptake kinetics, with Km values in human (150.6 microM) > mouse (42.8 microM) approximately rat (36.0 microM). The PEPT2-mediated uptake of GlySar in yeast transformants was specific, being inhibited by di/tripeptides and peptide-like drugs, but not by amino acids and nonsubstrate compounds. Cefadroxil also showed a saturable uptake profile in all three species, with Km values in human (150.8 muM) > mouse (15.6 muM) approximately rat (11.9 muM). These findings demonstrated that the PEPT2-mediated uptake of GlySar and cefadroxil was specific, species dependent, and saturable. Furthermore, based on the Km values, mice appeared similar to rats but both were less than optimal as animal models in evaluating the renal reabsorption and pharmacokinetics of peptides and peptide-like drugs in humans.</p></details><hr><h4>Neutralization of TNFalpha in tumor with a novel nanobody potentiates paclitaxel-therapy and inhibits metastasis in breast cancer.</h4><p>X.

Researchers have suggested that inflammatory factors in the tumor environment can promote cancer invasion and metastasis, stimulating cancer progression. Thus, novel strategies that target cytokines and modulate the tumor microenvironment may emerge as important approaches for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specific neutralization of pathogenic TNF signaling using a TNFalpha antibody has gained increasing attention. Considering this, a selective human TNFalpha neutralized antibody was generated based on nanobody technology. A TNFalpha-specific nanobody was produced in Pichia pastoris with a molecular mass of 15 kDa and affinity constant of 2.05 nM. In the proliferation experiment, the TNFalpha nanobody could inhibit the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 induced by hTNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. In the microinvasion model, the TNFalpha nanobody could inhibit the migration of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 induced by hTNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. Drug administration of the combination of paclitaxel with the TNFalpha nanobody in vivo significantly enhanced the efficacy against 4T-1 breast tumor proliferation and lung metastasis; meanwhile, E-cadherin tumor epithelial marker expression was upregulated, supporting the anti-tumor therapeutic relevance of paclitaxel and the TNFalpha nanobody on EMT. This study highlights the importance of neutralizing low TNFalpha levels in the tumor microenvironment to sensitize the chemotherapeutic response, which has attractive potential for clinical applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of the fermentation and downstream processes for human enterokinase production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

In this study, several fermentation strategies were assayed for the production of human enterokinase in Pichia pastoris under constitutive GAP promoter. Two of them with controlled specific growth rate during whole cultivation showed a very low enterokinase activity, under 1 U/ml, of the fermentation medium. On the contrary, the combined fermentation with a maximum specific growth rate at the initial phase of the fermentation and stationary-like phase during the rest of the fermentation showed a significant accumulation of the enterokinase in the medium, which counted up to 1400 U/ml. Lower cultivation temperature had a negative impact on the enzyme accumulation during this fermentation strategy. Downstream processes were focused on buffer environment optimization directly after cultivation, as at this time, the most amount of the activity is eliminated by endogenous proteases. Slightly positive effect on enzyme activity in the medium had an addition of liquid storage solution of EDTA and KOH to adjust pH to 8 and molarity of the EDTA to 50 mM. During the purification process, a significant amount of the enzyme was detected to be lost, which counted up to 90%. The purified enzyme, enterokinase, kept quality standard of the published enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Dengue Virus 4 Envelope Glycoprotein Virus-Like Particles Derived from Pichia pastoris are Capable of Eliciting Homotypic Domain III-Directed Neutralizing Antibodies.</h4><p>N.

Reportedly, there has been a 2-fold increase in dengue cases every decade. An efficacious tetravalent vaccine, which can provide long-term immunity against all four serotypes in all target populations, is still unavailable. Despite the progress being made in the live virus-based dengue vaccines, the World Health Organization strongly recommends the development of alternative approaches for safe, affordable, and efficacious dengue vaccine candidates. We have explored virus-like particles (VLPs)-based nonreplicating subunit vaccine approach and have developed recombinant envelope ectodomains of DENV-1, 2, and 3 expressed in Pichia pastoris These self-assembled into VLPs without pre-membrane (prM) protein, which limits the generation of enhancing antibodies, and elicited type-specific neutralizing antibodies against the respective serotype. Encouraged by these results, we have extended this work further by developing P. pastoris-expressed DENV-4 ectodomain (DENV-4 E) in this study, which was found to be glycosylated and assembled into spherical VLPs without prM, and displayed critical neutralizing epitopes on its surface. These VLPs were found to be immunogenic in mice and elicited DENV-4-specific neutralizing antibodies, which were predominantly directed against envelope domain III, implicated in host-receptor recognition and virus entry. These observations underscore the potential of VLP-based nonreplicative vaccine approach as a means to develop a safe, efficacious, and tetravalent dengue subunit vaccine. This work paves the way for the evaluation of a DENV E-based tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, as an alternative to live virus-based dengue vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Is Pichia pastoris a realistic platform for industrial production of recombinant human interferon gamma?</h4><p>A.

Efficient expression of hIFNgamma has been reported once for Pichia pastoris (Wang et al., 2014) - a proven heterologous expression system. This study investigated hIFNgamma expression in P. pastoris replicating the previous study and expanding by using four different strains (X33: wild type; GS115: HIS-Mut+; KM71</p><p><strong>H:</strong> Arg+, Mut- and CBS7435: MutS) and three different vectors (pPICZalphaA, pPIC9 and pPpT4alphaS). In addition, the native sequence (NS) and two codon-optimised sequences (COS1 and COS2) for P. pastoris were used. Methanol induction yielded no expression/secretion of hIFNgamma in X33, highest levels were recorded for CBS7435: MutS ( approximately 16 mug. L-1). mRNA copy number calculations acquired from RT-qPCR for GS115-pPIC9-COS1 proved low abundance of mRNA. A 10-fold increase in expression of hIFNgamma was achieved by lowering the minimal free energy of the mRNA and 100-fold by MutS phenotypes, substantially lower than reported by Wang et al. (2014). We conclude that commercial production of low cost, eukaryotic recombinant hIFNgamma is not an economically viable in P. pastoris. Further research is required to unravel the cause of low expression in P. pastoris to achieve economic viability.</p></details><hr><h4>Peroxisome-targeted and tandem repeat multimer expressions of human antimicrobial peptide LL37 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

This study attempted two strategies to alleviate its damage to host cells when expressed in Pichia pastoris using the AOX1 promoter. Tandem repeat multimers of LL37 were first designed, and secretion expression strains GS115-9K-(DPLL37DP)n (n = 2, 4, 6 and 8) containing different copies of the LL37 gene were constructed. However, LL37 tandems still killed the cells after 96 hr of induction. Subsequently, peroxisome-targeted expression was performed by adding a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (SKL) at the C-terminus of LL37. The LL37 expression strain GS115-3.5K-LL37-SKL showed no significant inhibition in the cells after induction. Antibacterial activity assays showed that the recombinant LL37 expressed in peroxisomes had good antimicrobial activities. Then, a strain GS115-3.5K-LL37-GFP-SKL producing LL37, green fluorescent protein, and SKL fusion proteins was constructed, and the fusion protein was confirmed to be targeting the peroxisomes. However, protein extraction analysis indicated that most of the fusion proteins were still located in the cell debris after cell disruption, and further studies are required to extract more proteins from the peroxisome membrane.</p></details><hr><h4>Overcoming difficulties on synthesis of cardiac troponin-I.</h4><p>S.

To produce the protein efficiently, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris systems were used. Initial trials for the expression in E. coli were not successful, although different expression vectors with different promoters were tested. This led us to use P. pastoris for the expression. After several trials with two different expression strains of P. pastoris, it was concluded that P. pastoris was also not an optimal expression host for cTnI. Comprehensive analysis of the expression systems indicated that an efficient expression is only possible when the gene is optimized for expression in E. coli. For this purpose, the gene was optimized in-silico, but edited manually afterwards. It was synthesized and cloned into pQE-2 vector. Expression was performed using routine experimental conditions. Thus, cTnI could be efficiently expressed from the optimized gene in E. coli. The expression and purification were practical and may be used for commercial purposes since a total yield of 25microg highly pure protein per milliliter of culture could be obtained. The protein was in its ready-to-use form for many biological applications, including as a standard in diagnostic tests and an antigen for antibody production.</p></details><hr><h4>Regulating unfolded protein response activator HAC1p for production of thermostable raw-starch hydrolyzing alpha-amylase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Here, we evaluated the effects of the UPR activator HAC1p on a raw-starch hydrolyzing alpha-amylase (Gs4j-amyA), so as to improve heterologous production of the enzyme in Pichia pastoris. The gene (amyA) encoding Gs4j-amyA was first codon-optimized and expressed in P. pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. A high gene dosage (12 copies) of amyA facilitated amylase expression which produced an enzyme activity of 305 U/ml. A spliced HAC1 encoding an UPR activator HAC1p was then co-expressed and the dosage effects of HAC1 on amylase expression was investigated. Six copies of HAC1 driven by AOX1 promoter produced a high amylase activity of 2200 U/ml, further increasing by 621%. However, excessive gene dosages driven by the same promoter led to a titration effect of its transcription factors and decreased the amount of amyA transcripts. Thus, constitutive expression of HAC1 by GAP promotor was further involved and Gs4j-amyA activity reached 3700 U/ml finally, which was further increased by 68.2%. Moreover, Gs4j-amyA was glycosylated in P. pastoris which generated higher enzyme activity than that in E. coli. Generally, regulating HAC1p expression by different strategies enhanced amylase production by 11.1 folds, indicating a reference for expression of other proteins in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant exochitinase of the thermophilic mould Myceliopthora thermophila BJA: Characteristics and utility in generating N-acetyl glucosamine and in biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi.</h4><p>A.

To produce high enzyme titres, reduce fermentation time and overcome the need for induction, this enzyme has been heterologously expressed under GAP promoter in the GRAS yeast, Pichia pastoris. The production medium supplemented with the permeabilizing agent Tween-20 supported two-fold higher rMtChit production (5.5 x 103 U L-1 ). The consensus sequences S(132)xG(133)G(134) and D(168)xxD(171)xD(173)xE(175) in the enzyme have been found to represent the substrate binding and catalytic sites, respectively. The rMtChit, purified to homogeneity by a two-step purification strategy, is a monomeric glycoprotein of approximately 48 kDa, which is optimally active at 55 degrees C and pH 5.0. The enzyme is thermostable with t1/2 values of 113 and 48 min at 65 and 75 degrees C, respectively. Kinetic parameters Km , Vmax , kcat , and kcat /Km of the enzyme are 4.655 mg mL-1 , 34.246 nmol mg-1 s-1 , 3.425 x 106 min-1 , and 1.36 x 10-6 mg mL-1 min-1 , respectively. rMtChit is an unique exochitinase, since its action on chitin liberates N-acetylglucosamine NAG. The enzyme inhibits the growth of phytopathogenic fungi like Fusarium oxysporum and Curvularia lunata, therefore, this finds application as biofungicide at high temperatures during summer in tropics.

To check the influence of the expression on interfacial properties of FSL and to study kinetic properties of FSL2, interfacial parameters of FSL2, native FSL, untagged recombinant and tagged recombinant forms of FSL were compared using the monomolecular film technique. Kinetic study on the dependence of the stereoselectivity of these lipases on the surface pressure was performed using three dicaprin isomers spread in the form of monomolecular films at the air-water interface. The FSL2 seems to have an important penetration power with a preference for adjacent ester groups and the heterologous expression accompanied or not with the N-His-tag extension on the FSL were found to modify the pressure preference and increase the catalytic hydrolysis rate of three dicaprin isomers. The heterologous expression was found to preserve the FSL regioselectivity without affecting its stereospecificity at high and low surface pressure. The evaluation of the recombinant expression Effects on Catalysis (REC), the N-Tag Effects on Catalysis (TEC), and the N-Tag and Recombinant expression Effects on Catalysis (TREC) showed that the heterologous expression was more efficient than the presence of the N-terminal tag extension on the FSL.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression, purification and antimicrobial activity of a novel antimicrobial peptide PaDef in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

In this study, an N-terminal 6 x His tagged recombinant PaDef (rPaDef) with a molecular weight of 7.5 KDa, for the first time, was expressed as a secreted peptide in Pichia pastoris. The optimal culture condition for rPaDef expression was determined to be incubation with 1.5% methanol for 72 h at 28 degrees C under pH 6.0. Under this condition, the amount of the rPaDef accumulation reached as high as 79.6 mug per 1 ml of culture medium. Once the rPaDef peptide was purified to reach a 95.7% purity using one-step nickel affinity chromatography, its strong and concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity was detected to be against a broad-spectrum of bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The growth of these bacterial pathogens was almost completely inhibited when the rPaDef peptide was at a concentration of as low as 90 mug/ml. In summary, our data showed that rPaDef derived from Mexican avocado fruit can be expressed and secreted efficiently when P. pastoris was used as a cell factory. This is the first report on heterologous expression of PaDef in P. pastoris and the approach described holds great promise for antibacterial drug development.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioprocess for the production of recombinant HAP phytase of the thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile and its structural and biochemical characteristics.</h4><p>A.

Low extracellular phytase production by the mold is a major bottleneck for its application on a commercial scale. We have successfully overcome this problem by constitutive secretary expression of codon optimized rStPhy under glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter in Pichia pastoris. A approximately 41-fold improvement in rStPhy production has been achieved. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra revealed that rStPhy is composed of 26.65% alpha-helices, 5.26% beta-sheets and 68.09% random coils at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C, the optima for the enzyme activity. The melting temperature (Tm) of the enzyme is approximately 73 degrees C. The 3D structure of rStPhy displayed characteristic signature sequences (RHGXRXP and HD) of HAP phytase. The catalytically important amino acids (Arg74, His75, Arg78, His368 and Asp369) were identified by docking and site directed mutagenesis. Fluorescence quenching by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CsCl exposed tryptophan residues surrounded by negative charges, which play a key role in maintaining structural integrity of rStPhy.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory expression of bovine herpesvirus type 1/5 glycoprotein E in Pichia pastoris for the differential diagnosis of vaccinated or infected cattle.</h4><p>B.

The rgE was identified by Western blotting (WB) using sera from cattle naturally infected with BoHV-1 and/or BoHV-5, or sera from bovines experimentally infected with wild-type BoHV-5. Sera collected from cattle vaccinated with a BoHV-5 gI/gE/US9 marker vaccine failed to recognise rgE.

Based on sequence similarity with other fungal lipases, FSL2 contains a catalytic triad, consisting of Ser144, Asp198, and His256. FSL2 cDNA was subcloned into the pGAPZalphaA vector containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor signal sequence and this construct was used to transform Pichia pastoris and achieve a high-level extracellular production of a FSL2 lipase. Maximum lipase activity was observed after 48h. The optimum activity of the purified recombinant enzyme was measured at pH 8.0-9.0 and 37 degrees C. FSL2 is remarkably stable at alkaline pH values up to 12 and at temperatures below 40 degrees C. It has high catalytic efficiency towards triglycerides with short to long chain fatty acids but with a marked preference for medium and long chain fatty acids. FSL2 activity is decreased at sodium taurodeoxycholate concentrations above the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of this anionic detergent. However, lipase activity is enhanced by Ca2+ and inhibited by EDTA or Cu2+ and partially by Mg2+ or K+. In silico docking of medium chain triglycerides, monogalctolipids (MGDG), digalactolipids (DGDG) and long chain phospholipids in the active site of FSL2 reveals structural solutions.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering a family 27 carbohydrate-binding module into an Aspergillus usamii beta-mannanase to perfect its enzymatic properties.</h4><p>J.

The temperature optimum of reAuMan5A-R-M was 70 degrees C, identical with that of reAuMan5A, while its thermostability and melting temperature (Tm) reached 68 degrees C and 74.9 degrees C, being 8.0 degrees C and 8.4 degrees C higher than those of the latter, respectively. Additionally, the Km values of reAuMan5A-R-M, towards locust bean gum, konjac gum and guar gum, significantly decreased to 0.9, 1.9 and 2.5 mg/mL from 1.7, 3.8 and 4.2 mg/mL of reAuMan5A, while its kcat/Km (catalytic efficiency) values increased to 287.8, 163.7 and 84.4 mL/mgs from 171.2, 97.6 and 56.0 mL/mgs of the latter, respectively. These results verified that the fusion of a TmCBM27 into the C-terminus of AuMan5A mediated by (EAAAK)3 linker contributed to its improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Cross-Linking and Bundling of Self-Assembled Protein-Based Polymer Fibrils via Heterodimeric Coiled Coils.</h4><p>N.

We here demonstrate that the structure of these hydrogels can be tuned via heterodimeric coiled coils that cross-link and bundle the self-assembled protein polymer fibrils. We fused well-characterized, 47 amino acids-long heterodimeric coiled coil "linkers" (DA or DB) to the C-terminus of the triblock polymer. The resulting C2-SH48-C2-DA and C2-SH48-C2-DB polymers, were successfully produced as secreted proteins in Pichia pastoris, with titers of purified protein in the order of g L-1 of clarified broth. Atomic force microscopy showed that fibrils formed by either C2-SH48-C2-DA or C2-SH48-C2-DB alone already displayed extensive bundling, apparently as a result of homotypic (DA/DA and DB/DB) interactions. For fibrils prepared from protein polymers having no linkers, plus a small fraction of polymers containing either DA or DB linkers, no cross-linking and bundling was observed. At these same low concentrations of linkers, fibrils containing both the DA and the DB linkers did show cross-linking and bundling as a consequence of heterodimer formation. This work shows that we can control the extent of bundling and cross-linking of supramolecular fibrils by varying the density of heterodimerizing coiled coils in the fibrils, which is promising for the further development of materials that mimic the extracellular matrix.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving thermal hysteresis activity of antifreeze protein from recombinant Pichia pastoris by removal of N-glycosylation.</h4><p>E.

These IBPs prevent the formation of large intracellular ice crystals, which may be fatal to the organism. Recently, a recombinant FfIBP (an IBP from Flavobacterium frigoris PS1) was cloned and produced in Pichia pastoris using fed-batch fermentation with methanol feeding. In this study, we demonstrate that FfIBP produced by P. pastoris has a glycosylation site, which diminishes the thermal hysteresis activity of FfIBP. The FfIBP expressed by P. pastoris exhibited a doublet on SDS-PAGE. The results of a glycosidase reaction suggested that FfIBP possesses complex N-linked oligosaccharides. These results indicate that the residues of the glycosylated site could disturb the binding of FfIBP to ice molecules. The findings of this study could be utilized to produce highly active antifreeze proteins on a large scale.</p></details><hr><h4>AoAtg26, a putative sterol glucosyltransferase, is required for autophagic degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>T.

In filamentous fungi, autophagic degradation of organelles such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei occurs in basal cells after the prolonged culture, but its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we functionally analyzed the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae AoAtg26, an ortholog of the sterol glucosyltransferase PpAtg26 involved in pexophagy in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Deletion of Aoatg26 caused a severe decrease in conidiation and aerial hyphae formation, which is typically observed in the autophagy-deficient A. oryzae strains. In addition, cup-shaped AoAtg8-positive membrane structures were accumulated in the Aoatg26 deletion strain, indicating that autophagic process is impaired. Indeed, the Aoatg26 deletion strain was defective in the degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei. Taken together, AoAtg26 plays an important role for autophagic degradation of organelles in A. oryzae, which may physiologically contribute to the differentiation in filamentous fungi.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of l-glutamate oxidase in Pichia pastoris using multi-copy expression strains and high cell density cultivation.</h4><p>W. YaPing et al., Protein Expr Purif 129 108 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27693490>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>l-glutamate oxidase (GLOD), encoded by the gox gene, catalyses the transformation of l-glutamic acid into alpha-ketoglutaric acid (alpha-KG). In the present study, Pichia pastoris was used for heterologous production of GLOD following optimization of the gox coding sequence for expression in the yeast host. A series of constructs based on the pHBM905BDM plasmid were engineered and transformed into P. pastoris to increase the gox copy number. The results indicated that GLOD protein levels and enzyme activity increased with increasing gox copy number. Strain PGLOD4, which contained four copies of the target gene, was chosen for subsequent fermentation experiments, and a fermentation strategy involving two exponential feeding phases was developed. During the preinduction phase, glycerol was fed exponentially at muG = 0.15/h. When the cell density reached 300 g/l, methanol was fed exponentially at muM = 0.03/h to induce GLOD production. After 84 h of cultivation, the final cell density and total enzyme activity reached 420 g/L and 247.8 U/mL, respectively. The recombinant enzyme displayed an optimum temperature of 40 degrees C, which was higher than recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli. This is important because increasing the temperature could accelerate enzymatic transformation of l-glutamic acid to alpha-KG. Experiments also demonstrated superior thermo-stability for the enzyme produced in yeast, which further enhances its potential for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Rapid and ultrasensitive detection of active thrombin based on the Vmh2 hydrophobin fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein.</h4><p>A. Piscitelli et al., Biosens Bioelectron 87 816 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27657843>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A fusion protein designed in order to combine the fluorescence emission of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) with the adhesion ability of the class I hydrophobin Vmh2 was heterologously produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The Vmh2-GFP fusion protein has proven to be a smart and effective tool for the study of Vmh2 self-assembling. Since the two proteins were linked by the specific cutting site of the thrombin, the fusion protein was used as the active biological element in the realization of a thrombin biosensor. When the thrombin present in the target solution specifically hydrolyzed its cleavage sequence, a consequent decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the sample could be observed. The Vmh2-GFP based assay allowed quantification of thrombin in solution with a detection limit of 2.27aM. The specificity of the assay with respect to other proteases and proteins granted the measurement of thrombin added to healthy human plasma with same high sensitivity and a limit of detection of 2.3aM. Further advantages of the developed biosensor are the simplicity of its design and preparation, and the low requirements in terms of samples, reagents and time.</p></details><hr><h4>The Y54(L)W mutation of anti-leukotriene C4 single-chain antibody increases affinity to leukotriene E4.</h4><p>Y.

To elucidate the individual contribution of Tyr-54 and Asn-58 in the light chain of mAbLTC, both of which formed a hydrogen bond with glutamic acid of LTC4, we examined whether substitution of the residues affects the antigen binding affinity and specificity using an anti-LTC4 single chain variable fragment (scFvLTC). Among the Tyr-54(L) mutants, Y54(L)W showed a dramatic increase in the affinity to LTE4 which was comparable to that to LTD4 Essentially the same results were obtained using the Y54(L)W mutant expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. The structural modeling suggested the formation of a novel hydrogen bond between the substituted tryptophan in the antibody and the cysteine residue in LTE4 The affinity of Y54(L)R, Y54(L)E and Y54(L)L to LTC4 was markedly reduced, whereas other tested Tyr-54(L) mutants as well as Asn-58(L) mutants did not show significant change in LT binding. The results may provide an insight into the molecular basis of specific LT recognition by the antibody.</p></details><hr><h4>The sequence variation and functional differentiation of CRDs in a scallop multiple CRDs containing lectin.</h4><p>M. Huang et al., Dev Comp Immunol 67 333 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27592049>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A C-type lectin of multiple CRDs (CfLec-4) from Chlamys farreri was selected to investigate the sequence variation and functional differentiation of its CRDs. Its four CRDs with EPD/LSD, EPN/FAD, EPN/LND and EPN/YND key motifs were recombined separately. The recombinant proteins of CRD1 and CRD2 (designated as rCRD1 and rCRD2) could bind LPS and mannan, while the recombinant proteins of CRD3 and CRD4 (designated as rCRD3 and rCRD4) could bind LPS, PGN, mannan and glucan. Moreover, rCRD3 displayed broad microbe binding spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum, as well as fungi Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica. These results indicated CRD3 contributed more to CfLec-4's nonself-recognition ability. Furthermore, CRD1, CRD3 and CRD4 functioned as opsonin participating in the clearance against invaders in scallops. The sequence variation in Ca2+ binding site 2 among CRDs was suspected to be associated with such functional differentiation.</p></details><hr><h4>Psc-AFP from Psoralea corylifolia L. overexpressed in Pichia pastoris increases antimicrobial activity and enhances disease resistance of transgenic tobacco.</h4><p>X.

Its encoding gene was cloned by 3'- rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) combined with Y-shaped adaptor-dependent extension (YADE) method. The gene Psc-AFP encodes a protein of 203 amino acids with a deduced signal peptide of 24 residues. The growth inhibition effect exerted by the heterologously expressed Psc-AFP in Pichia pastoris revealed that the recombinant Psc-AFP inhibited mycelium growth of Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, and Alternaria brassicae and conidial germination of Alternaria alternata. The recombinant Psc-AFP also showed protease inhibitor activity manifested by the inhibition of trypsin. The transgenic tobacco bioassays confirmed that overexpressing Psc-AFP significantly enhanced the disease resistance of tobacco and that some of the transgenic lines were almost fully tolerant to Ralstonia solanacearum and A. alternata, whereas no apparent alteration in plant growth and development was observed. Collectively, these results indicate that the recombinant Psc-AFP is an active antimicrobial protein, with protease inhibitor activity that can be successfully produced in the yeast and tobacco and, therefore, maybe a potential antimicrobial candidate for practical use.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and characterization of thermostable glucose dehydrogenases from thermophilic filamentous fungi.</h4><p>K.

In order to obtain a novel FAD-GDH gene homolog, we performed degenerate PCR screening of genomic DNAs from 17 species of thermophilic filamentous fungi. Two FAD-GDH gene homologs were identified and cloned from Talaromyces emersonii NBRC 31232 and Thermoascus crustaceus NBRC 9129. We then prepared the recombinant enzymes produced by Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Absorption spectra and enzymatic assays revealed that the resulting enzymes contained oxidized FAD as a cofactor and exhibited glucose dehydrogenase activity. The transition midpoint temperatures (T m) were 66.4 and 62.5 degrees C for glycosylated FAD-GDHs of T. emersonii and T. crustaceus prepared by using P. pastoris as a host, respectively. Therefore, both FAD-GDHs exhibited high thermostability. In conclusion, we propose that these thermostable FAD-GDHs could be ideal enzymes for use as thermotolerant glucose sensors with high accuracy.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant overexpression of camel hepcidin cDNA in Pichia pastoris: purification and characterization of the polyHis-tagged peptide HepcD-His.</h4><p>M.

The aim of this work was the expression, as secreted peptide, purification, and characterization of a new recombinant polyHis-tagged camel hepcidin (HepcD-His) in yeast Pichia pastoris. The use of this eukaryotic expression system, for the production of HepcD-His, having 6 histidine residues at its C terminus, was simpler and more efficient compared with the use of the prokaryotic system Escherichia coli. Indeed, a single purification step was required to isolate the soluble hepcidin with purity estimated more that 94% and a yield of 2.8 against 0.2 mg/L for the E coli system. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry of the purified HepcD-His showed 2 major peaks at m/z 4524.64 and 4634.56 corresponding to camel hepcidin with 39 and 40 amino acids. Evaluation of disulfide bond connectivity with the Ellman method showed an absence of free thiol groups, testifying that the 8 cysteine residues in the peptide are displayed, forming 4 disulfide bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that camel hepcidin structure was significantly modified at high temperature of 90 degrees C and returns to its original structure when incubation temperature drops back to 20 degrees C. Interestingly, this peptide showed also a greater bactericidal activity, at low concentration of 9.5muM, against E coli, than the synthetic analog DH3. Thus, the production, at a large scale, of the recombinant camel hepcidin, HepcD-His, may be helpful for future therapeutic applications including bacterial infection diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative thermal inactivation analysis of Aspergillus oryzae and Thiellavia terrestris cutinase: Role of glycosylation.</h4><p>A. N. Shirke et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 114 63 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27425027>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cutinase thermostability is important so that the enzymes can function above the glass transition of what are often rigid polymer substrates. A detailed thermal inactivation analysis was performed for two well-characterized cutinases, Aspergillus oryzae Cutinase (AoC) and Thiellavia terrestris Cutinase (TtC). Both AoC and TtC are prone to thermal aggregation upon unfolding at high temperature, which was found to be a major reason for irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Our study demonstrates that glycosylation stabilizes TtC expressed in Pichia pastoris by inhibiting its thermal aggregation. Based on the comparative thermal inactivation analyses of non-glycosylated AoC, glycosylated (TtC-G), and non-glycosylated TtC (TtC-NG), a unified model for thermal inactivation is proposed that accounts for thermal aggregation and may be applicable to other cutinase homologues. Inspired by glycosylated TtC, we successfully employed glycosylation site engineering to inhibit AoC thermal aggregation. Indeed, the inhibition of thermal aggregation by AoC glycosylation was greater than that achieved by conventional use of trehalose under a typical condition. Collectively, this study demonstrates the excellent potential of implementing glycosylation site engineering for thermal aggregation inhibition, which is one of the most common reasons for the irreversible thermal inactivation of cutinases and many proteins.

A peptide epitope from human papillomavirus (HPV) minor capsid protein L2 displayed on thioredoxin (Trx) has been validated preclinically as a broadly protective and low-cost alternative HPV vaccine. Focusing on thioredoxin from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrx) as a scaffold, we have constructed a modified Pichia pastoris expression vector and used a PfTrx fusion derivative containing three tandemly repeated copies of a 19 amino acids peptide epitope from HPV-L2 for expression optimization and biochemical-immunological characterization of the Pichia-produced PfTrx-L2 antigen. We show that PfTrx-L2 is produced at high levels (up to 100 mg from a 100 ml starting culture using a multi-cycle induction protocol) and secreted into the culture medium as a highly enriched (>70% pure), non-glycosylated polypeptide that can be purified to homogeneity in a single step. Oxidation and aggregation state, thermal stability and immunogenicity of the endotoxin-free PfTrx-L2 antigen produced in P. pastoris were tested and found to be identical to those of the same antigen produced in Escherichia coli. Secretory production of endotoxin-free PfTrx-peptides in P. pastoris represents a cost- and time-effective alternative to E. coli production. Specifically designed for peptide antigens, the PfTrx-expression vector and conditions described herein are easily transferable to a variety of applications centred on the use of structurally constrained bioactive peptides as immune as well as target-specific binder reagents.</p></details><hr><h4>In-vitro and in-vivo biological activity of recombinant yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) follicle stimulating hormone.</h4><p>P.

They compare favorably to immobilized lipase and chemically catalyzed processes. Genetically modified whole-cell lipase-mediated in vitro route, together with in vivo and ex vivo microbial biosynthesis routes, constitutes emerging and rapidly developing research areas for effective production of biodiesel. This review presents recent advances in customizing microorganisms for producing biodiesel, via genetic engineering of lipases and metabolic engineering (including system regulation) of fatty-acids-derived pathways. Microbial hosts used include Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris and Aspergillus oryzae. These microbial cells can be genetically modified to produce lipases under different forms: intracellularly expressed, secreted or surface-displayed. They can be metabolically redesigned and systematically regulated to obtain balanced biodiesel-producing cells, as highlighted in this study. Such genetically or metabolically modified microbial cells can support not only in vitro biotransformation of various common oil feedstocks to biodiesel, but also de novo biosynthesis of biodiesel from glucose, glycerol or even cellulosic biomass. We believe that the genetically tractable oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica could be developed to an effective biodiesel-producing microbial cell factory. For this purpose, we propose several engineered pathways, based on lipase and wax ester synthase, in this promising oleaginous host.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering of Harobin for enhanced fibrinolytic activity obtained by random and site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>Z. Li et al., Protein Expr Purif 129 162 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363113>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We have previously published a report on the cloning and characterization of Harobin, a fibrinolytic serine protease. However, the broad application of this fibrinolytic enzyme is limited by its low expression level that was achieved in Pichia pastoris. To counteract this shortcoming, random and site-directed mutagenesis have been combined in order to improve functional expression and activity of Harobin. By screening 400 clones from random mutant libraries for enhanced fibrinolytic activity, two mutants were obtained: N111R, R230G. By performing site-directed mutagenesis, a Harobin double mutant, N111R/R230G, was constructed and can be functionally expressed at higher level than the wild type enzyme. In addition, it possessed much higher fibrinolytic and amidolytic activity than the wild type enzyme and other single mutants. The N111R/R230G expressed in basal salts medium was purified by a three step purification procedure. At pH of 6.0-9.0, and the temperature range of 40-90 degrees C, N111R/R230G was more active and more heat resistant. The fibrinolytic activities of Harobin mutants were completely inhibited by PMSF and SBTI, but not by EDTA, EGTA, DTT, indicating that Harobin is a serine protease. N111R/R230G showed much better anti-thrombosis effect than wild type Harobin and single mutants, and could significantly increase bleeding and clotting time. Intravenous injection of N111R/R230G in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p < 0.01), while heart rate (HR) was not affected. The in vitro and in vivo results of the present study revealed that Harobin double mutant N111R/R230G is an appropriate candidate for biotechnological applications due to its high expression level and high activity in area of thrombosis and hypertension.</p></details>
