HBscFv and IFNgamma were connected into HBscFv-IFNgamma by the linker (Gly4Ser)3, and then the multicopy recombinant plasmids pPICZalphaA/(HBscFv-IFNgamma)1,2,4 were constructed and transformed into Komagatella (Pichia) pastoris X33. The engineering strain X4, which had much higher copy number and could secretively express HBscFv-IFNgamma, was screened from transformed X33 by qPCR. Results from SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and ELISA indicated that HBscFv-IFNgamma displayed an excellent immunoreaction against HBsAg. The culture supernatant of X4 was purified by 14F7 affinity chromatography to obtain the fusion protein HBscFv-IFNgamma in a purity of 95-98%. The HBscFv-IFNgamma was able to bind 27.9% HBsAg in the serum of HBV transgenic mice, showing that the antibody of HBscFv-IFNgamma has high binding affinity against HBsAg. The expressing of the recombinant HBscFv-IFNgamma in P. pastoris provides a promising and inexpensive diagnostic reagent for preventing HBV infection.</p></details><hr><h4>The expression and purification of the delta sleep-inducing peptide fused with protein transduction domain and human serum albumin in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

To further study the pharmacological effect of DSIP on insomnia, we designed a fusion protein containing N-terminal TAT-based transduction domain followed by human serum albumin and DSIP and designated this protein as PHD fusion protein. We expressed PHD fusion protein in Pichia pastoris, purified it to near homogeneity by three-step chromatography and performed bioactivity assay. The pharmacological activity of PHD fusion protein was studied using classic pentobarbital-induced sleep test in healthy mice. PHD fusion protein increased the hypnotic effects of pentobarbital by reducing sleep latency and prolonged sleep duration. The present study suggested PHD fusion protein could be a new drug candidate for insomnia.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of the production process and characterization of the yeast-expressed SARS-CoV recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD219-N1), a SARS vaccine candidate.</h4><p>W. H. Chen et al., J Pharm Sci   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28456726>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>From 2002 to 2003, a global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to five continents and caused 8,000 respiratory infections and 800 deaths. To ameliorate the effects of future outbreaks as well as to prepare for biodefense, a process for the production of a recombinant protein vaccine candidate is under development. Previously, we reported the 5-L scale expression and purification of a promising recombinant SARS vaccine candidate, RBD219-N1, the 218-amino acid residue receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus expressed in yeast- Pichia pastoris X-33. When adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, this protein elicited high neutralizing antibody titers and high RBD-specific antibody titers. However, the yield of RBD219-N1 (60 mg RBD219-N1 per liter of fermentation supernatant; 60 mg/L FS) still required improvement to reach our target of >100 mg/L FS. In this study, we optimized the 10 L scale production process and increased the fermentation yield 6-7-fold to 400 mg/L FS with purification recovery >50%. A panel of characterization tests indicated that the process is reproducible and that the purified, tag-free RBD219-N1 protein has high purity and a well-defined structure and is therefore a suitable candidate for production under cGMP and future Phase 1 clinical trials.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of three Camellia sinensis small heat shock protein genes confers temperature stress tolerance in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana.</h4><p>M.

Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are crucial for protecting plants against biotic and abiotic stresses, especially heat stress. However, knowledge concerning the functions of Camellia sinensis sHSP in heat and cold stresses remains poorly understood. In this study, three C. sinensis sHSP genes (i.e., CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8) were isolated and characterized using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technology. The CsHSPs expression levels in C. sinensis leaves were significantly up-regulated by heat and cold stresses. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8 belong to sHSP Classes I, II, and IV, respectively. Heterologous expression of the three CsHSP genes in Pichia pastoris cells enhanced heat and cold stress tolerance. When exposed to heat and cold treatments, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing CsHSP17.7, CsHSP18.1, and CsHSP21.8 had lower malondialdehyde contents, ion leakage, higher proline contents, and transcript levels of stress-related genes (e.g., AtPOD, AtAPX1, AtP5CS2, and AtProT1) compared with the control line. In addition, improved seed germination vigor was also observed in the CsHSP-overexpressing seeds under heat stress. Taken together, our results suggest that the three identified CsHSP genes play key roles in heat and cold tolerance.</p></details><hr><h4>Development of a novel anti-human aspartyl-(asparaginyl) beta-hydroxylase monoclonal antibody with diagnostic and therapeutic potential.</h4><p>T. Huyan et al., Oncol Lett 13 1539 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454288>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Human aspartyl-(asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (HAAH) has recently been the subject of several studies, as it was previously observed to be overexpressed in numerous types of carcinoma cells and tissues in patient tumor samples. HAAH has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis, indicating that it may be an important target and biomarker for tumor diagnosis and treatment. However, the immunological tools currently available for the study of this protein, including monoclonal antibodies, are limited, as is the present knowledge regarding the role of HAAH in tumor therapy and diagnosis. In the present study, a recombinant C-terminal domain of HAAH was expressed in Pichia pastoris and a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting HAAH (HAAH-C) was constructed. Immunofluorescence and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays were used to demonstrate the specificity and ADCC activity of this antibody. The results demonstrated that this anti-C-terminal HAAH mAB, in combination with an existing anti-N terminal HAAH mAb, exhibited a high response to native HAAH from carcinoma cell culture supernatant, as measured with a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This validated novel mAB-HAAH-C may prompt further studies into the underlying mechanisms of HAAH, and the exploration of its potential in tumor diagnosis and therapy.</p></details><hr><h4>The CsHSP17.2 molecular chaperone is essential for thermotolerance in Camellia sinensis.</h4><p>M. Wang et al., Sci Rep 7 1237 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450727>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play important roles in responses to heat stress. However, the functions of sHSPs in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) remain uncharacterized. A novel sHSP gene, designated CsHSP17.2, was isolated from tea plants. Subcellular localization analyses indicated that the CsHSP17.2 protein was present in the cytosol and the nucleus. CsHSP17.2 expression was significantly up-regulated by heat stress but was unaffected by low temperature. The CsHSP17.2 transcript levels increased following salt and polyethylene glycol 6000 treatments but decreased in the presence of abscisic acid. The molecular chaperone activity of CsHSP17.2 was demonstrated in vitro. Transgenic Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris expressing CsHSP17.2 exhibited enhanced thermotolerance. The transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited higher maximum photochemical efficiencies, greater soluble protein proline contents, higher germination rates and higher hypocotyl elongation length than the wild-type controls. The expression levels of several HS-responsive genes increased in transgenic A. thaliana plants. Additionally, the CsHSP17.2 promoter is highly responsive to high-temperature stress in A. thaliana. Our results suggest that CsHSP17.2 may act as a molecular chaperone to mediate heat tolerance by maintaining maximum photochemical efficiency and protein synthesis, enhancing the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and inducing the expression of HS-responsive genes.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of myasthenia gravis and their therapeutic implications.</h4><p>K. Noridomi et al., Elife 6  (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28440223>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a major target of autoantibodies in myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease that causes neuromuscular transmission dysfunction. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying MG have not been fully elucidated. Here, we present the crystal structure of the nAChR alpha1 subunit bound by the Fab fragment of mAb35, a reference monoclonal antibody that causes experimental MG and competes with ~65% of antibodies from MG patients. Our structures reveal for the first time the detailed molecular interactions between MG antibodies and a core region on nAChR alpha1. These structures suggest a major nAChR-binding mechanism shared by a large number of MG antibodies and the possibility to treat MG by blocking this binding mechanism. Structure-based modeling also provides insights into antibody-mediated nAChR cross-linking known to cause receptor degradation. Our studies establish a structural basis for further mechanistic studies and therapeutic development of MG.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and Identification of a Novel Steroid 11alpha-hydroxylase Gene from Absidia coerulea.</h4><p>R. Wang et al., J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28428022>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Steroid 11-hydroxylation by filamentous fungi is a major route for industrial scale production of key intermediates in the synthesis of steroid drugs. Although it is well established that enzymes involved in fungal hydroxylation of steroids are cytochrome P450s (CYP), few fungal steroid hydroxylase genes have been identified. In this study, we identified a novel 11alpha-hydroxylase gene CYP5311B1 from Absidia coerulea AS3.65 by a combination of transcriptome sequencing, Real-Time qRT-PCR and heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of CYP5311B1 is predicted to encode a CYP protein of 527 amino acids whose expression in Pichia cells was confirmed by western blot. In addition, the major hydroxylation product was characterized by HPLC and 2D NMR. CYP5311B1 was highly induced by steroid substrate at the transcriptional level. The cloning and identification of an 11alpha-hydroxylase gene from A. coerulea should aid in a better understanding of the structural basis underlying regio- and stereoselectivity, and substrate specificity of fungal steroid 11alpha-hydroxylases, thus facilitating the engineering of more efficient steroid hydroxylases for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient production of nanobodies against urease activity ofHelicobacter pylori in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

One of the therapeutic approaches is administration of antibody against H. pylori. The methylotrophic Pichia pastoris is a suitable host for expression of recombinant antibody fragments. The aims of this study were the expression and the evaluation of camelid nanobody in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</p><p><strong> MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> The camelid-derived heavy-chain antibody (nanobody) against the UreC subunit of urease from H. pylori was subcloned in the pPink-HC shuttle vector and transferred into Escherichia coli TOP10. After digestion and purification, the shuttle vector was transformed in the PichiaPink expression system. The expression was evaluated in an in vitro system.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The yield of the nanobody expressed in P. pastoris was estimated to be 5 mg/L as compared to 2 mg/L expressed by E. coli. The nanobody was purified and binding affinity to the UreC antigen was evaluated using ELISA. Neutralization abilities of the two nanobodies expressed in yeast and E. coli were compared. The yeast-expressed nanobody specifically detected recombinant UreC and inhibited urease activity with high efficiency.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The results suggest attribution of the enhanced quality and quantity of the nanobody produced in P. pastoris to better posttranslational modification and folding in the yeast cell.</p></details><hr><h4>Inhibition activity of a disulfide-stabilized diabody against basic fibroblast growth factor in lung cancer.</h4><p>Y. Cai et al., Oncotarget 8 20187 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423625>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The over-expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays a crucial role in the development, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. Therefore, neutralizing antibodies against bFGF may inhibit the growth of lung cancer. In this study, a Disulfide-stabilized diabody (ds-Diabody) against bFGF was constructed by site-directed mutation and overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) at the position of VH44 and VL100 in the scFv. The ds-Diabody was constructed and expressed in Pichia pastoris. We found that the ds-Diabody against bFGF could efficiently suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of human lung cancer A549 cells in vitro. Moreover, in A549 cells, the ds-Diabody against bFGF could inhibit bFGF-induced activation of downstream signaling regulators, such as phospho-Akt and phospho-MAPK. In the nude mouse xenograft model of lung cancer, the ds-Diabody against bFGF could significantly inhibit tumor growth and decrease the densities of micro-vessels and lymphatic vessels in tumor tissue. Our data indicate that the ds-Diabody against bFGF could effectively suppress the lung cancer growth through blockade of bFGF signaling pathway and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, which may make it a potential therapeutic candidate antibody drug for human lung cancer therapy.</p></details><hr><h4>Plackett-Burman Design for rGILCC1 Laccase Activity Enhancement in Pichia pastoris: Concentrated Enzyme Kinetic Characterization.</h4><p>E.

They are of great interest due to their potential biotechnological applications. In this work we statistically improved culture media for recombinant GILCC1 (rGILCC1) laccase production at low scale from Ganoderma lucidum containing the construct pGAPZalphaA-GlucPost-Stop in Pichia pastoris. Temperature, pH stability, and kinetic parameter characterizations were determined by monitoring concentrate enzyme oxidation at different ABTS substrate concentrations. Plackett-Burman Design allowed improving enzyme activity from previous work 36.08-fold, with a laccase activity of 4.69 +/- 0.39 UL-1 at 168 h of culture in a 500 mL shake-flask. Concentrated rGILCC1 remained stable between 10 and 50 degrees C and retained a residual enzymatic activity greater than 70% at 60 degrees C and 50% at 70 degrees C. In regard to pH stability, concentrated enzyme was more stable at pH 4.0 +/- 0.2 with a residual activity greater than 90%. The lowest residual activity greater than 55% was obtained at pH 10.0 +/- 0.2. Furthermore, calculated apparent enzyme kinetic parameters were a Vmax of 6.87 x 10-5 mM s-1, with an apparent Km of 5.36 x 10-2 mM. Collectively, these important stability findings open possibilities for applications involving a wide pH and temperature ranges.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of the enzymatically active legumain-like cysteine proteinase TvLEGU-1 of Trichomonas vaginalis in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>G. Resendiz-Cardiel, R. Arroyo, J. Ortega-Lopez, Protein Expr Purif 134 104 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419821>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The legumain-like cysteine proteinase TvLEGU-1 from Trichomonas vaginalis plays a major role in trichomonal cytoadherence. However, its structure-function characterization has been limited by the lack of a reliable recombinant expression platform to produce this protein in its native folded conformation. TvLEGU-1 has been expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and all efforts to refold it have failed. Here, we describe the expression of the synthetic codon-optimized tvlegu-1 (tvlegu-1-opt) gene in Pichia pastoris strain X-33 (Mut+) under the inducible AOX1 promoter. The active TvLEGU-1 recombinant protein (rTvLEGU-1) was secreted into the medium when tvlegu-1-opt was fused to the Aspergillus niger alpha-amylase signal peptide. The rTvLEGU-1 secretion was influenced by the gene copy number and induction temperature. Data indicate that increasing tvlegu-1-opt gene copy number was detrimental for heterologous expression of the enzymatically active TvLEGU-1. Indeed, expression of TvLEGU-1 had a greater impact on cell viability for those clones with 26 or 29 gene copy number, and cell lysis was observed when the induction was carried out at 30 degrees C. The enzyme activity in the medium was higher when the induction was carried out at 16 degrees C and in P. pastoris clones with lower gene copy number. The results presented here suggest that both copy number and induction temperature affect the rTvLEGU-1 expression in its native-like and active conformation.</p></details><hr><h4>Sweat allergy: Extrinsic or intrinsic?</h4><p>T. Hiragun et al., J Dermatol Sci   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28416076>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Sweat is an exacerbation factor in atopic dermatitis (AD) in all age groups. A body core temperature elevation with sweating triggers cholinergic urticaria (CholU). We recently reported that AD symptoms are improved by tannic acid-containing spray, which suppresses the basophil histamine release induced by semi-purified sweat antigen in vitro, and by showering, which removes antigens in sweat from the skin surface. Sweat contains small amount of proteins including proteases, protease inhibitors, and anti-microbial peptides. We finally identified MGL_1304 secreted by Malassezia (M.) globosa as a major histamine - releasing antigen in human sweat. MGL_1304 is a 17-kDa protein in sweat that elicits almost the highest histamine - release activity from basophils of patients with AD and CholU among antigens derived from Malassezia species. Moreover, serum levels of anti-MGL_1304 IgE were significantly higher in patients with AD and CholU than in normal controls. The recombinant protein produced by Pichia pastoris possessed comparable allergenicity to native MGL_1304. We found a monoclonal IgE antibody against MGL_1304 which did not elicit histamine release from sensitized mast cells. Desensitization therapy using autologous sweat, or MGL_1304 purified from culture of M. globosa or its cognates might be beneficial for patients with intractable CholU due to sweat allergy.</p></details><hr><h4>Crystal structure of RNA polymerase II from Komagataella pastoris.</h4><p>H.

In this work, the crystal structure of Pol II from the methylotropic yeast Komagataella pastoris (Pichia pastoris) was determined. While the structure is highly homologous to that of Pol II from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the stalk and clamp modules of the K. pastoris Pol II displayed large inward rotations, closing the central cleft to a greater extent than in the known S. cerevisiae Pol II structures. The conformational differences reflect the inherent flexibilities of the stalk and the clamp, as additional low-resolution structures of K. pastoris Pol II in different crystal forms revealed diverse stalk and clamp orientations. Comparisons with other eukaryotic/archaeal RNA polymerase structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed the distributions of the stalk and clamp orientations. The conformational plasticity should be essential for transcriptional functions and binding various regulatory factors.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression of Thermobifida fusca E7 LPMO in Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli and their functional characterization.</h4><p>K. B. Rodrigues et al., Carbohydr Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411891>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The discovery of lytic polysaccharides monooxygenases copper dependent (LPMOs) revolutionized the classical concept that the cleavage of cellulose is a hydrolytic process in recent years. These enzymes carry out oxidative cleavage of cellulose (and other polysaccharides), acting synergistically with cellulases and other hydrolases. In fact, LPMOs have the potential for increasing the efficiency of the lignocellulosic biomass conversion in biofuels and high value chemicals. Among a small number of microbial LPMOs that have been characterized, some LPMOs were expressed and characterized biochemically from the bacteria Thermobifida fusca, using the host Escherichia coli. In this work, the E7 LPMO protein of T. fusca was expressed both in E. coli (native DNA sequence) and Pichia pastoris (codon-optimized DNA sequence), for further analysis of oxidative cleavage, with PASC (phosphoric acid swollen cellulose) and Avicel PH-101 substrates, using mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectra results of Avicel PH-101 and PASC cleavages by purified E7 LPMO expressed in E. coli and in P. pastoris allowed the visualization of compounds corresponding to oxidized and non-oxidized oligosaccharides. Further optimization of reactions will be performed, since it was found only one degree of polymerization (DP 7). This work demonstrated that it is possible to produce the E7 LPMO from T. fusca in the host P. pastoris, and the recombinant protein was shown to be active on cellulose. The approach used in the present work could be an alternative to produce this bacterial LPMO for cellulose cleavage.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular strategies to increase the levels of heterologous transcripts in Komagataella phaffii for protein production.</h4><p>L.

T. Chang et al., PLoS One 12 e0175321 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399159>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Rhodostomin (Rho) is a medium disintegrin containing a 48PRGDMP motif. We here showed that Rho proteins with P48A, M52W, and P53N mutations can selectively inhibit integrin alphaIIbbeta3. To study the roles of the RGD loop and C-terminal region in disintegrins, we expressed Rho 48PRGDMP and 48ARGDWN mutants in Pichia pastoris containing 65P, 65PR, 65PRYH, 65PRNGLYG, and 65PRNPWNG C-terminal sequences. The effect of C-terminal region on their integrin binding affinities was alphaIIbbeta3 > alphavbeta3 >/= alpha5beta1, and the 48ARGDWN-65PRNPWNG protein was the most selective integrin alphaIIbbeta3 mutant. The 48ARGDWN-65PRYH, 48ARGDWN-65PRNGLYG, and 48ARGDWN-65PRNPWNG mutants had similar activities in inhibiting platelet aggregation and the binding of fibrinogen to platelet. In contrast, 48ARGDWN-65PRYH and 48ARGDWN-65PRNGLYG exhibited 2.9- and 3.0-fold decreases in inhibiting cell adhesion in comparison with that of 48ARGDWN-65PRNPWNG. Based on the results of cell adhesion, platelet aggregation and the binding of fibrinogen to platelet inhibited by ARGDWN mutants, integrin alphaIIbbeta3 bound differently to immobilized and soluble fibrinogen. NMR structural analyses of 48ARGDWN-65PRYH, 48ARGDWN-65PRNGLYG, and 48ARGDWN-65PRNPWNG mutants demonstrated that their C-terminal regions interacted with the RGD loop. In particular, the W52 sidechain of 48ARGDWN interacted with H68 of 65PRYH, L69 of 65PRNGLYG, and N70 of 65PRNPWNG, respectively. The docking of the 48ARGDWN-65PRNPWNG mutant into integrin alphaIIbbeta3 showed that the N70 residue formed hydrogen bonds with the alphaIIb D159 residue, and the W69 residue formed cation-pi interaction with the beta3 K125 residue. These results provide the first structural evidence that the interactions between the RGD loop and C-terminus of medium disintegrins depend on their amino acid sequences, resulting in their functional differences in the binding and selectivity of integrins.</p></details><hr><h4>Implementation of data-dependent isotopologue fragmentation in 13C-based metabolic flux analysis.</h4><p>T.

The implemented QTOFMS method employs automated MS/MS triggering of higher abundant, biologically relevant isotopologues for generating positional information of the respective metabolite. Using this advanced isotopologue selective fragmentation approach enables the generation of significant tandem mass isotopomer data within a short cycle time without compromising sensitivity. Due to a lack of suitable reference material certified for isotopologue ratios, a Pichia pastoris cell extract with a defined 13C distribution as well as a cell extract from a 13C-based metabolic flux experiment were employed for proof of concept. Moreover, a method inter-comparison with an already established GC-CI-(Q)TOFMS approach was conducted. Both methods showed good agreement on isotopologue and tandem mass isotopomer distributions for the two different cell extracts.

Sm14 belongs to a family of fatty-acid binding proteins and appears to play an important role in uptake, transport, and compartmentalization of lipids in S. mansoni and it is a potential vaccine candidate in both humans and domesticated animals. The Sm14 gene was codon-optimized for expression in P. pastoris, and placed under transcription of the strong methanol inducible AOX1 promoter. Mut+ transformants were selected and used in fed-batch cultivation using a 2.5L fermenter equipped with an on-line methanol control system in order to maintain constant methanol levels during induction. Optimal conditions for the expression of Sm14 by P. pastoris were found to be: dissolved oxygen at 40%, temperature of 25 degrees C, pH 5.0, and a constant methanol concentration of 1 gL-1. Our results show that a correctly processed Sm14 was secreted into the culture medium at levels of approximately 250 mg L-1. Sm14 from clarified culture medium was purified using a two-step procedure: anion-exchange chromatography followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, resulting in >95% purity with a final yield of 40% from the starting cell culture medium. This product has been tested in preliminary clinical trials and shown to elicit an antibody response with no adverse reactions.</p></details><hr><h4>A new proteinaceous pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) identified in Ascomycete fungi induces cell death in Solanaceae.</h4><p>B.

The ability of RcCDI1 and its homologues from different fungal species to induce cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana was tested following agroinfiltration or infiltration of recombinant proteins produced by Pichia pastoris. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and transient expression of Phytophthora infestans effectors PiAVR3a and PexRD2 were used to assess the involvement of known components of PTI in N. benthamiana responses to RcCDI1. RcCDI1 was highly upregulated early during barley colonization with R. commune. RcCDI1 and its homologues from different fungal species, including Zymoseptoria tritici, Magnaporthe oryzae and Neurospora crassa, exhibited PAMP activity, inducing cell death in Solanaceae but not in other families of dicots or monocots. RcCDI1-triggered cell death was shown to require N. benthamiana Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-Associated Kinase 1 (NbBAK1), N. benthamiana suppressor of BIR1-1 (NbSOBIR1) and N. benthamiana SGT1 (NbSGT1), but was not suppressed by PiAVR3a or PexRD2. We report the identification of a novel Ascomycete PAMP, RcCDI1, recognized by Solanaceae but not by monocots, which activates cell death through a pathway that is distinct from that triggered by the oomycete PAMP INF1.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of Chimeric Acidic alpha-Amylase by the Recombinant Pichia pastoris and Its Applications.</h4><p>D.

Clones of P. pastoris with multiple gene copies have been generated by multiple transformations and post-transformational vector amplification, which led to 10.7-fold enhancement in alpha-amylase titre as compared to a clone with a copy of the gene. The recombinant P. pastoris integrated eight copies of Ba-Gt-amy in the genome of P. pastoris, as revealed by real time PCR data analysis. Heterologous protein expression as well as mRNA level of Ba-Gt-amy was higher in multi-copy clone than that with single copy. The pure Ba-Gt-amy expressed in P. pastoris is a glycoprotein of 75 kDa, which is optimally active at pH 4.0 and 60 degrees C with T1/2 of 40 min at 70 degrees C. The Kinetic parameters and end product analysis suggested that glycosylation has no effect on catalytic properties of Ba-Gt-amy. The enzyme saccharifies soluble as well as raw starches efficiently and generates maltose and maltooligosaccharides, thus, useful in baking and sugar syrup industries. The strategy for generating multi-copy clones is being reported for the first time, which could be useful in enhancing the production of other recombinant proteins.</p></details><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris versus Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a case study on the recombinant production of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.</h4><p>A.

Recombinant hGM-CSF is produced industrially using the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by large-scale fermentation. The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, has emerged as an alternative host cell system due to its shorter and less immunogenic glycosylation pattern together with higher cell density growth and higher secreted protein yield than S. cerevisiae. In this study, we compared the pipeline from gene to recombinant protein in these two yeasts.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Codon optimization in silico for both yeast species showed no difference in frequent codon usage. However, rhGM-CSF expressed from S. cerevisiae BY4742 showed a significant discrepancy in molecular weight from those of P. pastoris X33. Analysis showed purified rhGM-CSF species with molecular weights ranging from 30 to more than 60 kDa. Fed-batch fermentation over 72 h showed that rhGM-CSF was more highly secreted from P. pastoris than S. cerevisiae (285 and 64 mg total secreted protein/L, respectively). Ion exchange chromatography gave higher purity and recovery than hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified rhGM-CSF from P. pastoris was 327 times more potent than rhGM-CSF from S. cerevisiae in terms of proliferative stimulating capacity on the hGM-CSF-dependent cell line, TF-1.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Our data support a view that the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris is an effective recombinant host for heterologous rhGM-CSF production.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancement of recombinant BmK AngM1 production in Pichia pastoris by regulating gene dosage, co-expressing with chaperones and fermenting in fed-batch mode.</h4><p>Q.

The heterologous expression of BmK AngM1 was achieved in Pichia pastoris in our previous study. In order to realize high-level expression of recombinant BmK AngM1 (rBmK AngM1), the gene dosage of BmK AngM1 was optimized in engineered strains. The yield of rBmK AngM1 in the four-copy strain reached up to 100 mg/L, which was further enhanced to 190 mg/L by co-expressing with chaperones of PDI, BiP, and HAC1. Moreover, the yield of rBmK AngM1 was up to 1200 mg/L by high-density fermentation in 10 L fermenter. Finally, 360 mg rBmK AngM1 was purified from 1 L cultures by a two-step purification method. The efficient and convenient techniques presented in this study could facilitate further scale-up for industrial production of rBmK AngM1.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and expression of a chitinase gene from Eisenia fetida.</h4><p>M.

In this study, we identified a chitinase gene, named Eisenia fetida-Chitinase (EF-Chi) gene, of 1494 base pairs (bp) that encodes a protein of 498 amino acids as indicated by the corresponding mRNA sequence. The amino acid sequence of EF-Chi was similar to those of chitinases from Eisenia andrei (99%), Branchiostoma floridae (50%) and Oryzias latipes (49%), and a gene encoding mature EF-Chi was expressed in the GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of the purified recombinant EF-Chi (rEF-Chi) was estimated to be 60kDa and catalytically important residues of chitinases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 18 were conserved in EF-Chi. The optimal catalytic temperature of rEF-Chi was identified as 60 degrees C, and the hydrolytic product from colloidal chitin was N-acetyl-chitobiose, suggesting that EF-Chi is an exo-type enzyme.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a new laccase from Moniliophthora roreri at high levels in Pichia pastoris and its potential application in micropollutant degradation.</h4><p>A.

One of the prerequisites for the industrial application of laccases is their sufficient availability. However, expression levels of recombinantly expressed laccases are often low. In this study Mrl2, a new laccase from the basidiomycete Moniliophthora roreri, was cloned in Pichia pastoris and produced in an optimized fed-batch process at an exceptionally high yield of 1.05 g l-1. With a redox potential of 0.58 V, Mrl2 belongs to mid-redox potential laccases. However, Mrl2 demonstrated high kcat values of 316, 20, 74, and 36 s-1 towards 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), syringaldazine (SGZ), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP) and guaiacol, respectively. Mrl2 remained stable above pH 6 and in the presence of many metal ions, which is important for application in bioremediation. Mrl2 was investigated for the ability to degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSDAIs) at neutral pH value. The enzyme accepted and converted estrone, 17beta-estradiol, estriol, the synthetic contraceptive 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and bisphenol A at pH 7 faster than high-potential laccases from Trametes versicolor. For example, within 30 min Mrl2 removed more than 90% bisphenol A, 17ss-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and estriol, respectively. The concentration of the recalcitrant drug diclofenac dropped by 56% after 20 h incubation with Mrl2.</p></details><hr><h4>Effects of UPR and ERAD pathway on the prolyl endopeptidase production in Pichia pastoris by controlling of nitrogen source.</h4><p>X.

Pichia pastoris has been used for the PEP production; however, the fermentation process has not be investigated and little is known about the impact of excessive PEP production on the host cell physiology. Here, we optimized the nitrogen source to improve the PEP expression level and further evaluated the cellular response including UPR and ERAD. During methanol induction phase the PEP activity (1583 U/L) was increased by 1.48-fold under the optimized nitrogen concentration of NH4+ (300 mmol/L) and casamino acids [1.0% (w/v)] in a 3-L bioreactor. Evaluated by RT-PCR the UPR and ERAD pathways were confirmed to be activated. Furthermore, a strong decrease of ERAD-related gene transcription was observed with the addition of nitrogen source, which contributed to a higher PEP expression level.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression, purification and characterization of three novel esterases secreted by the lignocellulolytic fungus Penicillium purpurogenum when grown on sugar beet pulp.</h4><p>G.

Culture supernatants of P. purpurogenum grown on sugar beet pulp were partially purified and the fractions obtained analyzed for esterase activity by zymograms. The bands with activity on methyl umbelliferyl acetate were subjected to mass spectrometry to identify peptides. The peptides obtained were probed against the proteins deduced from the genome sequence of P. purpurogenum. Eight putative esterases thus identified were chosen for future work. Their cDNAs were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The supernatants of the recombinant clones were assayed for esterase activity, and five of the proteins were active against one or more substrates: methyl umbelliferyl acetate, indoxyl acetate, methyl esterified pectin and fluorescein diacetate. Three of those enzymes were purified, further characterized and subjected to a BLAST search. Based on their amino acid sequence and properties, they were identified as follows: RAE1, pectin acetyl esterase (CAZy family CE 12); FAEA, feruloyl esterase (could not be assigned to a CAZy family) and EAN, acetyl esterase (former CAZy family CE 10).</p></details><hr><h4>Expressing anti-HIV VRC01 antibody using the murine IgG1 secretion signal in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R.

Compared to mammalian cultures, expression in P. pastoris is cheaper and faster, potentially leading to decreased costs and process development times. Product yields depend on a number of factors including the secretion signal chosen for expression, which can influence the host cell response to recombinant protein production. VRC01, a broadly neutralising anti-HIV antibody, was expressed in P. pastoris, using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter for both the heavy and light chains. Titre reached up to 3.05 mug mL-1 in small scale expression. VRC01 was expressed using both the alpha-mating factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the murine IgG1 signal peptide. Surprisingly, using the murine IgG1 signal peptide resulted in higher yield of antibody capable of binding gp140 antigen. Furthermore, we evaluated levels of secretory stress compared to the untransformed wild-type strain and show a reduced level of secretory stress in the murine IgG1 signal peptide strains versus those containing the alpha-MF signal peptide. As bottlenecks in the secretory pathway are often the limiting factor in protein secretion, reduced levels of secretory stress and the higher yield of functional antibody suggest the murine IgG1 signal peptide may lead to better protein folding and secretion. This work indicates the possibilities for utilising the murine IgG1 signal peptide for a range of antibodies, resulting in high yields and reduced cellular stress.</p></details><hr><h4>Generation, characterization and immunogenicity of a novel chimeric recombinant protein based on Plasmodium vivax AMA-1 and MSP119.</h4><p>M.

Vaccine development against P. vivax is considered a priority in the global program for the eradication of malaria. Earlier studies have characterized the Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA-1) ectodomain and the C-terminal region (19kDa) of the Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP-1) of P. vivax as immunodominant antigens. Based on this characterization, we designed a chimeric recombinant protein containing both merozoite immunodominant domains (PvAMA166-MSP119). The recombinant PvAMA166-MSP119 was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and used to immunize two different mouse strains (BALB/c and C57BL/6) in the presence of the Poly (</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C) as an adjuvant. Immunization with the chimeric protein induced high antibody titers against both proteins in both strains of mice as detected by ELISA. Antisera also recognized the native proteins expressed on the merozoites of mature P. vivax schizonts. Moreover, this antigen was able to induce IFN-gamma-secreting cells in C57BL/6 mice. These findings indicate that this novel yeast recombinant protein containing PvAMA166 and PvMSP119 is advantageous, because of improved antibody titers and cellular immune response. Therefore, this formulation should be further developed for pre-clinical trials in non-human primates as a potential candidate for a P. vivax vaccine.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolomics of Pichia pastoris: Impact of buffering conditions on the kinetics and nature of metabolite loss during quenching.</h4><p>M. Mattanovich et al., FEMS Yeast Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334329>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Mass spectrometry based metabolomic profiling is a powerful strategy to quantify the concentrations of numerous primary metabolites in parallel. To avoid distortion of metabolite concentrations, quenching is applied to stop the cellular metabolism instantly. For yeasts, cold methanol quenching is accepted to be the most suitable method to stop metabolism, while keeping the cells intact for separation from the supernatant. During this treatment, metabolite loss may occur while the cells are suspended in the quenching solution. An experiment for measuring the time dependent loss of selected primary metabolites in differently buffered quenching solutions was conducted to study pH and salt concentration dependent effects. Molecular properties of the observed metabolites were correlated with the kinetics of loss to gain insight into the mechanisms of metabolite leakage. Size and charge related properties play a major role in controlling metabolite loss. We found evidence that interaction with the cell wall is the main determinant to retain a molecule inside the cell. Besides suggesting an improved quenching protocol to keep loss at a minimum, we could establish a more general understanding of the process of metabolite loss during quenching, which will allow to predict optimal conditions for hitherto not analysed metabolites.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcription factor Mxr1 promotes the expression of Aox1 by repressing glycerol transporter 1 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

In this study, the relationship between alcohol oxidase 1 (aox1), methanol expression regulator 1 (mxr1) and glycerol transporter 1 (gt1) was studied. By RT-PCR, it was found that the overexpression of gt1 could increase the glycerol content in cells and repress the expression of mxr1 and aox1, and the deletion of gt1 reduced the glycerol content in cells and promoted the expression of aox1 .The overexpression of mxr1 could repress the expression of gt1, and the deletion of mxr1 could promote the expression of gt1 to some extent. By EMSA, Mxr1 binding sites were found in the promoter of gt1 (PGt1.) (-141 to -138, CCCC), and Mxr1 could regulate the expression of gt1 by binding to PGt1. The relationships among aox1, mxr1 and gt1 revealed here to provide a reference for the understanding of the mechanism of glycerol repression of PAox1.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of maize chitinase-A, a tough allergenic molecule.</h4><p>M.

They are caused by specific proteins called food allergens. Proteins commonly identified as food allergens tend to have one of about 30 different biochemical activities. This leads to the assumption that food allergens must have specific structural features which causes their allergenicity. But these structural features are not completely understood. Uncovering the structural basis of allergenicity would allow improved diagnosis and therapy of allergies and would provide insights for safer food production. The availability of recombinant food allergens can accelerate their structural analysis, and benefit specific studies in allergology. Plant chitinases are an example of food allergenic proteins for which structural analysis of allergenicity has only partially been reported.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> The recombinant maize chitinase, rChiA, was purified from Pichia pastoris extracellular medium by differential precipitation and cation exchange chromatography. Enzyme activity was evaluated by halo-assays and microcalorimetric procedures. rChiA modeling was performed by a two-step procedure, using the Swissmodel server and Modeller software. Allergenicity of rChiA was verified by immunoblot assays with sera from allergic subjects.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> rChiA is active in the hydrolysis of glycol chitin and N-acetylchitotetraose, and maintains its activity at high temperatures (70 degrees C) and low pH (pH 3).

We successfully expressed human CapG in the wild type strain X-33 of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris), which does not express endogenous CapG, in order to characterize this protein in more detail. After mechanical cell lysis, debris was centrifuged and the soluble protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. This protein pellet was dialyzed and used for CapG purification. Ca2+-dependent exposure of hydrophobic sites allowed single step and selective elution from a Phenyl Sepharose matrix. 3.5 mg CapG/10 g wet biomass were isolated and showed a Ca2+-sensitive and dose-dependent capping activity of actin in a fluorometric assay. In P. pastoris, CapG is located at actin patches, actin cables and arranges along the budding neck. The proliferation rate and morphology of the yeast cells are not influenced by the interaction of CapG with actin. The modification pattern of human CapG from P. pastoris and human carcinoma cells is highly similar. We validated most of the known post-translational modifications and found three new phosphorylation and nine new acetylation sites by mass spectrometry. The N-terminus is acetylated or truncated. Truncated CapG is not phosphorylated at the residues S10, T212 and S337. First mutagenesis experiments indicate an N-terminal acetylation dependent C-terminal phosphorylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient extracellular expression of transpeptidase sortase A in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

After the optimization of fermentation conditions (induction 72 h at 28 degrees C, initial pH 6.0, supplemented with 1.5% methanol), the highest yield and activity of extracellular SrtA reached 97.8 mg/L and 131.9 U/mL at the shake-flask level, respectively. This is the first report on the efficient secretory expression of SrtA in P. pastoris and the yield of SrtA is the maximum compared with previous reports. In addition, the transpeptidation activity of extracellular SrtA was confirmed by the successful immobilization of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) onto Gly3-polystyrene beads.</p></details><hr><h4>Diphtheria toxin-based anti-human CD19 immunotoxin for targeting human CD19+ tumors.</h4><p>Q.

However, there is still an unmet need to further develop novel therapeutic drugs for the treatment of the refractory/relapsing human CD19+ tumors. We have developed a diphtheria toxin-based anti-human CD19 immunotoxin for targeting human CD19+ tumors. We have constructed three isoforms of the CD19 immunotoxin: monovalent, bivalent, and foldback diabody. In vitro binding affinity and efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform had the highest binding affinity and in vitro efficacy. The in vivo efficacy of the CD19 immunotoxins was assessed using human CD19+ JeKo-1 tumor-bearing NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor gamma-/- (NSG) mouse model. In these animals, CD19 immunotoxins significantly prolonged the median survival from 31 days in controls to 34, 36, and 40 days in animals receiving the monovalent isoform, foldback diabody isoform, and bivalent isoform, respectively. The bivalent CD19 immunotoxin is a promising therapeutic drug candidate for targeting relapsing/refractory human CD19+ tumors.</p></details><hr><h4>Implications of evolutionary engineering for growth and recombinant protein production in methanol-based growth media in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J.

Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has been applied in a wide range of studies in order to improve strains for biotechnological purposes. In this context, the impact of long-term carbon source adaptation in P. pastoris has not been addressed so far. Thus, we performed a pilot experiment in order to analyze the applicability and potential benefits of ALE towards improved growth and recombinant protein production in P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Adaptation towards growth on methanol was performed in replicate cultures in rich and minimal growth medium for 250 generations. Increased growth rates on these growth media were observed at the population and single clone level. Evolved populations showed various degrees of growth advantages and trade-offs in non-evolutionary growth conditions. Genome resequencing revealed a wide variety of potential genetic targets associated with improved growth performance on methanol-based growth media. Alcohol oxidase represented a mutational hotspot since four out of seven evolved P. pastoris clones harbored mutations in this gene, resulting in decreased Aox activity, despite increased growth rates. Selected clones displayed strain-dependent variations for AOX-promoter based recombinant protein expression yield. One particularly interesting clone showed increased product titers ranging from a 2.5-fold increase in shake flask batch culture to a 1.8-fold increase during fed batch cultivation.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our data indicate a complex correlation of carbon source, growth context and recombinant protein production. While similar experiments have already shown their potential in other biotechnological areas where microbes were evolutionary engineered for improved stress resistance and growth, the current dataset encourages the analysis of the potential of ALE for improved protein production in P. pastoris on a broader scale.</p></details><hr><h4>Corrigendum: High-level expression of improved thermo-stable alkaline xylanase variant in Pichia Pastoris through codon optimization, multiple gene insertion and high-density fermentation.</h4><p>Y.

The objective of this study was to establish a potential approach for large scale production of VSV-G. To this end, VSV-G was cloned with a N-terminal His-tag into Pichia pastoris expression vector pPIC3.5K. Three clones (Muts) containing the VSV-G expression cassette were identified by PCR. All clones proliferated normally in expansion medium, while the proliferation was reduced significantly under induction conditions. VSV-G protein was detected in cell lysates by Western Blot, and the highest expression level was observed at 96 h post induction. VSV-G could also be obtained from the condition medium of yeast protoplasts. Further, VSV-G could be incorporated into Ad293 cells and was able to induce cell fusion, leading to the transfer of cytoplasmic protein. Finally, VSV-G mediated DNA transfection was assayed by flow cytometry and luciferase measurement. Incubation of VSV-G lysate with pGL3-control DNA complex increased luciferase activity in Ad293 and HeLa cells by about 3-fold. Likewise, incubation of VSV-G lysate with pCMV-DsRed DNA complex improved transfection efficiency into Ad293 by 10% and HeLa cells by about 1-fold. In conclusions, these results demonstrated that VSV-G could be produced from Pichia pastoris with bio-functionalities, demonstrating large scale production of the viral glycoprotein is feasible.</p></details><hr><h4>Increased dosage of AOX1 promoter-regulated expression cassettes leads to transcription attenuation of the methanol metabolism in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>E.

Although increasing gene dosage is one of the most common strategies to increase recombinant protein productivities, the increase of gene dosage of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) in P. pastoris has been previously shown to reduce cell growth, lipase production and substrate consumption in high-copy strains. To better assess that physiological response, transcriptomics analysis was performed of a subset of strains with 1 to 15 ROL copies. The macroscopic physiological parameters confirm that growth yield and carbon uptake rate are gene dosage dependent, and were supported by the transcriptomic data, showing the impact of increased dosage of AOX1 promoter-regulated expression cassettes on P. pastoris physiology under steady methanolic growth conditions. Remarkably, increased number of cassettes led to transcription attenuation of the methanol metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis in P. pastoris, concomitant with reduced secretion levels of the heterologous product. Moreover, our data also point to a block in ROL mRNA translation in the higher ROL-copies constructs, while the low productivities of multi-copy strains under steady growth conditions do not appear to be directly related to UPR and ERAD induction.</p></details><hr><h4>CFP10: mFcgamma2 as a novel tuberculosis vaccine candidate increases immune response in mouse.</h4><p>A.

Baghani et al., Iran J Basic Med Sci 20 122 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293387>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> Despite treatment with antibiotics and vaccination with BCG, tuberculosis (TB) is still considered as one of the most important public health problems in the world. Therefore, designing and producing a more effective vaccine against TB seems urgently. In this study, immunogenicity of a fusion protein which consisting or comprising CFP-10 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the Fc-domain of mouse IgG2a was evaluated as a novel subunit vaccine candidate against TB.</p><p><strong> MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> The genetic constructs were cloned in pPICZalphaA expression vector and recombinant vectors (pPICZalphaA-CFP-10: Fcgamma2a and pPICZalphaA-CFP-10:His) were transformed into Pichia pastoris. To evaluate the expression of recombinant proteins, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were used. The immunogenicity of recombinant proteins, with and without BCG were assessed in BALB/c mice and specific cytokines against recombinant proteins (IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-4, IL-17 and TGF-beta) were evaluated.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in mice that received recombinant proteins was higher than the control groups (BCG and PBS). Thus, both recombinant proteins (CFP-10:Fcgamma2a and CFP-10:His) could excite good response in Th1-cells. The Fc-tagged protein had a stronger Th1 response with low levels of IL-4, as compared to CFP-10:His. However, the highest level of Th1 response was observed in groups that were vaccinated with BCG (prime) and then received recombinant protein CFP-10: Fcgamma2a (booster).</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The results demonstrated that binding mice Fc-domain to CFP-10 protein can increase the immunogenicity of the subunit vaccine. Further studies, might be able to design and produce a new generation of subunit vaccines based on the Fc-fused immunogen.</p></details><hr><h4>Expanding the feruloyl esterase gene family of Aspergillus niger by characterization of a feruloyl esterase, FaeC.</h4><p>A. Dilokpimol et al., N Biotechnol 37 200 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285179>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A feruloyl esterase (FAE) from Aspergillus niger N402, FaeC was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris X-33 in a yield of 10mg/L. FaeC was most active at pH 7.0 and 50 degrees C, and showed broad substrate specificity and catalyzed the hydrolysis of methyl 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate, ethyl ferulate, methyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, ethyl coumarate, methyl sinapate, and methyl caffeate. The enzyme released both ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from wheat arabinoxylan and sugar beet pectin (up to 3mg/g polysaccharide), and acted synergistically with a commercial xylanase increasing the release of ferulic acid up to six-fold. The expression of faeC increased over time in the presence of feruloylated polysaccharides. Cinnamic, syringic, caffeic, vanillic and ferulic acid induced the expression of faeC. Overall expression of faeC was very low in all tested conditions, compared to two other A. niger FAE encoding genes, faeA and faeB. Our data showed that the fae genes responded differently towards the feruloylated polysaccharides and tested monomeric phenolic compounds suggesting that the corresponding FAE isoenzymes may target different substrates in a complementary manner. This may increase the efficiency of the degradation of diverse plant biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular identification and functional analysis of Ctrp9 in Epinephelus coioides.</h4><p>G. Yang et al., J Mol Endocrinol 58 179 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283578>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>CTRP9 is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) superfamily and has been studied in mammals, whereas the comparative studies of CTRP9 in non-mammalian species are still absent. In this study, ctrp9 was isolated and characterized from the orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The full-length cDNA of ctrp9 was 1378 bp in size with an ORF (open reading frame) of 1020 bp that encodes a 339 amino acid pre-pro hormone. The mRNA expression of ctrp9 showed a rather high level in the kidney and brain, but a low level in other tissues. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of ctrp9 decreased significantly in the liver after fasting for 7 days and restored to the normal levels after refeeding. In contrast, the ctrp9 mRNA level increased in the hypothalamus after fasting. The recombinant gCtrp9 (globular Ctrp9) was prepared using the Pichia pastoris expression system and was verified by Western blot as well as mass spectrometry assays. In the primary hepatocytes culture, the recombinant gCtrp9 could inhibit the glucose production after 12-h treatment. After i.p. (intraperitoneal) injection with recombinant gCtrp9, in hypothalamus, mRNA expression levels of npy and orexin (orexigenic factors) decreased, whereas the expression levels of crh and pomc (anorexigenic factors) increased. Moreover, i.p. injection with the recombinant gCtrp9 could reduce the serum concentrations of glucose, TG and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increase the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Our studies for the first time unveil the structure of Ctrp9 and its potential role as a regulatory factor of metabolism and food intake in teleost.</p></details><hr><h4>Potential of Pichia pastoris for the production of industrial penicillin G acylase.</h4><p>H. Maresova et al., Folia Microbiol (Praha)   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281229>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study deals with the potential of Pichia pastoris X-33 for the production of penicillin G acylase (PGAA) from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824. Synthetic gene matching the codon usage of P. pastoris was designed for intracellular and secretion-based production strategies and cloned into vectors pPICZ and pPICZalpha under the control of AOX1 promoter. The simple method was developed to screen Pichia transformants with the intracellularly produced enzyme. The positive correlation between acylase production and pga gene dosage for both expression systems was demonstrated in small scale experiments. In fed-batch bioreactor cultures of X-33/PENS2, an extracellular expression system, total PGAA expressed from five copies reached 14,880 U/L of an active enzyme after 142 h; however, 60% of this amount retained in the cytosol. The maximum PGAA production of 31,000 U/L was achieved intracellularly from nine integrated gene copies of X-33/PINS2 after 90 h under methanol induction. The results indicate that in both expression systems the production level of PGAA is similar but there is a limitation in secretion efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Single amino acid substitutions in the selectivity filter render NbXIP1;1alpha aquaporin water permeable.</h4><p>H. Ampah-Korsah et al., BMC Plant Biol 17 61 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279171>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane proteins that facilitate transport of water and/or other small neutral solutes across membranes in all forms of life. The X Intrinsic Proteins (XIPs) are the most recently recognized and the least characterized aquaporin subfamily in higher plants. XIP1s have been shown to be impermeable to water but permeable to boric acid, glycerol, hydrogen peroxide and urea. However, uncertainty regarding the determinants for selectivity and lack of an activity that is easy to quantify have hindered functional investigations. In an effort to resolve these issues, we set out to introduce water permeability in Nicotiana benthamiana XIP1;1alpha (NbXIP1;1alpha), by exchanging amino acid residues of predicted alternative aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filters of NbXIP1;1alpha for residues constituting the water permeable ar/R selectivity filter of AtTIP2;1.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Here, we present functional results regarding the amino acid substitutions in the putative filters as well as deletions in loops C and D of NbXIP1;1alpha. In addition, homology models were created based on the high resolution X-ray structure of AtTIP2;1 to rationalize the functional properties of wild-type and mutant NbXIP1;1alpha. Our results favour Thr 246 rather than Val 242 as the residue at the helix 5 position in the ar/R filter of NbXIP1;1alpha and indicate that the pore is not occluded by the loops when heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Moreover, our results show that a single amino acid substitution in helix 1 (L79G) or in helix 2 (I102H) is sufficient to render NbXIP1;1alpha water permeable. Most of the functional results can be rationalized from the models based on a combination of aperture and hydrophobicity of the ar/R filter.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The water permeable NbXIP1;1alpha mutants imply that the heterologously expressed proteins are correctly folded and offer means to explore the structural and functional properties of NbXIP1;1alpha. Our results support that Thr 246 is part of the ar/R filter. Furthermore, we suggest that a salt bridge to an acidic residue in helix 1, conserved among the XIPs in clade B, directs the orientation of the arginine in the ar/R selectivity filter and provides a novel approach to tune the selectivity of AQPs.</p></details><hr><h4>Complement inhibition by Sarcoptes scabiei protects Streptococcus pyogenes - An in vitro study to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the poorly understood predilection of S. pyogenes to infect mite-induced skin lesions.</h4><p>P. M. Swe et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 11 e0005437 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278252>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> On a global scale scabies is one of the most common dermatological conditions, imposing a considerable economic burden on individuals, communities and health systems. There is substantial epidemiological evidence that in tropical regions scabies is often causing pyoderma and subsequently serious illness due to invasion by opportunistic bacteria. The health burden due to complicated scabies causing cellulitis, bacteraemia and sepsis, heart and kidney diseases in resource-poor communities is extreme. Co-infections of group A streptococcus (GAS) and scabies mites is a common phenomenon in the tropics. Both pathogens produce multiple complement inhibitors to overcome the host innate defence. We investigated the relative role of classical (CP), lectin (LP) and alternative pathways (AP) towards a pyodermic GAS isolate 88/30 in the presence of a scabies mite complement inhibitor, SMSB4. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> Opsonophagocytosis assays in fresh blood showed baseline immunity towards GAS. The role of innate immunity was investigated by deposition of the first complement components of each pathway, specifically C1q, FB and MBL from normal human serum on GAS. C1q deposition was the highest followed by FB deposition while MBL deposition was undetectable, suggesting that CP and AP may be mainly activated by GAS. We confirmed this result using sera depleted of either C1q or FB, and serum deficient in MBL. Recombinant SMSB4 was produced and purified from Pichia pastoris. SMSB4 reduced the baseline immunity against GAS by decreasing the formation of CP- and AP-C3 convertases, subsequently affecting opsonisation and the release of anaphylatoxin. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Our results indicate that the complement-inhibitory function of SMSB4 promotes the survival of GAS in vitro and inferably in the microenvironment of the mite-infested skin. Understanding the tripartite interactions between host, parasite and microbial pathogens at a molecular level may serve as a basis to develop improved intervention strategies targeting scabies and associated bacterial infections.</p></details><hr><h4>Structure of SALO, a leishmaniasis vaccine candidate from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis.</h4><p>O. A. Asojo et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 11 e0005374 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278244>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Immunity to the sand fly salivary protein SALO (Salivary Anticomplement of Lutzomyia longipalpis) protected hamsters against Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis infection and, more recently, a vaccine combination of a genetically modified Leishmania with SALO conferred strong protection against L. donovani infection. Because of the importance of SALO as a potential component of a leishmaniasis vaccine, a plan to produce this recombinant protein for future scale manufacturing as well as knowledge of its structural characteristics are needed to move SALO forward for the clinical path. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> Recombinant SALO was expressed as a soluble secreted protein using Pichia pastoris, rSALO(P), with yields of 1g/L and >99% purity as assessed by SEC-MALS and SDS-PAGE. Unlike its native counterpart, rSALO(P) does not inhibit the classical pathway of complement; however, antibodies to rSALO(P) inhibit the anti-complement activity of sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Immunization with rSALO(P) produces a delayed type hypersensitivity response in C57BL/6 mice, suggesting rSALO(P) lacked anti-complement activity but retained its immunogenicity. The structure of rSALO(P) was solved by S-SAD at Cu-Kalpha to 1.94 A and refined to Rfactor 17%. SALO is ~80% helical, has no appreciable structural similarities to any human protein, and has limited structural similarity in the C-terminus to members of insect odorant binding proteins. SALO has three predicted human CD4+ T cell epitopes on surface exposed helices. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> The results indicate that SALO as expressed and purified from P. pastoris is suitable for further scale-up, manufacturing, and testing. SALO has a novel structure, is not similar to any human proteins, is immunogenic in rodents, and does not have the anti-complement activity observed in the native salivary protein which are all important attributes to move this vaccine candidate forward to the clinical path.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioactivity studies of Huh-7 cells derived human epidermal growth factor expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. A. Khan et al., Biosci Biotechnol Biochem  1 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278062>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Previously, we have reported cloning of human epidermal growth factor gene from Huh-7 cells and its extracellular expression in Pichia pastoris. The presented work is a detailed report regarding molecular characterization of Huh-7 cells-derived hEGF expressed in Pichia pastoris with special reference to its glycosylation profiling and bioactivity studies. Densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE separated extracellular proteins from hEGF recombinant Pichia pastoris strain indicated that about 84% of the extracellular proteins were glycosylated. Size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75 prep grade column was successfully utilized to separate fractions containing glycosylated and non-glycosylated extracellular proteins. In dot blot assay, hEGF was detected in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions. Bioactivity assays revealed that both glycosylated and non-glycosylated fractions were bioactive as determined by cell viability assay. It was also observed that hEGF present in non-glycosylated fraction was relatively more bioactive than hEGF present in glycosylated fraction.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative Analysis of Recombinant Cytochrome P450 CYP9A61 from Cydia pomonella Expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

In this study, recombinant CYP9A61 was expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, and its biochemical properties were investigated. Substrate saturation curves and biochemical properties revealed that, in the presence of glycosylation, the yeast-secreted CYP9A61 exhibited a higher affinity for the substrate p-nitroanisole and was found to be more stable at certain pHs and temperatures than bacterially produced CYP9A61. Half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of three synthetic pyrethroids on both the bacterium- and yeast-expressed CYP9A61 suggested that recombinant CYP9A61 expressed in different hosts exhibits different inhibition properties. Taken together, our findings show that yeast-expressed CYP9A61 exhibits enzyme activity that is better than that expressed in bacteria and might be used for further metabolism assays to reveal the insecticide-detoxifying role of CYP9A61 in C. pomonella.</p></details><hr><h4>Biotransformation of menadione to its prenylated derivative MK-3 using recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Z. Li et al., J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28258406>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prenylated quinones, especially menaquinones, have significant physiological activities, but are arduous to synthesize efficiently. Due to the relaxed aromatic substrate specificity and prenylation regiospecificity at the ortho- site of the phenolic hydroxyl group, the aromatic prenyltransferase NovQ from Streptomyces may be useful in menaquinone synthesis from menadione. In this study, NovQ was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. After fermentation optimization, NovQ production increased by 1617%. Then the different effects of metal ions, detergents and pH on the activity of purified NovQ were investigated to optimize the prenylation reaction. Finally, purified NovQ and cells containing NovQ were used for menadione prenylation in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Menaquinone-1 (MK-1) was detected as the only product in vitro with gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and menadione hydroquinol substrates. MK-3 at a concentration of 90.53 mg/L was detected as the major product of whole cell catalysis with 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and menadione hydroquinol substrates. This study realized whole cell catalysis converting menadione to menaquinones.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification of an acidic endo-polygalacturonase from Penicillium oxalicum CZ1028 and its broad use in major tropical and subtropical fruit juices production.</h4><p>Z.

A putative endo-polygalacturonase gene PoxaEnPG28A was cloned from Penicillium oxalicum CZ1028. PoxaEnPG28A consisted of a putative signal peptide and a catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 28, and it shared 72% identity with that of a functionally characterized endo-polygalacturonase from Trichoderma harzianum. Gene PoxaEnPG28A was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris with a high yield of 1828.7 U/mL. The purified recombinant enzyme PoxaEnPG28A hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in endo-manner releasing oligo-galacturonates. PoxaEnPG28A showed maximal activity at pH 5.5 and 55 degrees C, and was stable between pH 3.0 to 10.0 and below 45 degrees C. The kinetic constants Km and Vmax of PoxaEnPG28A were calculated as 1.57 g/L and 14,641.29 U/mg, respectively. PoxaEnPG28A significantly improved the yields of fruit juices from banana, plantain, papaya, pitaya and mango. The high production level of the recombinant enzyme PoxaEnPG28A by P. pastoris and remarkable catalytic activity of PoxaEnPG28A toward five kinds of fruit juices made the enzyme a potential application in agriculture and food industries.</p></details><hr><h4>A Modular Toolkit for Generating Pichia pastoris Secretion Libraries.</h4><p>U. Obst, T. K. Lu, V. Sieber, ACS Synth Biol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28252957>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Yeasts are powerful eukaryotic hosts for the production of recombinant proteins due to their rapid growth to high cell densities and ease of genetic modification. For large-scale industrial production, secretion of a protein offers the advantage of simple and efficient downstream purification that avoids costly cell rupture, denaturation and refolding. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffi) is a well-established expression host that has the ability to perform post-translational modifications and is generally regarded as safe (GRAS). Nevertheless, optimization of protein secretion in this host remains a challenge due to the multiple steps involved during secretion and a lack of genetic tools to tune this process. Here, we developed a toolkit of standardized regulatory elements specific for Pichia pastoris allowing the tuning of gene expression and choice of protein secretion tag. As protein secretion is a complex process, these parts are compatible with a hierarchical assembly method to enable the generation of large and diverse secretion libraries in order to explore a wide range of secretion constructs, achieve successful secretion, and better understand the regulatory factors of importance to specific proteins of interest. To assess the performance of these parts, we built and characterized the expression and secretion efficiency of 124 constructs that combined different regulatory elements with two fluorescent reporter proteins (RFP, yEGFP). Intracellular expression from our promoters was comparatively independent of whether RFP or yEGFP, and whether plasmid-based expression or genomically integrated expression, was used. In contrast, secretion efficiency significantly varied for different genes expressed using identical regulatory elements, with differences in secretion efficiency of >10-fold observed. These results highlight the importance of generating diverse secretion libraries when searching for optimal expression conditions, and demonstrate that our toolkit is a valuable asset for the creation of efficient microbial cell factories.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient Expression of an Acidic Endo-polygalacturonase from Aspergillus niger and Its Application in Juice Production.</h4><p>J.

The open reading frame of pga-zj5a was 1089 base pairs encoding 362 amino acids. Pga-zj5a lacking a signal peptide sequence was successfully amplified using A. niger ZJ5 cDNA as the template and was ligated into the pPIC9 vector. The resulting plasmid was transformed into competent cells of Pichia pastoris GS115 for heterologous expression. The polygalacturonase showed a maximum activity level of 10436 U/mL in the culture supernatant from a 3 L fermenter. Assays of enzymatic properties showed that the optimal pH and temperature of the recombinant PGA-ZJ5A were 4.5 and 40 degrees C, respectively. PGA-ZJ5A was effective in pear juice clarification, increased the volume of pear juice by 41.8%, and improved its light transmittance 3-fold.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular and catalytic properties of fungal extracellular cellobiose dehydrogenase produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems.</h4><p>S.

The CDH produced by T. reesei was most similar to the CDH originally isolated from the fungus C. thermophilus in regard to glycosylation, cofactor loading and catalytic constants. Under the tested experimental conditions the fungal expression hosts produce CDH of superior quality and uniformity compared to P. pastoris.</p></details>
