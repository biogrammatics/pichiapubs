This molecule serves as the main biological methyl donor due to its active methylthio ether group. Notably, SAM has shown beneficial effects in clinical trials for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease, depression and joint pain. Due to the high potential value of SAM, current research efforts are attempting to develop a more rapid, cost-effective and higher yielding SAM production method than the conventional production system. In this mini-review, we describe the previously reported yeast gene that contributes to SAM accumulation by overexpression, mutation or deletion and summarise the genetic approach for the production of SAM in large industrial quantities.</p></details><hr><h4>Utility of Thermostable Xylanases of Mycothermus thermophilus in Generating Prebiotic Xylooligosaccharides.</h4><p>R. Ma et al., J Agric Food Chem   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28067041>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Xylooligosaccharides as emerging prebiotics are able to promote the growth of probiotic bacteria. In the present study, four neutral, thermostable xylanases (MtXyn11A, MtXyn11At, MtXyn11B and MtXyn11C) from compost fungus Mycothermus thermophilus CGMCC3.18119 were overexpressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and used to produce xylooligosaccharides from beechwood xylan. The enzymes showed similar enzymatic properties (maximal activities at pH 6.06.5 and 65 C) but varied in catalytic efficiency and cleaving actions. MtXyn11A, MtXyn11At, and MtXyn11C mainly produced xylobiose (5962%), xylose (1620%), and xylotriose (1619%), while MtXyn11B released xylobiose (51%), xylotriose (32%), and xylose (12%) as the main products. When using the xylan hydrolysates of different xylanases as the carbon source, four probiotic Lactobacillus strains L. brevis 1.2028, L. rhamnosus GG, L. casei BL23, and L. plantarum WCSF1 were confirmed to utilize the xylooligosaccharides efficiently (83.898.2%), with L. brevis 1.2028 as the greatest.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and characteristics of the recombinant extracellular bifunctional endoglucanase of the polyextremophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans and its applicability in saccharifying agro-residues.</h4><p>R. R. Prabhu, D. Parashar, T. Satyanarayana, Bioprocess Biosyst Eng   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28039507>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The recombinant alkalistable and moderately thermostable bifunctional endoglucanase gene (BhCell-Xyl) of polyextremophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans TSLV1 has been expressed in Pichia pastoris under constitutive GAP as well as inducible AOX promoters. A higher titre of recombinant BhCell-Xyl was attained after induction (4.8 U mL-1) as compared to that of the constitutive production (2.1 U mL-1). The recombinant P. pastoris strains integrated two copies of BhCell-Xyl under AOX and GAP promoters. The pure recombinant BhCell-Xyl is a glycoprotein of 66 kDa, which is optimally active at 60 degrees C and pH 6.0 and 8.0. Glycosylated BhCell-Xyl exhibits higher thermostability than that of the native enzyme. The analysis of amino acids of BhCell-Xyl revealed that multiple factors are responsible for its thermostability. Kinetics and in silico analysis of the enzyme suggested that BhCell-Xyl has one active site for both endocellulase and endoxylanase activities. The BhCell-Xyl possesses a carbohydrate binding domain and saccharifies lignocellulosic agro-residues to xylo-oligosaccharides and cello-oligosaccharides, suggesting its potential application in generating fermentable sugars from renewable agro-residues for biofuel and fine chemical industries.</p></details><hr><h4>N-glycosylation converts non-glycoproteins into mannose receptor ligands and reveals antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo.</h4><p>C. Kreer et al., Oncotarget   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28036287>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>N-glycosylation is generally accepted to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens because of two main reasons. First, the attachment of glycans enables recognition by endocytic receptors like the mannose receptor (MR) and hence increased uptake by dendritic cells (DCs). Second, foreign glycans are postulated to be immunostimulatory and their recognition could induce DC activation. However, a direct comparison between the immunogenicity of N-glycosylated vs. de-glycosylated proteins in vivo and a direct effect of N-glycosylated antigens on the intrinsic capacity of DCs to activate T cells have not been assessed so far.To analyze whether enforced N-glycosylation is a suited strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of non-glycosylated antigens for vaccination studies, we targeted non-glycoproteins towards the MR by introduction of artificial N-glycosylation using the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (previously termed Pichia pastoris). We could demonstrate that the introduction of a single N-X-S/T motif was sufficient for efficient MR-binding and internalization. However, addition of N-glycosylated proteins neither influenced DC maturation nor their general capacity to activate T cells, pointing out that enforced N-glycosylation does not increase the immunogenicity of the antigen per se. Additionally, increased antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo after injection of N-glycosylated compared to de-glycosylated proteins were observed but this effect strongly depended on the epitope tested. A beneficial effect of N-glycosylation on antibody production could not be detected, which might be due to MR-cross-linking on DCs and to concomitant differences in IL-6 production by CD4+ T cells.These observations point out that the effect of N-glycosylation on antigen immunogenicity can vary between different antigens and therefore might have important implications for the development of vaccines using K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>A comparative study of glycerol and sorbitol as co-substrates in methanol-induced cultures of Pichia pastoris: temperature effect and scale-up simulation.</h4><p>J. Berrios et al., J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035480>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The production of recombinant proteins by Pichia pastoris under AOX1 promoter is usually performed using methanol together with either glycerol or sorbitol as co-substrate. Although both co-substrates have been widely used, comparative studies are scarce. In addition, these comparisons have been performed at different specific growth rate (micro) that it is well known that has an important effect on productivity. Thus, the effect of using these co-substrates on the production of Rhyzopus oryzae lipase (ROL) by P. pastoris was compared in continuous cultures growing at the same micro at either 22 or 30 degrees C. Results show that using glycerol as co-substrate led to higher volumetric productivities, and lower specific and volumetric methanol consumption rates. Scale-up simulation with 10-10,000 L bioreactor sizes indicated that glycerol produced the highest volumetric productivity of ROL with lower aeration requirements. Therefore, glycerol rises as a better option than sorbitol in ROL production.</p></details><hr><h4>Biotechnological exploitation of Tetrapisispora phaffii killer toxin: heterologous production in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris).</h4><p>R. Chessa et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28032192>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The use of natural antimicrobials from plants, animals and microorganisms to inhibit the growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms is becoming more frequent. This parallels the increased consumer interest towards consumption of minimally processed food and 'greener' food and beverage additives. Among the natural antimicrobials of microbial origin, the killer toxin produced by the yeast Tetrapisispora phaffii, known as Kpkt, appears to be a promising natural antimicrobial agent. Kpkt is a glycoprotein with beta-1,3-glucanase and killer activity, which induces ultrastructural modifications to the cell wall of yeast of the genera Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora and Zygosaccharomyces. Moreover, Kpkt maintains its killer activity in grape must for at least 14 days under winemaking conditions, thus suggesting its use against spoilage yeast in wine making and the sweet beverage industry. Here, the aim was to explore the possibility of high production of Kpkt for biotechnological exploitation. Molecular tools for heterologous production of Kpkt in Komagataella phaffii GS115 were developed, and two recombinant clones that produce up to 23 mg/L recombinant Kpkt (rKpkt) were obtained. Similar to native Kpkt, rKpkt has beta-glucanase and killer activities. Moreover, it shows a wider spectrum of action with respect to native Kpkt. This includes effects on Dekkera bruxellensis, a spoilage yeast of interest not only in wine making, but also for the biofuel industry, thus widening the potential applications of this rKpkt.</p></details><hr><h4>A capture method based on the VC1 domain reveals new binding properties of the human receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).</h4><p>G. Degani et al., Redox Biol 11 275 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28013188>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Advanced Glycation and Lipoxidation End products (AGEs and ALEs) are a heterogeneous class of compounds derived from the non-enzymatic glycation or protein adduction by lipoxidation break-down products. The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is involved in the progression of chronic diseases based on persistent inflammatory state and oxidative stress. RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and the inhibition of the interaction with its ligands or of the ligand accumulation have a potential therapeutic effect. The N-terminal domain of RAGE, the V domain, is the major site of AGEs binding and is stabilized by the adjacent C1 domain. In this study, we set up an affinity assay relying on the extremely specific biological interaction AGEs ligands have for the VC1 domain. A glycosylated form of VC1, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, was attached to magnetic beads and used as insoluble affinity matrix (VC1-resin). The VC1 interaction assay was employed to isolate specific VC1 binding partners from in vitro generated AGE-albumins and modifications were identified/localized by mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, this method also led to the isolation of ALEs produced by malondialdehyde treatment of albumins. Computational studies provided a rational-based interpretation of the contacts established by specific modified residues and amino acids of the V domain. The validation of VC1-resin in capturing AGE-albumins from complex biological mixtures such as plasma and milk, may lead to the identification of new RAGE ligands potentially involved in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses, independently of their structures or physical properties, and without the use of any covalent derivatization process. In addition, the method can be applied to the identification of antagonists of RAGE-ligand interaction.</p></details><hr><h4>Physicochemical characterization and immunological properties of Pichia pastoris based HPV16L1 and 18L1 virus like particles.</h4><p>G. Gupta, R. Glueck, N. Rishi, Biologicals   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012703>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There continues to be an urgent need for cost-effective prophylaxis for HPV-associated cancers in socio-economically underdeveloped nations. Presently HPV vaccines, which are commercially available, are adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLPs) expressed from various recombinant expression systems. They have been characterized by different methods as safe, pure, and potent HPV vaccine antigens. We cloned and expressed L1 proteins of HPV16 & 18 in Pichia pastoris and tested their immunogenicity. We observed that HPVL1 proteins (16L1 and 18L1) are expressed in Pichia pastoris at high levels. Critical physicochemical parameters of these HPV recombinant L1 proteins were characterized by SDS PAGE, western blotting, peptide mapping, glycosylation pattern, mass spectrometry, host cell DNA and protein analysis, electron microscopy, and immunogenicity analysis. These data establish a blueprint of HPV recombinant protein antigens for standardizing & developing an alternative high-quality, cost-effective vaccine for HPV as well as similar recombinant protein-based vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Rational design for the stability improvement of Armillariella tabescens beta-mannanase MAN47 based on N-glycosylation modification.</h4><p>W. Hu et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 97 82 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28010776>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>beta-Mannanase has been widely used in industries such as food and feed processing and thus has been a target enzyme for biotechnological development. In this study, we sought to improve the stability and protease resistance of a recombinant beta-mannanase, MAN47 from Armillariella tabescens, through rationally designed N-glycosylation. Based on homology modeling, molecular docking, secondary structure analysis and glycosylation feasibility analysis, an enhanced aromatic sequon sequence was introduced into specific MAN47 loop regions to facilitate N-glycosylation. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168, and their thermal stability, pH stability, trypsin resistance and pepsin resistance were determined. Two mutant MAN47 enzymes, g-123 and g-347, were glycosylated as expected when expressed in yeast, and their thermal stability, pH stability, and protease resistance were significantly improved compared to the wild-type enzyme. An enzyme with multiple stability characterizations has broad prospects in practical applications, and the rational design N-glycosylation strategy may have applications in simultaneously improving several properties of other biotechnological targets.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of a beta-glucosidase from the xylophagous cockroach Panesthia angustipennis spadica displaying high specific activity for cellobiose.</h4><p>Y. Li et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 97 104 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28010766>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A beta-glucosidase (BG), PaBG1b, from the xylophagous cockroach Panesthia angustipennis spadica was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, purified, and biochemically characterized. Post-translational modification and N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that the expression product was comprised of two polypeptides with different N-terminal sequences, presumably due to the presence of lysine-arginine (KR) sequence in the putative mature region. Substrate specificity analysis showed that PaBG1b hydrolyzed a broad range of substrates including cellohexaose, with the preference for aryl beta-d-fucosyl linkage and laminaribiose. Although the glucose tolerance of PaBG1b was moderate (Ki=200.3+/-1.1mM), PaBG1b demonstrated high specific activity and catalytic efficiency towards cellobiose with Vmax and kcat/Km values of 436.7+/-6.3U/mg and 109.8mM-1s-1, respectively. In addition, PaBG1b was not inhibited by cellobiose up to the highest concentration tested (100mM). Collectively, our work demonstrates that PaBG1b is a potentially valuable BG for commercial bioethanol production from cellulose.</p></details><hr><h4>Gene cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of a Coprinopsis cinerea endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanase.</h4><p>J. Wang, L. Kang, Z. Liu, S. Yuan, Fungal Biol 121 61 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28007217>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A gene coding endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanase (ENG16A) was cloned from Coprinopsis cinerea and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. ENG16A only acts on substrates containing beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds but not on substrates containing only beta-1,4- or beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds. Interestingly, compared to the activity of this enzyme towards carboxymethyl (CM)-pachyman containing only beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, its activity towards barley beta-glucan containing both beta-1,3-glycosidic and beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds was increased by 64.72 %,, its activity towards laminarin containing both beta-1,3-glycosidic and beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds was decreased by 50.83 %. In addition, ENG16A has a higher Km value and Vmax for barley beta-glucan than laminarin, which may be related to the fact that barley beta-glucan contains mainly beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds mixed with a few beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, whereas laminarin mainly contains beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds with a few beta-1,6-branched glucose residues. The adjacent beta-1,4-glycosidic bond promotes ENG16A to hydrolyse beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, leading to an increased Vmax; the nearby beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds inhibited its hydrolysis of beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, resulting in a decreased Vmax. This property is suggested to be related to the mechanism that C. cinerea uses to degrade and utilize hemicellulose in straw medium and to protect its cell wall during the mycelium growth stage.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of recombinant human epidermal growth factor in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Eissazadeh et al., Braz J Microbiol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27998673>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study was carried out to express human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) in Pichia pastoris GS115. For this aim, the hEGF gene was cloned into the pPIC9K expression vector, and then integrated into P. pastoris by electroporation. ELISA-based assay showed that the amount of hEGF secreted into the medium can be affected by the fermentation conditions especially by culture medium, pH and temperature. The best medium for the optimal hEGF production was BMMY buffered at a pH range of 6.0 and 7.0. The highest amount of hEGF with an average yield of 2.27mug/mL was obtained through an induction of the culture with 0.5% (v/v) methanol for 60h. The artificial neural network (ANN) analysis revealed that changes in both pH and temperature significantly affected the hEGF production with the pH change had slightly higher impact on hEGF production than variations in the temperature.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Paranosema (Antonospora) locustae hexokinase in lepidopteran, Sf9, cells is followed by accumulation of the microsporidian protein in insect cell nuclei.</h4><p>S.

Molecular mechanisms of the effects of this pathogen and other invertebrate microsporidia on host cells remain uncharacterized. Previously, we immunolocalized P. locustae hexokinase in nuclei of Locusta migratoria infected adipocytes. Here, the microsporidian protein was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and in lepidopteran Sf9 cells. During heterologous expression, P. locustae hexokinase was accumulated in the nuclei of insect cells but not in yeast cell nuclei. This confirms nuclear localization of hexokinase secreted by microsporidia into infected host cells and suggests convenient model for its further study.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural characterization of the alpha-mating factor prepro-peptide for secretion of recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Chahal et al., Gene   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27984193>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been used extensively for expressing recombinant proteins because it combines the ease of genetic manipulation, the ability to provide complex posttranslational modifications and the capacity for efficient protein secretion. The most successful and commonly used secretion signal leader in Pichia pastoris has been the alpha mating factor (MATalpha) prepro secretion signal. However, limitations exist as some proteins cannot be secreted efficiently, leading to strategies to enhance secretion efficiency by modifying the secretion signal leader. Based on a Jpred secondary structure prediction and knob-socket modeling of tertiary structure, numerous deletions and duplications of the MATalpha prepro leader were engineered to evaluate the correlation between predicted secondary structure and the secretion level of the reporters horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Candida antarctica lipase B. In addition, circular dichroism analyses were completed for the wild type and several mutant pro-peptides to evaluate actual differences in secondary structure. The results lead to a new model of MATalpha pro-peptide signal leader, which suggests that the N and C-termini of MATalpha pro-peptide need to be presented in a specific orientation for proper interaction with the cellular secretion machinery and for efficient protein secretion.</p></details><hr><h4>Synthetic Core Promoters as Universal Parts for Fine-Tuning Expression in Different Yeast Species.</h4><p>R. M. Portela et al., ACS Synth Biol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973777>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering experiments frequently require the fine-tuning of gene expression to balance and optimize protein levels of regulators or metabolic enzymes. A key concept of synthetic biology is the development of modular parts that can be used in different contexts. Here, we have applied a computational multifactor design approach to generate de novo synthetic core promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) for yeast cells. In contrast to upstream cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), core promoters are typically not subject to specific regulation, making them ideal engineering targets for gene expression fine-tuning. 112 synthetic core promoter sequences were designed on the basis of the sequence/function relationship of natural core promoters, nucleosome occupancy and the presence of short motifs. The synthetic core promoters were fused to the Pichia pastoris AOX1 CRM, and the resulting activity spanned more than a 200-fold range (0.3% to 70.6% of the wild type AOX1 level). The top-ten synthetic core promoters with highest activity were fused to six additional CRMs (three in P. pastoris and three in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Inducible CRM constructs showed significantly higher activity than constitutive CRMs, reaching up to 176% of natural core promoters. Comparing the activity of the same synthetic core promoters fused to different CRMs revealed high correlations only for CRMs within the same organism. These data suggest that modularity is maintained to some extent but only within the same organism. Due to the conserved role of eukaryotic core promoters, this rational design concept may be transferred to other organisms as a generic engineering tool.</p></details><hr><h4>Non-canonical integration events in Pichia pastoris encountered during standard transformation analysed with genome sequencing.</h4><p>J. P. Schwarzhans et al., Sci Rep 6 38952 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27958335>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The non-conventional yeast Pichia pastoris is a popular host for recombinant protein production in scientific research and industry. Typically, the expression cassette is integrated into the genome via homologous recombination. Due to unknown integration events, a large clonal variability is often encountered consisting of clones with different productivities as well as aberrant morphological or growth characteristics. In this study, we analysed several clones with abnormal colony morphology and discovered unpredicted integration events via whole genome sequencing. These include (i) the relocation of the locus targeted for replacement to another chromosome (ii) co-integration of DNA from the E. coli plasmid host and (iii) the disruption of untargeted genes affecting colony morphology. Most of these events have not been reported so far in literature and present challenges for genetic engineering approaches in this yeast. Especially, the presence and independent activity of E. coli DNA elements in P. pastoris is of concern. In our study, we provide a deeper insight into these events and their potential origins. Steps preventing or reducing the risk for these phenomena are proposed and will help scientists working on genetic engineering of P. pastoris or similar non-conventional yeast to better understand and control clonal variability.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression, characterization, and application of a phospholipase B from Fusarium oxysporum.</h4><p>L. Su et al., J Biotechnol 242 92 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940286>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, a gene encoding a putative lipase from Fusarium oxysporum was optimized via codon optimization and expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71. The gene product was identified as a phospholipase B (PLB). The engineered P. pastoris was further cultured in a 3.6-L bioreactor. After optimization of the induction conditions, this system produced 6.6mgmL-1 protein and 6503.8UmL-1 PLB activity in the culture medium. Efficient expression of this PLB in P. pastoris should reduce the costs of production and application. The purified enzyme, with a specific activity of 1170Umg-1, was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. The results of a degumming experiment performed using the recombinant PLB showed that the phosphorus content of a test oil was decreased from 75.88ppm to 3.3ppm in 2h under optimal reaction conditions. This study provides a basis for the industrial use of F. oxysporum PLB in oil degumming applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Kinase Screening in Pichia pastoris Identified Promising Targets Involved in Cell Growth and Alcohol Oxidase 1 Promoter (PAOX1) Regulation.</h4><p>W. Shen et al., PLoS One 11 e0167766 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27936065>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As one of the most commonly used eukaryotic recombinant protein expression systems, P. pastoris relies heavily on the AOX1 promoter (PAOX1), which is strongly induced by methanol but strictly repressed by glycerol and glucose. However, the complicated signaling pathways involved in PAOX1 regulation when supplemented with different carbon sources are poorly understood. Here we constructed a kinase deletion library in P. pastoris and identified 27 mutants which showed peculiar phenotypes in cell growth or PAOX1 regulation. We analyzed both annotations and possible functions of these 27 targets, and then focused on the MAP kinase Hog1. In order to locate its potential downstream components, we performed the phosphoproteome analysis on glycerol cultured WT and Deltahog1 strains and identified 157 differentially phosphorylated proteins. Our results identified important kinases involved in P. pastoris cell growth and PAOX1 regulation, which could serve as valuable targets for further mechanistic studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Elimination of N-glycosylation by site mutation further prolongs the half-life of IFN-alpha/Fc fusion proteins expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

Three different forms of IgG1 Fc fragments, including the wild type, aglycosylated homodimer and aglycosylated single chain, were each fused with IFN-alpha and designated as IFN-alpha/Fc-WT, IFN-alpha/Fc-MD, and IFN-alpha/Fc-SC, respectively. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and tested using antiviral and pharmacokinetic assays in comparison with the commercial pegylated-IFN-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha). The in vitro study demonstrated that IFN-alpha/Fc-SC has the highest antiviral activity, while IFN-alpha/Fc-WT and IFN-alpha/Fc-MD exhibited antiviral activities comparable to that of PEG-IFN-alpha. The in vivo pharmacokinetic assay showed that both IFN-alpha/Fc-WT and IFN-alpha/Fc-MD have a longer half-life than PEG-IFN-alpha in SD rats, but IFN-alpha/Fc-SC has the shortest half-life among them. Importantly, the circulating half-life of 68.3 h for IFN-alpha/Fc-MD was significantly longer than those of 38.2 h for IFN-alpha/Fc-WT and 22.2 h for PEG-IFN-alpha.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The results demonstrate that the elimination of N-glycosylation by mutation of putative N-glycosylation site further prolongs the half-life of the IFN-alpha/Fc fusion protein and could present an alternative strategy for extending the half-life of low-molecular-weight proteins expressed by P. pastoris for in vivo studies as well as for future clinical applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Characteristics and applications of recombinant thermostable amylopullulanase of Geobacillus thermoleovorans secreted by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Satyanarayana, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924363>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The 3'-deleted amylopullulanase gene from the extreme thermophile Geobacillus thermoleovorans (Gt-apuDeltaC) was expressed extracellularly in Pichia pastoris under both methanol-inducible AOX1 and constitutive GAP promoters. The expression of the gene (Gt-apuDeltaC) was higher under GAP promoter (36.2 U ml-1, alpha-amylase; 33.5 U ml-1, pullulanase) than that under AOX1 promoter (32.5 and 28.6 U ml-1). The heavily glycosylated Gt-apuDeltaC from the recombinant P. pastoris displays higher substrate specificity, thermal stability and starch saccharification efficiency than that expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme hydrolyses maltotriose and maltotetraose unlike that expressed in E. coli. The enzyme action on wheat bran liberates maltose and glucose without detectable amount(s) of maltooligosaccharides. The sugars released from wheat bran (glucose and maltose) could be fractionated by ultrafiltration, as confirmed by TLC and HPLC analysis. This is the first report on the production of recombinant amylopullulanase extracellularly in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Effect of Glycosylation on the Biocatalytic Properties of Hydroxynitrile Lyase from the Passion Fruit, Passiflora edulis: A Comparison of Natural and Recombinant Enzymes.</h4><p>A.

Cyanohydrins are important building blocks for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Thus, to enhance production yields of PeHNL for industrial applications, we cloned and expressed recombinant PeHNL in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris GS115 cells without a signal peptide sequence. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of N-glycosylation on enzyme stability and catalytic properties in microbial expression systems. PeHNL from leaves (PeHNL-N) and that expressed in P. pastoris (PeHNL-P) were glycosylated, whereas that expressed in E. coli (PeHNL-E) was not. The enzymes PeHNL-N and PeHNL-P showed much better thermostability, pH stability, and organic solvent tolerance than the deglycosylated enzyme PeHNL-E and the deglycosylated mutant N105Q from P. pastoris (PeHNL-P-N105Q). The glycosylated PeHNL-P also efficiently performed transcyanation of (R)-mandelonitrile with a 98 % enantiomeric excess in a biphasic system with diisopropyl ether. These data demonstrate the efficacy of these methods for improving enzyme expression and stability for industrial application through N-glycosylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as a chassis organism for polyketide synthesis via the full citrinin biosynthetic pathway.</h4><p>Y. Xue et al., J Biotechnol 242 64 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913218>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>With the rapid development of synthetic biology, exploring various chassis organisms has become necessary to improve the heterologous biosynthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals. In this study, we tested the potential of the industrial methylotrophic yeast strain Pichia pastoris for the heterologous synthesis of polyketides. A recombinant P. pastoris GS-pksCT-npgA carrying the Monascus purpureus citrinin polyketide synthase gene pksCT and the Aspergillus nidulans phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene npgA was constructed. Subsequently, a specific compound was isolated and identified as citrinin intermediate trimethylated pentaketide aldehyde. On account of the hypothetic functions of the genes in the citrinin gene cluster, mpl1 encoding serine hydrolase, mpl2 encoding oxygenase, and mpl4 encoding dehydrogenase were gradually expressed. Proteins were also normally expressed, but a new compound was undetected. Basing on the recently reported citrinin gene cluster in Monascus ruber, we obtained two other genes (mpl6 and mpl7) participating in citrinin biosynthesis by genome walking in M. purpureus. Then, we co-transformed intron-removed mpl6 and mpl7 into the P. pastoris strain carrying pksCT, npgA, mpl1, mpl2, and mpl4. All genes were activated by the methanol-induced AOX1 promoter, and a complete biosynthetic pathway of citrinin was assembled. Finally, citrinin was successfully produced under methanol induction in P. pastoris. These results prove that P. pastoris is a promising chassis organism for polyketide production.</p></details><hr><h4>A Simplified and Efficient Process for Insulin Production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

In this manuscript we describe improvements to key steps in the insulin production process in Pichia pastoris that reduce cost and time. The strategy for recovery and processing of human insulin precursor has been streamlined to two steps from bioreactor to the transpeptidation reaction. In the first step the insulin precursor secreted during the methanol induction phase is recovered directly from the culture broth using Tangential Flow Filtration with a Prostak module eliminating the laborious and time-consuming multi-step clarification, including centrifugation. In the second step the protein is applied at very high loadings on a cation exchange resin and eluted in a mixture of water and ethanol to obtain a concentrated insulin precursor, suitable for use directly in the transpeptidation reaction. Overall the yield from insulin precursor to human insulin was 51% and consisted of three purification chromatography steps. In addition we describe a method for recovery of the excess of H-Thr(tBu)-OtBu from the transpeptidation reaction mixture, one of the more costly reagents in the process, along with its successful reuse.</p></details><hr><h4>Recent advances of molecular toolbox construction expand Pichia pastoris in synthetic biology applications.</h4><p>Z.

The xylanases activity is hindered by high temperature and alkaline conditions with high enzyme production cost in the paper industry. Here, XynHB, an alkaline stable xylanase from Bacillus pumilus HBP8 was mutated at N188A to XynHBN188A. Expressed mutant in E. coli showed 1.5-fold higher xylanase activity than XynHB at 60 degrees C. The mutant expressed in Pichia pastoris was glycosylated, remained stable for 30 min at 60 degrees C. XynHBN188A optimized based on codon usage bias for P. pastoris (xynHBN188As) showed an increase of 39.5% enzyme activity. The strain Y16 forming the largest hydrolysis halo in the xylan plate was used in shake flask experiments produced an enzyme activity of 6,403 U/ml. The Y16 strain had 9 copies of the recombinant xynHBN188As gene in the genome revealed by qPCR. The enzymatic activity increased to 48,241 U/ml in a 5 L fermentor. Supplement of 15 U/g xylanase enhanced the brightness of paper products by 2% in bleaching experiment, and thereby improved the tensile strength and burst factor by 13% and 6.5%, respectively.

Here, 26 genes encoding beta-defensin-like peptides have been identified for the first time in Pelodiscus sinensis using database mining approach. Phylogenetic study confirmed that beta-defensins are fast evolving genes with high rates of sequence substitutions. The expression level of several selected genes in different tissues was examined by RT-PCR. Ps-BDs mainly adopt beta-strands and/or alpha-helix conformations homology modeled by Rosetta program. Further, Ps-BD2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using Ni-NTA column and RT-HPLC. As expected, the rPs-BD2 showed strong antimicrobial activity, but displayed a negligible hemolytic and cytotoxic activity on human erythrocytes and Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cells, respectively. Our results suggested that the Ps-BD2 was produced efficiently in P. pastoris expression system, which makes the large-scale use of rPs-BDs possible in the future clinical practice.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of a Talaromyces marneffei active phospholipase B expressed in a Pichia pastoris expression system.</h4><p>Y. He et al., Emerg Microbes Infect 5 e120 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876784>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Phospholipase B is a virulence factor for several clinically important pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, but its role in the thermally dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei remains unclear. Here, we provide the first report of the expression of a novel phospholipase gene, designated TmPlb1, from T. marneffei in the eukaryotic expression system of Pichia pastoris GS115. Sensitive real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that the expression of TmPlb1 increased 1.85-fold in the yeast phase compared with the mycelial phase. TmPlb1 contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 732 bp that encodes a protein of 243 amino acids. The conserved serine, aspartate and histidine catalytic triad and the G-X-S-X-G domain of TmPLB1 provide the structural basis for its molecular activity. The ORF of TmPlb1 was successfully cloned into a pPIC9K vector containing an alpha-mating factor secretion signal that allowed the secretory expression of TmPLB1 in P. pastoris. The heterologous protein expression began 12 h after methanol induction and peaked at 96 h. Through analysis with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western blotting and mass spectrometry, we confirmed that TmPLB1 was successfully expressed. Through Ni-affinity chromatography, TmPLB1 was highly purified, and its concentration reached 240.4 mg/L of culture medium. With specific substrates, the phospholipase A1 and phospholipase A2 activities of TmPLB1 were calculated to be 5.96 and 1.59 U/mg, respectively. The high purity and activity of the TmPLB1 obtained here lay a solid foundation for further investigation.</p></details><hr><h4>Catalytic efficiency and thermostability improvement of Suc2 invertase through rational site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>N. Mohandesi et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 96 14 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871374>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Engineering of invertases has come to attention because of increasing demand for possible applications of invertases in various industrial processes. Due to the known physicochemical properties, invertases from micro-organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying SUC2 gene are considered as primary models. To improve thermostability and catalytic efficiency of SUC2 invertase (SInv), six influential residues with Relative Solvent Accessibility<5% were selected through multiple-sequence alignments, molecular modelling, structural and computational analyses. Consequently, SInv and 5 mutants including three mutants with single point substitution [Mut1=P152V, Mut2=S85V and Mut3=K153F)], one mutant with two points [Mut4=S305V-N463V] and one mutant with three points [Mut5=S85V-K153F-T271V] were developed via site-directed mutagenesis and produced using Pichia pastoris as the host. Physicochemical studies on these enzymes indicated that the selected amino acids which were located in the active site region mainly influenced catalytic efficiency. The best improvement belonged to Mut1 (54% increase in Kcat/Km) and Mut3 exhibited the worst effect (90% increase in Km). These results suggest that Pro152 and Lys153 play key role in preparation of the right substrate lodging in the active site of SInv. The best thermostability improvement (16%) was observed for Mut4 in which two hydrophilic residues located on the loops, far from the active site, were replaced by Valines. These results suggest that tactful simultaneous substitution of influential hydrophilic residues in both active site region and peripheral loops with hydrophobic amino acids could result in more thermostable invertases with enhanced catalytic efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient production of recombinant glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus type 2 in Pichia pastoris and its protective efficacy against viral challenge in mice.</h4><p>M.

However, there are no approved vaccines available to prevent HSV-2 infection. The glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-2 is the most important candidate antigen for vaccine development. In this study, a truncated form of gD (codons 1-340, gD1-340) was produced as a secretory protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant gD1-340 with a His6 tag was purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography. Mice immunized with the recombinant gD1-340 developed high levels of antigen-specific antibody responses with HSV-2 neutralizing activity. Immunization with the recombinant gD1-340 conferred significant protection against lethal HSV-2 infection in mice. Moreover, measurement of the secretion of gD1-340-specific cytokines demonstrated that the recombinant gD1-340 induced mixed Th1/Th2 cellular immune responses. These findings indicated that P. pastoris-derived gD1-340 represents a promising HSV-2 vaccine candidate with strong immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy.</p></details><hr><h4>Combined 13C-assisted metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis reveals the impacts of glutamate on the central metabolism of high beta-galactosidase-producing Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>P.

On the other hand, proteases are broadly used in industrial applications and resemble promising drug candidates. Bromelain is an herbal drug that is medicinally used for treatment of oedematous swellings and inflammatory conditions and consists in large part of proteolytic enzymes. Even though various experiments underline the requirement of active cysteine proteases for biological activity, so far no investigation succeeded to clearly clarify the pharmacological mode of action of bromelain. The potential role of proteases themselves and other molecules of this multi-component extract currently remain largely unknown or ill defined. Here, we set out to express several bromelain cysteine proteases as well as a bromelain inhibitor molecule in order to gain defined molecular entities for subsequent studies. After cloning the genes from its natural source Ananas comosus (pineapple plant) into Pichia pastoris and subsequent fermentation and purification, we obtained active protease and inhibitor molecules which were subsequently biochemically characterized. Employing purified bromelain fractions paves the way for further elucidation of pharmacological activities of this natural product. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The two (His)6-tagged proteins were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography and obtained in quantities of 12 and 15 mg L-1 of culture volume, respectively. Glycosylation sites were identified for the native and for the enzymatically deglycosylated proteins by mass spectrometry, confirming five to six of the seven predicted glycosylation sites in the NxS/T sequence context. The predominant glycan structure was Man5GlcNAc2 with, however, a significant contribution of Man4-10GlcNAc2. Both dirigent proteins (DIRs) mediated the formation of (+)-gossypol by atropselective coupling of hemigossypol radicals. Similar to previously characterized DIRs, GbDIR2 and GhDIR3 lacked oxidizing activity and depended on an oxidizing system (laccase/O2) for the generation of substrate radicals. In contrast to DIRs involved in the biosynthesis of lignans, glycosylation was not essential for function. Quantitative enzymatic deglycosylation yielded active GbDIR2 and GhDIR3 in excellent purity. The described fermentation process in combination with enzymatic deglycosylation will pave the way for mechanistic and structural studies and, eventually, the application of cotton DIRs in a biomimetic approach towards atropselective biaryl synthesis.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and Characterization of a Novel Antifungal Exo-beta-1,3-glucanase from Chaetomium cupreum.</h4><p>C. Jiang et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854040>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A novel beta-1,3-glucanase gene, designated Ccglu17A, was cloned from the biological control fungus Chaetomium cupreum Ame. Its 1626-bp open reading frame encoded 541 amino acids. The corresponding amino acid sequence showed highest identity (67 %) with a glycoside hydrolase family 17 beta-1,3-glucanase from Chaetomium globosum. The recombinant protein Ccglu17A was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity with 10.1-fold purification and 47.8 % recovery yield. The protein's molecular mass was approximately 65 kDa, and its maximum activity appeared at pH 5.0 and temperature 45 degrees C. Heavy metal ions Fe2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ag+, and Hg2+ had inhibitory effects on Ccglu17A, but Ba2+ promoted the enzyme's activity. Ccglu17A exhibited high substrate specificity, almost exclusively catalyzing beta-1,3-glycosidic bond cleavage in various polysaccharoses to liberate glucose. The enzyme had a Km of 2.84 mg/mL and Vmax of 10.7 mumol glucose/min/mg protein for laminarin degradation under optimal conditions. Ccglu17A was an exoglucanase with transglycosylation activity based on its hydrolytic properties. It showed potential antifungal activity with a degradative effect on cell walls and inhibitory action against the germination of pathogenic fungus. In conclusion, Ccglu17A is the first functional exo-1,3-beta-glucanase to be identified from C. cupreum and has potential applicability in industry and agriculture.</p></details><hr><h4>Chicken IgY Fc Linked to Bordetella avium ompA and Taishan Pinus massoniana Pollen Polysaccharide Adjuvant Enhances Macrophage Function and Specific Immune Responses.</h4><p>W.

Mammalian IgG Fc fusion exhibits improved antigen-induced immune responses by providing aggregates with high avidity for the IgG Fc receptor and salvaging the antigenic portion from endosomal degradation. However, whether the linked chicken IgY Fc fragment shares similar characteristics to mammalian IgG Fc remains unclear. In this study, we linked the chicken IgY Fc gene to the outer membrane protein A (ompA) of Bordetella avium through overlapping PCR. The fusion gene was cloned into the pPIC9 plasmid to construct the recombinant Pichia pastoris transformant expressing the ompA-Fc fusion protein. The effects of the linked Fc on macrophage vitality, activity, efficiency of antigen processing, and immune responses induced by the fused ompA were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), an immunomodulator, on chicken macrophage activation was evaluated. TPPPS was also used as an adjuvant to investigate its immunomodulatory effect on immunoresponses induced by the fused ompA-Fc in chickens. The pinocytosis, phagocytosis, secretion of nitric oxide and TNF-alpha, and MHC-II molecular expression of the macrophages treated with the fused ompA-Fc were significantly higher than those of the macrophages treated with ompA alone. The addition of TPPPS to the fused ompA-Fc further enhanced macrophage functions. The fused ompA-Fc elicited higher antigen-specific immune responses and protective efficacy compared with ompA alone. Moreover, the fused ompA-Fc conferred higher serum antibody titers, serum IL-2 and IL-4 concentrations, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte transformation rate, and protection rate compared with ompA alone. Notably, the prepared TPPPS adjuvant ompA-Fc vaccines induced high immune responses and protection rate. The linked Fc and TPPPS adjuvant can remarkably enhance macrophage functions and specific immune responses. This study provides new perspectives to improve the immune effects of subunit vaccines for prevention of poultry diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Matchout deuterium labelling of proteins for small-angle neutron scattering studies using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems and high cell-density cultures.</h4><p>O. Dunne et al., Eur Biophys J   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27844110>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a powerful technique for the characterisation of macromolecular structures and interactions. Its main advantage over other solution state approaches is the ability to use D2O/H2O solvent contrast variation to selectively match out specific parts of a multi-component system. While proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids are readily distinguished in this way, it is not possible to locate different parts of a protein-protein system without the introduction of additional contrast by selective deuteration. Here, we describe new methods by which 'matchout labelled' proteins can be produced using Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris expression systems in high cell-density cultures. The method is designed to produce protein that has a scattering length density that is very close to that of 100% D2O, providing clear contrast when used with hydrogenated partner proteins in a complex. This allows the production of a single sample system for which SANS measurements at different solvent contrasts can be used to distinguish and model the hydrogenated component, the deuterated component, and the whole complex. The approach, which has significant cost advantages, has been extensively tested for both types of expression system.</p></details><hr><h4>A recombinant multi-antigen vaccine formulation containing Babesia bovis merozoite surface antigens MSA-2a1, MSA-2b and MSA-2c elicits invasion-inhibitory antibodies and IFN-gamma producing cells.</h4><p>A.

The vaccines currently available are based on attenuated parasites, which are difficult to produce, and are only recommended for use in bovines under one year of age. When used in older animals, these vaccines may cause life-threatening clinical symptoms and eventually death. The development of a multi-subunit recombinant vaccine against B. bovis would be attractive from an economic standpoint and, most importantly, could be recommended for animals of any age.

A vaccine formulation was obtained by emulsifying a mixture of the three peptides with the adjuvant Montanide ISA 720, which elicited high IgG antibody titers against each of the above antigens. IgG antibodies generated against each MSA-antigen recognized merozoites and significantly inhibited the invasion of bovine erythrocytes. Cellular immune responses were also detected, which were characterized by splenic and lymph node CD4+ T cells producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha upon stimulation with the antigens MSA-2a1 or MSA-2c.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> These data strongly suggest the high protective potential of the presented formulation, and we propose that it could be tested in vaccination trials of bovines challenged with B. bovis.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of construct design and fermentation strategy for the production of bioactive ATF-SAP, a saporin based anti-tumoral uPAR-targeted chimera.</h4><p>A.

However, unlike PEPT1 (SLC15A1), there is little information about species differences in the transport of PEPT2-mediated substrates. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PEPT2 exhibited a species-dependent uptake of glycylsarcosine (GlySar) and cefadroxil using yeast Pichia pastoris cells expressing the cDNAs from human, mouse and rat. In such a system, the functional activity of PEPT2 was evaluated with [3H]GlySar as a function of time, pH, substrate concentration and specificity, and with [3H]cefadroxil as a function of concentration. We observed that the uptake of GlySar was pH-dependent with an optimal uptake at pH 6.5 for all three species. Moreover, GlySar showed saturable uptake kinetics, with Km values in human (150.6 microM) > mouse (42.8 microM) rat (36.0 microM). The PEPT2-mediated uptake of GlySar in yeast transformants was specific, being inhibited by di/tripeptides and peptide-like drugs, but not by amino acids and non-substrate compounds. Cefadroxil also showed a saturable uptake profile in all three species, with Km values in human (150.8 muM) > mouse (15.6 muM) rat (11.9 muM). These findings demonstrated that the PEPT2-mediated uptake of GlySar and cefadroxil was specific, species dependent and saturable. Further, based on Km values, mice appeared similar to rats but both were less than optimal as animal models to evaluate the renal reabsorption and pharmacokinetics of peptides and peptide-like drugs in human.</p></details><hr><h4>cDNA Isolation and Functional Characterization of UDP-d-glucuronic Acid 4-Epimerase Family from Ornithogalum caudatum.</h4><p>S. Yin et al., Molecules 21  (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27834878>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>d-Galacturonic acid (GalA) is an important component of GalA-containing polysaccharides in Ornithogalum caudatum. The incorporation of GalA into these polysaccharides from UDP-d-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA) was reasonably known. However, the cDNAs involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-GalA were still unknown. In the present investigation, one candidate UDP-d-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase (UGlcAE) family with three members was isolated from O. caudatum based on RNA-Seq data. Bioinformatics analyses indicated all of the three isoforms, designated as OcUGlcAE1~3, were members of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) and shared two conserved motifs. The three full-length cDNAs were then transformed to Pichia pastoris GS115 for heterologous expression. Data revealed both the supernatant and microsomal fractions from the recombinant P. pastoris expressing OcUGlcAE3 can interconvert UDP-GalA and UDP-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), while the other two OcUGlcAEs had no activity on UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalA. Furthermore, expression analyses of the three epimerases in varied tissues of O. caudatum were performed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results indicated OcUGlcAE3, together with the other two OcUGlcAE-like genes, was root-specific, displaying highest expression in roots. OcUGlcAE3 was UDP-d-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase and thus deemed to be involved in the biosynthesis of root polysaccharides. Moreover, OcUGlcAE3 was proposed to be environmentally induced.</p></details><hr><h4>Neutralization of TNFalpha in tumor with a novel nanobody potentiates paclitaxel-therapy and inhibits metastasis in breast cancer.</h4><p>X. Ji et al., Cancer Lett 386 24 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832973>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Metastatic disease is the major cause of death from cancer, and immunotherapy and chemotherapy have had limited success in reversing its progression. Researchers have suggested that inflammatory factors in the tumor environment can promote cancer invasion and metastasis, stimulating cancer progression. Thus, novel strategies that target cytokines and modulate the tumor microenvironment may emerge as important approaches for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specific neutralization of pathogenic TNF signaling using a TNFalpha antibody has gained increasing attention. Considering this, a selective human TNFalpha neutralized antibody was generated based on nanobody technology. A TNFalpha-specific nanobody was produced in Pichia pastoris with a molecular mass of 15 kDa and affinity constant of 2.05 nM. In the proliferation experiment, the TNFalpha nanobody could inhibit the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 induced by hTNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. In the microinvasion model, the TNFalpha nanobody could inhibit the migration of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 induced by hTNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. Drug administration of the combination of paclitaxel with the TNFalpha nanobody in vivo significantly enhanced the efficacy against 4T-1 breast tumor proliferation and lung metastasis; meanwhile, E-cadherin tumor epithelial marker expression was upregulated, supporting the anti-tumor therapeutic relevance of paclitaxel and the TNFalpha nanobody on EMT. This study highlights the importance of neutralizing low TNFalpha levels in the tumor microenvironment to sensitize the chemotherapeutic response, which has attractive potential for clinical applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of the fermentation and downstream processes for human enterokinase production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K. Melicherova et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27826720>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Enterokinase is one of the most frequently used enzymes for the removal of affinity tags from target recombinant proteins. In this study, several fermentation strategies were assayed for the production of human enterokinase in Pichia pastoris under constitutive GAP promoter. Two of them with controlled specific growth rate during whole cultivation showed a very low enterokinase activity, under 1 U/ml, of the fermentation medium. On the contrary, the combined fermentation with a maximum specific growth rate at the initial phase of the fermentation and stationary-like phase during the rest of the fermentation showed a significant accumulation of the enterokinase in the medium, which counted up to 1400 U/ml. Lower cultivation temperature had a negative impact on the enzyme accumulation during this fermentation strategy. Downstream processes were focused on buffer environment optimization directly after cultivation, as at this time, the most amount of the activity is eliminated by endogenous proteases. Slightly positive effect on enzyme activity in the medium had an addition of liquid storage solution of EDTA and KOH to adjust pH to 8 and molarity of the EDTA to 50 mM. During the purification process, a significant amount of the enzyme was detected to be lost, which counted up to 90%. The purified enzyme, enterokinase, kept quality standard of the published enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of a ZEN-detoxifying gene by codon optimization and biobrick in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Xiang et al., Microbiol Res 193 48 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27825486>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) can be degraded by a lactone hydrolase ZHD, which was derived from Gliocladium roseum. Here, based on the native ZHD encoding gene zhd101, a codon optimized zhd gene was synthesized, which was used for high expression of ZHD in Pichia pastoris GS115. Meanwhile, to further improve the expression of recombinant ZHD, the plasmids containing 1 to 4 copies of the zhd expression cassette were constructed, respectively, using the biobrick method. The protein expression in the recombinant P. pastoris X3c, which was transformed with the plasmid containing 3 copies of zhd expression cassette, was the highest. In addition, the enzymatic activity of ZHD against ZEN was defined for the first time based on a standard curve of peak area vs ZEN concentration. The ZEN degradation activity of ZHD from shake flask fermentation was calculated as 22.5U/mL with the specific activity of 4976.5U/mg. Furthermore, the high-density fermentation of P. pastoris X3c strain was also performed in 5L fermenter. The maximum enzyme activity of the supernatant was 150.1U/mL, which were 6.7-fold higher than that of the shake flask fermentation.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Dengue Virus 4 Envelope Glycoprotein Virus-Like Particles Derived from Pichia pastoris are Capable of Eliciting Homotypic Domain III-Directed Neutralizing Antibodies.</h4><p>N.

Reportedly, there has been a 2-fold increase in dengue cases every decade. An efficacious tetravalent vaccine, which can provide long-term immunity against all four serotypes in all target populations, is still unavailable. Despite the progress being made in the live virus-based dengue vaccines, the World Health Organization strongly recommends the development of alternative approaches for safe, affordable, and efficacious dengue vaccine candidates. We have explored virus-like particles (VLPs)-based nonreplicating subunit vaccine approach and have developed recombinant envelope ectodomains of DENV-1, 2, and 3 expressed in Pichia pastoris These self-assembled into VLPs without pre-membrane (prM) protein, which limits the generation of enhancing antibodies, and elicited type-specific neutralizing antibodies against the respective serotype. Encouraged by these results, we have extended this work further by developing P. pastoris-expressed DENV-4 ectodomain (DENV-4 E) in this study, which was found to be glycosylated and assembled into spherical VLPs without prM, and displayed critical neutralizing epitopes on its surface. These VLPs were found to be immunogenic in mice and elicited DENV-4-specific neutralizing antibodies, which were predominantly directed against envelope domain III, implicated in host-receptor recognition and virus entry. These observations underscore the potential of VLP-based nonreplicative vaccine approach as a means to develop a safe, efficacious, and tetravalent dengue subunit vaccine. This work paves the way for the evaluation of a DENV E-based tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, as an alternative to live virus-based dengue vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor expression in Pichia pastoris through fusion with human serum albumin.</h4><p>M.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a hematopoietic growth factor and is clinically used against neutropenia. Enhanced expression and stability of G-CSF were achieved in Pichia pastoris by the way of constructing a fusion protein with human serum albumin (HSA). The strategy involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fragments corresponding to codon-optimized G-CSF and domain 3 of HSA. Overlapping PCR was used to obtain the full-length fused gene (1,184 bp) with a 15-bp linker sequence comprising of 4 Gly and 1 Ser residues. Extracellular expression was carried out downstream of alpha-factor secretion signal sequence under the control of alcohol oxidase 1 promoter using pPICZalphaB. Excreted protein in the range of 110-380 mg L-1 was observed among the transformants. Effect of aeration and temperature was investigated in one of the transformants (35) overexpressing fusion protein and levels of G-CSF enhanced by 1.8-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively. Assay of biological activity indicated the fusion protein to retain similar cell proliferation activity as the commercial G-CSF preparation.</p></details><hr><h4>High-Level Expression of a Biologically Active Staphylokinase in Pichia Pastoris.</h4><p>H.

SAK variant of SAKsmall ef, CyrillicC was expressed in Pichia pastoris strains KM71H and GS115. The codon adaptation index of SAK was improved from 0.75 to 0.89. The expression of recombinant SAK (rSAK) reached to its maximum (310 mg/L of the culture medium) after 48 h stimulation with 3% methanol and remained steady until day 5. The maximum activity of the enzyme was at pH 8.6 and 37 degrees C. It was highly active at temperatures 20-37 degrees C and pH ranges of 6.8-9 (relative residual activity more than 80%). It was determined that rSAK was 73.8% of the total proteins secreted by P. pastoris KM71H into the culture media. The specific activities of rSAK was measured as 9002 U/mg, and 21042 U/mg for the non-purified and purified proteins, respectively. The quantity of the purified protein (>99% purity) was 720 microg/ml with a purification factor of 2.34. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 22 and 18.6 kDa. It was concluded that P. pastoris is a proper host for expression of biologically active and endotoxin-free rSAK due to its high expression and low protein impurity in culture supernatant.</p></details><hr><h4>Is Pichia pastoris a realistic platform for industrial production of recombinant human interferon gamma?</h4><p>A.

Efficient expression of hIFNgamma has been reported once for Pichia pastoris (Wang et al., 2014) - a proven heterologous expression system. This study investigated hIFNgamma expression in P. pastoris replicating the previous study and expanding by using four different strains (X33: wild type; GS115: HIS-Mut+; KM71</p><p><strong>H:</strong> Arg+, Mut- and CBS7435: MutS) and three different vectors (pPICZalphaA, pPIC9 and pPpT4alphaS). In addition, the native sequence (NS) and two codon-optimised sequences (COS1 and COS2) for P. pastoris were used. Methanol induction yielded no expression/secretion of hIFNgamma in X33, highest levels were recorded for CBS7435: MutS ( approximately 16 mug. L-1). mRNA copy number calculations acquired from RT-qPCR for GS115-pPIC9-COS1 proved low abundance of mRNA. A 10-fold increase in expression of hIFNgamma was achieved by lowering the minimal free energy of the mRNA and 100-fold by MutS phenotypes, substantially lower than reported by Wang et al. (2014). We conclude that commercial production of low cost, eukaryotic recombinant hIFNgamma is not an economically viable in P. pastoris. Further research is required to unravel the cause of low expression in P. pastoris to achieve economic viability.</p></details><hr><h4>Lectin I from Bauhinia variegata (BVL-I) expressed by Pichia pastoris inhibits initial adhesion of oral bacteria in vitro.</h4><p>G.

Bauhinia variegata lectin I (BVL-I) is a Gal/GalNAc-specific, single-chain lectin isolated from Bauhinia variegata seeds that has been implicated in the inhibition of bacterial adhesion and the healing of damaged skin. Since the source of the native protein (nBVL) is limited, this study aimed to produce recombinant BVL-I in Pichia pastoris (rBVL-Ip). The coding sequence for BVL-I containing preferential codons for P. pastoris was cloned into the pPICZalphaB plasmid. A single expressing clone was selected and fermented, resulting in the secretion and glycosylation of the protein. Fed-batch fermentation in 7L-scale was performed, and the recombinant lectin was purified from culture supernatant, resulting in a yield of 1.5mg/L culture. Further, rBVL-Ip was compared to nBVL and its recombinant version expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (rBVL-Ie). Although it was expressed as a monomer, rBVL-Ip retained its biological activity since it was able to impair the initial adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguinis in an in vitro model of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion. In summary, rBVL-Ip produced in Pichia pastoris represents a viable alternative to large-scale production, encouraging further biological application studies with this lectin.</p></details><hr><h4>An Acid-Adapted Endo-alpha-1,5-L-arabinanase for Pectin Releasing.</h4><p>C.

Y702 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme was named AbnC702 with 20 U/mg of endo-arabinanase activity toward linear alpha-1,5-L-arabinan. The optimal pH and temperature of AbnC702 were 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The recombinant AbnC702 was highly stable at pH 5.0-7.0 and 50 degrees C. It could retain about 72.3 % of maximum specific activity at pH 5.0 after incubation for 2.5 h, which indicated AbnC702 was an acid-adapted enzyme. The K m and V max values were 24.8 +/- 4.7 mg/ml and 88.5 +/- 5.6 U/mg, respectively. A three-dimensional structure of AbnC702 was made by homology modeling, and the counting of acidic/basic amino residues within the region of 10 A around the active site, as well the hydrogen bonds within the area of 5 A around the active site, might theoretically interpret the acid adaptability of AbnC702. Analysis of hydrolysis products by thin layer chromatography (TLC) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) verified that the recombinant AbnC702 was an endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinanase, which yielded arabinobiose and arabinotriose as major products. AbnC702 was applied in pectin extraction from apple pomace with synergistic action of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase.</p></details><hr><h4>Overcoming difficulties on synthesis of cardiac troponin-I.</h4><p>S.

To produce the protein efficiently, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris systems were used. Initial trials for the expression in E. coli were not successful, although different expression vectors with different promoters were tested. This led us to use P. pastoris for the expression. After several trials with two different expression strains of P. pastoris, it was concluded that P. pastoris was also not an optimal expression host for cTnI. Comprehensive analysis of the expression systems indicated that an efficient expression is only possible when the gene is optimized for expression in E. coli. For this purpose, the gene was optimized in-silico, but edited manually afterwards. It was synthesized and cloned into pQE-2 vector. Expression was performed using routine experimental conditions. Thus, cTnI could be efficiently expressed from the optimized gene in E. coli. The expression and purification were practical and may be used for commercial purposes since a total yield of 25microg highly pure protein per milliliter of culture could be obtained. The protein was in its ready-to-use form for many biological applications, including as a standard in diagnostic tests and an antigen for antibody production.</p></details><hr><h4>Regulating unfolded protein response activator HAC1p for production of thermostable raw-starch hydrolyzing alpha-amylase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Huang et al., Bioprocess Biosyst Eng   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27796570>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolded protein response (UPR) usually happens when expressing heterologous proteins in high level, which may help cells to facilitate protein processing. Here, we evaluated the effects of the UPR activator HAC1p on a raw-starch hydrolyzing alpha-amylase (Gs4j-amyA), so as to improve heterologous production of the enzyme in Pichia pastoris. The gene (amyA) encoding Gs4j-amyA was first codon-optimized and expressed in P. pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. A high gene dosage (12 copies) of amyA facilitated amylase expression which produced an enzyme activity of 305 U/ml. A spliced HAC1 encoding an UPR activator HAC1p was then co-expressed and the dosage effects of HAC1 on amylase expression was investigated. Six copies of HAC1 driven by AOX1 promoter produced a high amylase activity of 2200 U/ml, further increasing by 621%. However, excessive gene dosages driven by the same promoter led to a titration effect of its transcription factors and decreased the amount of amyA transcripts. Thus, constitutive expression of HAC1 by GAP promotor was further involved and Gs4j-amyA activity reached 3700 U/ml finally, which was further increased by 68.2%. Moreover, Gs4j-amyA was glycosylated in P. pastoris which generated higher enzyme activity than that in E. coli. Generally, regulating HAC1p expression by different strategies enhanced amylase production by 11.1 folds, indicating a reference for expression of other proteins in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant exochitinase of the thermophilic mould Myceliopthora thermophila BJA: Characteristics and utility in generating N-acetyl glucosamine and in biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi.</h4><p>A.

To produce high enzyme titres, reduce fermentation time and overcome the need for induction, this enzyme has been heterologously expressed under GAP promoter in the GRAS yeast, Pichia pastoris. The production medium supplemented with the permeabilizing agent Tween-20 supported two-fold higher rMtChit production (5.5 x 103 U L-1 ). The consensus sequences S(132)xG(133)G(134) and D(168)xxD(171)xD(173)xE(175) in the enzyme have been found to represent the substrate binding and catalytic sites, respectively. The rMtChit, purified to homogeneity by a two-step purification strategy, is a monomeric glycoprotein of approximately 48 kDa, which is optimally active at 55 degrees C and pH 5.0. The enzyme is thermostable with t1/2 values of 113 and 48 min at 65 and 75 degrees C, respectively. Kinetic parameters Km , Vmax , kcat , and kcat /Km of the enzyme are 4.655 mg mL-1 , 34.246 nmol mg-1 s-1 , 3.425 x 106 min-1 , and 1.36 x 10-6 mg mL-1 min-1 , respectively. rMtChit is an unique exochitinase, since its action on chitin liberates N-acetylglucosamine NAG. The enzyme inhibits the growth of phytopathogenic fungi like Fusarium oxysporum and Curvularia lunata, therefore, this finds application as biofungicide at high temperatures during summer in tropics.

To check the influence of the expression on interfacial properties of FSL and to study kinetic properties of FSL2, interfacial parameters of FSL2, native FSL, untagged recombinant and tagged recombinant forms of FSL were compared using the monomolecular film technique. Kinetic study on the dependence of the stereoselectivity of these lipases on the surface pressure was performed using three dicaprin isomers spread in the form of monomolecular films at the air-water interface. The FSL2 seems to have an important penetration power with a preference for adjacent ester groups and the heterologous expression accompanied or not with the N-His-tag extension on the FSL were found to modify the pressure preference and increase the catalytic hydrolysis rate of three dicaprin isomers. The heterologous expression was found to preserve the FSL regioselectivity without affecting its stereospecificity at high and low surface pressure. The evaluation of the recombinant expression Effects on Catalysis (REC), the N-Tag Effects on Catalysis (TEC), and the N-Tag and Recombinant expression Effects on Catalysis (TREC) showed that the heterologous expression was more efficient than the presence of the N-terminal tag extension on the FSL.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression, purification and antimicrobial activity of a novel antimicrobial peptide PaDef in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

In this study, an N-terminal 6 x His tagged recombinant PaDef (rPaDef) with a molecular weight of 7.5 KDa, for the first time, was expressed as a secreted peptide in Pichia pastoris. The optimal culture condition for rPaDef expression was determined to be incubation with 1.5% methanol for 72 h at 28 degrees C under pH 6.0. Under this condition, the amount of the rPaDef accumulation reached as high as 79.6 mug per 1 ml of culture medium. Once the rPaDef peptide was purified to reach a 95.7% purity using one-step nickel affinity chromatography, its strong and concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity was detected to be against a broad-spectrum of bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The growth of these bacterial pathogens was almost completely inhibited when the rPaDef peptide was at a concentration of as low as 90 mug/ml. In summary, our data showed that rPaDef derived from Mexican avocado fruit can be expressed and secreted efficiently when P. pastoris was used as a cell factory. This is the first report on heterologous expression of PaDef in P. pastoris and the approach described holds great promise for antibacterial drug development.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of the catalytic performance of a hyperthermostable GH10 xylanase from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802.</h4><p>X.

Purified recombinant TlXyn10A was acidic and hyperthermophilic, and retained stable over the pH range of 2.0-6.0 and at 90 degrees C. Sequence analysis of TlXyn10A identified seven residues probably involved in substrate contacting. Three mutants (TlXyn10A_P, _N and _C) were then constructed by substituting some or all of the residues with corresponding ones of hyperthermal Xyl10C from Bispora sp. MEY-1. TlXyn10A_P with mutations at subsites +2 to +4 exhibited improved specific activity (by 0.44-fold) and pH stability (2.0-10.0). Molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that mutations E229I and F232E probably weaken the substrate affinity at subsites +3 to +4, and G149D may introduce a new hydrogen bond. These modifications altogether account for the improved performance of TlXyn10A_P. Moreover, TlXyn10A_P was able to hydrolyze wheat straw persistently, and has the application potentials in various industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioprocess for the production of recombinant HAP phytase of the thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile and its structural and biochemical characteristics.</h4><p>A.

Low extracellular phytase production by the mold is a major bottleneck for its application on a commercial scale. We have successfully overcome this problem by constitutive secretary expression of codon optimized rStPhy under glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter in Pichia pastoris. A approximately 41-fold improvement in rStPhy production has been achieved. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra revealed that rStPhy is composed of 26.65% alpha-helices, 5.26% beta-sheets and 68.09% random coils at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C, the optima for the enzyme activity. The melting temperature (Tm) of the enzyme is approximately 73 degrees C. The 3D structure of rStPhy displayed characteristic signature sequences (RHGXRXP and HD) of HAP phytase. The catalytically important amino acids (Arg74, His75, Arg78, His368 and Asp369) were identified by docking and site directed mutagenesis. Fluorescence quenching by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CsCl exposed tryptophan residues surrounded by negative charges, which play a key role in maintaining structural integrity of rStPhy.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory expression of bovine herpesvirus type 1/5 glycoprotein E in Pichia pastoris for the differential diagnosis of vaccinated or infected cattle.</h4><p>B.

The DIVA (Differentiation of Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy, using marker vaccines based on gE-negative BoHV strains, allows the identification of vaccinated or infected animals in immunoassays designed to detect anti-gE antibodies. In this study a codon optimized synthetic sequence of gE containing highly conserved regions from BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 was expressed in Pichia pastoris. Following expression, the recombinant gE (rgE) was secreted and purified from the culture medium. The rgE was identified by Western blotting (WB) using sera from cattle naturally infected with BoHV-1 and/or BoHV-5, or sera from bovines experimentally infected with wild-type BoHV-5. Sera collected from cattle vaccinated with a BoHV-5 gI/gE/US9 marker vaccine failed to recognise rgE. Expression of rgE, based on a sequence containing highly conserved regions from BoHV-1 and BoHV-5, in P. pastoris enabled the production of large quantities of rgE suitable for use in immunoassays for the differentiation vaccinated or infected cattle.</p></details><hr><h4>Selective Assembly of Na,K-ATPase alpha2beta2 Heterodimers in the Heart: DISTINCT FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES AND ISOFORM-SELECTIVE INHIBITORS.</h4><p>M. Habeck et al., J Biol Chem 291 23159 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27624940>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Na,K-ATPase alpha2 subunit plays a key role in cardiac muscle contraction by regulating intracellular Ca2+, whereas alpha1 has a more conventional role of maintaining ion homeostasis. The beta subunit differentially regulates maturation, trafficking, and activity of alpha-beta heterodimers. It is not known whether the distinct role of alpha2 in the heart is related to selective assembly with a particular one of the three beta isoforms. We show here by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation that alpha2 is preferentially expressed with beta2 in T-tubules of cardiac myocytes, forming alpha2beta2 heterodimers. We have expressed human alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1, alpha2beta2, and alpha2beta3 in Pichia pastoris, purified the complexes, and compared their functional properties. alpha2beta2 and alpha2beta3 differ significantly from both alpha2beta1 and alpha1beta1 in having a higher K0.5K+ and lower K0.5Na+ for activating Na,K-ATPase. These features are the result of a large reduction in binding affinity for extracellular K+ and shift of the E1P-E2P conformational equilibrium toward E1P. A screen of perhydro-1,4-oxazepine derivatives of digoxin identified several derivatives (e.g. cyclobutyl) with strongly increased selectivity for inhibition of alpha2beta2 and alpha2beta3 over alpha1beta1 (range 22-33-fold). Molecular modeling suggests a possible basis for isoform selectivity. The preferential assembly, specific T-tubular localization, and low K+ affinity of alpha2beta2 could allow an acute response to raised ambient K+ concentrations in physiological conditions and explain the importance of alpha2beta2 for cardiac muscle contractility. The high sensitivity of alpha2beta2 to digoxin derivatives explains beneficial effects of cardiac glycosides for treatment of heart failure and potential of alpha2beta2-selective digoxin derivatives for reducing cardiotoxicity.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient heterologous expression of Fusarium solani lipase, FSL2, in Pichia pastoris, functional characterization of the recombinant enzyme and molecular modeling.</h4><p>R.

Based on sequence similarity with other fungal lipases, FSL2 contains a catalytic triad, consisting of Ser144, Asp198, and His256. FSL2 cDNA was subcloned into the pGAPZalphaA vector containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor signal sequence and this construct was used to transform Pichia pastoris and achieve a high-level extracellular production of a FSL2 lipase. Maximum lipase activity was observed after 48h. The optimum activity of the purified recombinant enzyme was measured at pH 8.0-9.0 and 37 degrees C. FSL2 is remarkably stable at alkaline pH values up to 12 and at temperatures below 40 degrees C. It has high catalytic efficiency towards triglycerides with short to long chain fatty acids but with a marked preference for medium and long chain fatty acids. FSL2 activity is decreased at sodium taurodeoxycholate concentrations above the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of this anionic detergent. However, lipase activity is enhanced by Ca2+ and inhibited by EDTA or Cu2+ and partially by Mg2+ or K+. In silico docking of medium chain triglycerides, monogalctolipids (MGDG), digalactolipids (DGDG) and long chain phospholipids in the active site of FSL2 reveals structural solutions.</p></details><hr><h4>A Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase with Broad Xyloglucan Specificity from the Brown-Rot Fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum and Its Action on Cellulose-Xyloglucan Complexes.</h4><p>Y. Kojima et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 82 6557 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590806>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fungi secrete a set of glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) to degrade plant polysaccharides. Brown-rot fungi, such as Gloeophyllum trabeum, tend to have few LPMOs, and information on these enzymes is scarce. The genome of G. trabeum encodes four auxiliary activity 9 (AA9) LPMOs (GtLPMO9s), whose coding sequences were amplified from cDNA. Due to alternative splicing, two variants of GtLPMO9A seem to be produced, a single-domain variant, GtLPMO9A-1, and a longer variant, GtLPMO9A-2, which contains a C-terminal domain comprising approximately 55 residues without a predicted function. We have overexpressed the phylogenetically distinct GtLPMO9A-2 in Pichia pastoris and investigated its properties. Standard analyses using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and mass spectrometry (MS) showed that GtLPMO9A-2 is active on cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xyloglucan. Importantly, compared to other known xyloglucan-active LPMOs, GtLPMO9A-2 has broad specificity, cleaving at any position along the beta-glucan backbone of xyloglucan, regardless of substitutions. Using dynamic viscosity measurements to compare the hemicellulolytic action of GtLPMO9A-2 to that of a well-characterized hemicellulolytic LPMO, NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa revealed that GtLPMO9A-2 is more efficient in depolymerizing xyloglucan. These measurements also revealed minor activity on glucomannan that could not be detected by the analysis of soluble products by HPAEC-PAD and MS and that was lower than the activity of NcLPMO9C. Experiments with copolymeric substrates showed an inhibitory effect of hemicellulose coating on cellulolytic LPMO activity and did not reveal additional activities of GtLPMO9A-2. These results provide insight into the LPMO potential of G. trabeum and provide a novel sensitive method, a measurement of dynamic viscosity, for monitoring LPMO activity.</p><p><strong> IMPORTANCE:</strong> Currently, there are only a few methods available to analyze end products of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) activity, the most common ones being liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Here, we present an alternative and sensitive method based on measurement of dynamic viscosity for real-time continuous monitoring of LPMO activity in the presence of water-soluble hemicelluloses, such as xyloglucan. We have used both these novel and existing analytical methods to characterize a xyloglucan-active LPMO from a brown-rot fungus. This enzyme, GtLPMO9A-2, differs from previously characterized LPMOs in having broad substrate specificity, enabling almost random cleavage of the xyloglucan backbone. GtLPMO9A-2 acts preferentially on free xyloglucan, suggesting a preference for xyloglucan chains that tether cellulose fibers together. The xyloglucan-degrading potential of GtLPMO9A-2 suggests a role in decreasing wood strength at the initial stage of brown rot through degradation of the primary cell wall.</p></details><hr><h4>Nanofibrillar hydrogel scaffolds from recombinant protein-based polymers with integrin- and proteoglycan-binding domains.</h4><p>M.

With a view to bone tissue engineering applications, we equipped these variants with N-terminal extensions containing either (1) integrin-binding (RGD) or (2) less commonly studied proteoglycan-binding (KRSR) cell-adhesive motifs. The polymers were efficiently produced as secreted proteins using the yeast Pichia pastoris and were essentially monodisperse. The pH-responsive protein-based polymers are soluble at low pH and self-assemble into supramolecular fibrils and hydrogels at physiological pH. By mixing functionalized and nonfunctionalized proteins in different ratios, and adjusting pH, hydrogel scaffolds with the same protein concentration but varying content of the two types of cell-adhesive motifs were readily obtained. The scaffolds were used for the two-dimensional culture of MG-63 osteoblastic cells. RGD domains had a slightly stronger effect than KRSR domains on adhesion, activity, and spreading. However, scaffolds featuring both functional domains revealed a clear synergistic effect on cell metabolic activity and spreading, and provided the highest final degree of cell confluency. The mixed functionalized hydrogels presented here thus allowed to tailor the osteoblastic cell response, offering prospects for their further development as scaffolds for bone regeneration.

Landes et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 113 2633 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27345605>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is widely used for production of recombinant proteins. Here we characterize a vitamin-sensitive regulatory sequence, which can be controlled independently of the main culture medium compounds such as carbon, nitrogen, or phosphor source. The THI11 promoter (PTHI11 ) sequence derives from a gene involved in biosynthesis of thiamine. For characterization, a P. pastoris strain expressing recombinant human serum albumin under control of PTHI11 was grown in the controlled environment of a bioreactor. The thiamine sensitivity of PTHI11 was proven and specified in batch cultures containing different amounts of extracellular thiamine. Under non-repressing conditions PTHI11 offers a constitutive expression pattern with growth rate dependent product formation. Furthermore, promoter activity and thus product formation can be repressed for a desired period of time by supplementing the culture with a pre-defined amount of exogenous thiamine. Once a threshold of biomass is reached, PTHI11 driven expression starts autonomously without external intervention. Based on these findings a tailor-made process strategy was developed and experimentally verified. Additionally, we compared the THI11 promoter with the commonly used GAP promoter. In conclusion, the THI11 promoter is a versatile and easy to control regulatory sequence which enables the realization of novel protein production strategies. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 2633-2643.

The conventional starch liquefaction and saccharification processes are energy-intensive, complicated, and not environmentally friendly. Raw starch-digesting glucoamylases are capable of directly hydrolyzing raw starch to glucose at low temperatures, which significantly simplifies processing and reduces the cost of producing starch-based products.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A novel raw starch-digesting glucoamylase PoGA15A with high enzymatic activity was purified from Penicillium oxalicum GXU20 and biochemically characterized. The PoGA15A enzyme had a molecular weight of 75.4 kDa, and was most active at pH 4.5 and 65 degrees C. The enzyme showed remarkably broad pH stability (pH 2.0-10.5) and substrate specificity, and was able to degrade various types of raw starches at 40 degrees C. Its adsorption ability for different raw starches was consistent with its degrading capacities for the corresponding substrate. The cDNA encoding the enzyme was cloned and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme could quickly and efficiently hydrolyze different concentrations of raw corn and cassava flours (50, 100, and 150 g/L) with the addition of alpha-amylase at 40 degrees C. Furthermore, when used in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of 150 g/L raw flours to ethanol with the addition of alpha-amylase, the ethanol yield reached 61.0 g/L with a high fermentation efficiency of 95.1 % after 48 h when raw corn flour was used as the substrate. An ethanol yield of 57.0 g/L and 93.5 % of fermentation efficiency were achieved with raw cassava flour after 36 h. In addition, the starch-binding domain deletion analysis revealed that SBD plays a very important role in raw starch hydrolysis by the enzyme PoGA15A.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A novel raw starch-digesting glucoamylase from P. oxalicum, with high enzymatic activity, was biochemically, molecularly, and genetically identified. Its efficient hydrolysis of raw starches and its high efficiency during the direct conversion of raw corn and cassava flours via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation to ethanol suggests that the enzyme has a number of potential applications in industrial starch processing and starch-based ethanol production.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous production of an acidic thermostable lipase with broad-range pH activity from thermophilic fungus Neosartorya fischeri P1.</h4><p>Q.

All genes were found to be functional after heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. One of them, LIP09, showed high-level expression in Pichia pastoris with the yield of 2.0 g/L in a 3.7-L fermentor. Deduced amino acid sequence of LIP09 consists of a putative signal peptide (residues 1-19) and a mature polypeptide (residues 20-562). Compared with other fungal counterparts, purified recombinant LIP09 has some superior properties. It exhibited maximum activity at 60 degrees C and pH 5.0, had broad pH adaptability (>60% activity at pH 3.5-8.0) and stability (retaining >90% activity after incubation at pH 3.0-7.0 for 1 h at 40 degrees C), and was highly thermostable (retaining >96% activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for 30 min). The r-LIP09 had a preference for the medium-chain length p-nitrophenyl esters (C12) rather than short and long-chain length substrates. The high-level expression and excellent properties make LIP09 a potential enzyme candidate in food and feed industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering a family 27 carbohydrate-binding module into an Aspergillus usamii beta-mannanase to perfect its enzymatic properties.</h4><p>J.

To improve the enzymatic properties of a glycoside hydrolase family 5 beta-mannanase from Aspergillus usamii (AuMan5A), two fusion beta-mannanases, AuMan5A-F-M and AuMan5A-R-M, were designed by fusing a TmCBM27 into its C-terminus linked with a flexible peptide F (GGGGS)3 and rigid peptide R (EAAAK)3. Two fusion enzyme genes, Auman5A-F-m and Auman5A-R-m, were constructed as designed theoretically by overlapping PCR. Then, Auman5A and two fusion genes were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Three recombinant beta-mannanases, reAuMan5A, reAuMan5A-F-M and reAuMan5A-R-M, were purified to homogeneity with specific activities of 230.6, 153.3 and 241.7 U/mg. The temperature optimum of reAuMan5A-R-M was 70 degrees C, identical with that of reAuMan5A, while its thermostability and melting temperature (Tm) reached 68 degrees C and 74.9 degrees C, being 8.0 degrees C and 8.4 degrees C higher than those of the latter, respectively. Additionally, the Km values of reAuMan5A-R-M, towards locust bean gum, konjac gum and guar gum, significantly decreased to 0.9, 1.9 and 2.5 mg/mL from 1.7, 3.8 and 4.2 mg/mL of reAuMan5A, while its kcat/Km (catalytic efficiency) values increased to 287.8, 163.7 and 84.4 mL/mgs from 171.2, 97.6 and 56.0 mL/mgs of the latter, respectively. These results verified that the fusion of a TmCBM27 into the C-terminus of AuMan5A mediated by (EAAAK)3 linker contributed to its improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression and biochemical characterization of a novel cold-active lipase from Rhizomucor endophyticus.</h4><p>X.

Only 3 U/ml was obtained with the wild type sequence while the sequence optimized using both ICU and CC objectives showed intermediate performance of 10 U/ml.

The kinases involved in P AOX1 activation or repression by different carbon sources may be promising targets.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We identified two kinase mutants: Deltagut1 and Deltadak, both of which showed strong alcohol oxidase activity under non-methanol carbon sources. Based on these two kinases, we constructed two methanol-free expression systems: Deltagut1-HpGCY1-glycerol (P AOX1 induced by glycerol) and Deltadak-DHA (P AOX1 induced by DHA). By comparing their GFP expression efficiencies, the latter one showed better potential. To further test the Deltadak-DHA system, three more recombinant proteins were expressed as examples. We found that the expression ability of our novel methanol-free Deltadak-DHA system was generally better than the constitutive GAP promoter, and reached 50-60 % of the traditional methanol induced system.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We successfully constructed a novel methanol-free expression system Deltadak-DHA.

Hepcidins cloned from different kinds of fishes have been produced using exogenous expression systems, and their in vitro antimicrobial effects have been verified. However their in vivo effects on gut microbiota and gut health of hosts remain unclear. Here we performed a safety study of hepcidin so that it can be used to reduce microbial contaminations in the food and feed. In this study, Pichia pastoris-expressed Pseudosciaena crocea hepcidin (PC-hepc) was first assessed by simulated digestion tests and then administered to male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in different concentrations. Subchronic toxicity testing, high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota, and examinations on gut metabolism and permeability were conducted. The results showed PC-hepc could be digested in simulated intestinal fluid but not in simulated gastric fluid. PC-hepc had no adverse effects on general health, except causing increase of blood glucose (still in the normal value range of this index) in all trial groups of female rats and intestinal inflammation in HD group of female rats. Community composition of gut microbiota of female MD and HD groups shifted compared with control group, of which the decrease of genus Akkermansia might be related to the increase of blood glucose and intestinal inflammation. Significant increase of fecal nitroreductase activity was also observed in female MD and HD groups. Our results suggest the uses of exogenous PC-hepc in normal dosage are safe, however excess dosage of it may cause intestinal disorder of animals.</p></details><hr><h4>Cross-Linking and Bundling of Self-Assembled Protein-Based Polymer Fibrils via Heterodimeric Coiled Coils.</h4><p>N.

We here demonstrate that the structure of these hydrogels can be tuned via heterodimeric coiled coils that cross-link and bundle the self-assembled protein polymer fibrils. We fused well-characterized, 47 amino acids-long heterodimeric coiled coil "linkers" (DA or DB) to the C-terminus of the triblock polymer. The resulting C2-SH48-C2-DA and C2-SH48-C2-DB polymers, were successfully produced as secreted proteins in Pichia pastoris, with titers of purified protein in the order of g L-1 of clarified broth. Atomic force microscopy showed that fibrils formed by either C2-SH48-C2-DA or C2-SH48-C2-DB alone already displayed extensive bundling, apparently as a result of homotypic (DA/DA and DB/DB) interactions. For fibrils prepared from protein polymers having no linkers, plus a small fraction of polymers containing either DA or DB linkers, no cross-linking and bundling was observed. At these same low concentrations of linkers, fibrils containing both the DA and the DB linkers did show cross-linking and bundling as a consequence of heterodimer formation. This work shows that we can control the extent of bundling and cross-linking of supramolecular fibrils by varying the density of heterodimerizing coiled coils in the fibrils, which is promising for the further development of materials that mimic the extracellular matrix.</p></details><hr><h4>Modular Integrated Secretory System Engineering in Pichia pastoris To Enhance G-Protein Coupled Receptor Expression.</h4><p>K.

Protein degradation, folding problems, and undesired post-translational modifications often occur, together resulting in low expression levels of heterogeneous protein products that are unsuitable for structural studies. We here demonstrate how the integration of multiple engineering modules in Pichia pastoris can be used to increase both the quality and the quantity of overexpressed integral membrane proteins, with the human CXCR4 G-protein coupled receptor as an example. The combination of reduced proteolysis, enhanced ER folding capacity, GlycoDelete-based N-Glycan trimming, and nanobody-based fold stabilization improved the expression of this GPCR in P. pastoris from a low expression level of a heterogeneously glycosylated, proteolyzed product to substantial quantities (2-3 mg/L shake flask culture) of a nonproteolyzed, homogeneously glycosylated proteoform. We expect that this set of tools will contribute to successful expression of more membrane proteins in a quantity and quality suitable for functional and structural studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Correction: Improving the Secretory Expression of an alpha-Galactosidase from Aspergillus niger in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>, PLoS One 11 e0165186 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27764204>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>[This corrects the article</p><p><strong> DOI:</strong> 10.1371/journal.pone.0161529.].</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel enzyme-Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase (SBLE)-responsible for sophorolipid lactonization.</h4><p>K.

A knockout strain for this enzyme does no longer produce lactonic sophorolipids, prompting us to believe that this protein is the missing S. bombicola lactone esterase (SBLE). SBLE catalyzes a rather unusual reaction, i.e., an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of acidic sophorolipids in an aqueous environment, which raised questions about its activity and mode of action. Here, we report the heterologous production of this enzyme in Pichia pastoris and its purification in a two-step strategy. Purified recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) was used to perform HPLC and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based assays with different sophorolipid mixtures. We experimentally confirmed that SBLE is able to perform ring closure of acetylated acidic sophorolipids. This substrate was selected for rSBLE kinetic studies to estimate the apparent values of K m . We established that rSBLE displays optimal activity in the pH range of 3.5 to 6 and has an optimal temperature in the range of 20 to 50 degrees C. Additionally, we generated a rSBLE mutant through site-directed mutagenesis of Ser194 in the predicted active site pocket and show that this mutant is lacking the ability to lactonize sophorolipids. We therefore propose that SBLE operates via the common serine hydrolase mechanism in which the catalytic serine residue is assisted by a His/Asp pair.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving thermal hysteresis activity of antifreeze protein from recombinant Pichia pastoris by removal of N-glycosylation.</h4><p>E.

In this study, we demonstrate that FfIBP produced by P. pastoris has a glycosylation site, which diminishes the thermal hysteresis activity of FfIBP. The FfIBP expressed by P. pastoris exhibited a doublet on SDS-PAGE. The results of a glycosidase reaction suggested that FfIBP possesses complex N-linked oligosaccharides. These results indicate that the residues of the glycosylated site could disturb the binding of FfIBP to ice molecules. The findings of this study could be utilized to produce highly active antifreeze proteins on a large scale.</p></details><hr><h4>Purification and characterization of a novel phloretin-2'-O-glycosyltransferase favoring phloridzin biosynthesis.</h4><p>T.

In this work, a novel P2'GT of Malus x domestica (MdP2'GT) with a specific activity of 46.82 mukat/Kg protein toward phloretin and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) at an optimal temperature of 30 degrees C and pH 8.0 was purified from the engineered Pichia pastoris broth to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography, His-Trap affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purified MdP2'GT was low N-glycosylated and secreted as a stable dimer with a molecular mass of 70.7 kDa in its native form. Importantly, MdP2'GT also exhibited activity towards quercetin and adenosine diphosphate glucose (ADPG), kaempferol and UDPG, quercetin and UDP-galactose, isoliquiritigenin and UDPG, and luteolin and UDPG, producing only one isoquercitrin, astragalin, hyperoside, isoliquiritin, or cynaroside, respectively. This broad spectrum of activities make MdP2'GT a promising biocatalyst for the industrial preparation of the corresponding polyphenol glycosides, preferably for their subsequent isolation and purification. Besides, MdP2'GT displayed the lowest Km and the highest kcat/Km for phloretin and UDPG compared to all previously reported P2'GTs, making MdP2'GT favor phloridzin synthesis the most.</p></details><hr><h4>Enzymatic fine-tuning for 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl) beta-D-xylopyranoside synthesis catalyzed by the recombinant beta-xylosidase BxTW1 from Talaromyces amestolkiae.</h4><p>M.

Traditionally, these molecules have been chemically obtained, but its efficient production is limited by the lack of regio- and stereo-selectivity of the chemical synthesis. As an interesting alternative, glycosidases are able to catalyze the formation of glycosides in a process considered green and highly selective. In this study, we report the expression and characterization of a fungal beta-xylosidase in Pichia pastoris. The transglycosylation potential of the enzyme was evaluated and its applicability in the synthesis of a selective anti-proliferative compound demonstrated.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The beta-xylosidase BxTW1 from the ascomycete fungus Talaromyces amestolkiae was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The yeast secreted 8 U/mL of beta-xylosidase that was purified by a single step of cation-exchange chromatography. rBxTW1 in its active form is an N-glycosylated dimer of about 200 kDa. The enzyme was biochemically characterized displaying a K m and k cat against p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside of 0.20 mM and 69.3 s-1 respectively, and its maximal activity was achieved at pH 3 and 60 degrees C. The glycan component of rBxTW1 was also analyzed in order to interpret the observed loss of stability and maximum velocity when compared with the native enzyme. A rapid screening of aglycone specificity was performed, revealing a remarkable high number of potential transxylosylation acceptors for rBxTW1. Based on this analysis, the enzyme was successfully tested in the synthesis of 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl) beta-D-xylopyranoside, a well-known selective anti-proliferative compound, enzymatically obtained for the first time. The application of response surface methodology, following a Box-Behnken design, enhanced this production by eightfold, fitting the reaction conditions into a multiparametric model. The naphthyl derivative was purified and its identity confirmed by NMR.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A beta-xylosidase from T. amestolkiae was produced in P. pastoris and purified. The final yields were much higher than those attained for the native protein, although some loss of stability and maximum velocity was observed. rBxTW1 displayed remarkable acceptor versatility in transxylosylation, catalyzing the synthesis of a selective antiproliferative compound, 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl) beta-D-xylopyranoside. These results evidence the interest of rBxTW1 for transxylosylation of relevant products with biotechnological interest.</p></details><hr><h4>Functional inclusion bodies produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>F. Rueda et al., Microb Cell Fact 15 166 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716225>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) are non-toxic protein aggregates commonly produced in recombinant bacteria. They are formed by a mixture of highly stable amyloid-like fibrils and releasable protein species with a significant extent of secondary structure, and are often functional. As nano structured materials, they are gaining biomedical interest because of the combination of submicron size, mechanical stability and biological activity, together with their ability to interact with mammalian cell membranes for subsequent cell penetration in absence of toxicity. Since essentially any protein species can be obtained as IBs, these entities, as well as related protein clusters (e.g., aggresomes), are being explored in biocatalysis and in biomedicine as mechanically stable sources of functional protein. One of the major bottlenecks for uses of IBs in biological interfaces is their potential contamination with endotoxins from producing bacteria.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> To overcome this hurdle, we have explored here the controlled production of functional IBs in the yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella spp.), an endotoxin-free host system for recombinant protein production, and determined the main physicochemical and biological traits of these materials. Quantitative and qualitative approaches clearly indicate the formation of IBs inside yeast, similar in morphology, size and biological activity to those produced in E. coli, that once purified, interact with mammalian cell membranes and penetrate cultured mammalian cells in absence of toxicity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Structurally and functionally similar from those produced in E. coli, the controlled production of IBs in P. pastoris demonstrates that yeasts can be used as convenient platforms for the biological fabrication of self-organizing protein materials in absence of potential endotoxin contamination and with additional advantages regarding, among others, post-translational modifications often required for protein functionality.</p></details><hr><h4>Genome mining and motif truncation of glycoside hydrolase family 5 endo-beta-1,4-mannanase encoded by Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 for potential konjac flour hydrolysis or feed additive.</h4><p>C.

The AoMan5A contains a predicted family 1 carbohydrate binding module (CBM-1), located at its N-terminal. The AoMan5A, AoMan5B and truncated mutant AoMan5ADeltaCL (truncating the N-terminal CBM and linker of AoMan5A) were expressed retaining the N-terminus of the native protein in Pichia pastoris GS115 by pPIC9KM. The specific enzyme activity of the purified reAoMan5A, reAoMan5B and reAoMan5ADeltaCL towards locust bean gum at pH 3.6 and 40 degrees C for 10min, was 8.3, 104.2 and 15.8U/mg, respectively. The temperature properties of the reAoMan5ADeltaCL were improved by truncating CBM. They can degrade the pretreated konjac flour and produce prebiotics. In addition, they had excellent stability under simulative gastric fluid and simulative prilling process. All these properties make these recombinant beta-mannanases potential additives for use in the food and feed industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression and biological characterization of the antimicrobial peptide fowlicidin-2 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L.

Fowlicidin-2, which is composed of 31 amino acids, is widely expressed in the majority of tissues in chickens and has an important role in innate immunity. In the present study, a recombinant expression system for fowlicidin-2 was successfully constructed using Pichia pastoris X-33 and the expression vector pPICZalpha-A. Under the optimized fermentation conditions, 85.6 mg fowlicidin-2 with >95% purity was obtained from 1 liter culture medium following purification by ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The recombinant fowlicidin-2 exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and had a minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 1 to 4 microM. Furthermore, recombinant fowlicidin-2 exhibited hemolytic activity, promoting 50% human erythrocyte hemolysis in the concentration range of 128-256 microM, and anticancer activity, resulting in the death of 50% of A375 human malignant melanoma cells in the concentration range of 2-4 microM. The results of the present study suggest that recombinant fowlicidin-2 may be a promising candidate for therapeutic applications.</p></details><hr><h4>AoAtg26, a putative sterol glucosyltransferase, is required for autophagic degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>T.

In filamentous fungi, autophagic degradation of organelles such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei occurs in basal cells after the prolonged culture, but its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we functionally analyzed the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae AoAtg26, an ortholog of the sterol glucosyltransferase PpAtg26 involved in pexophagy in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Deletion of Aoatg26 caused a severe decrease in conidiation and aerial hyphae formation, which is typically observed in the autophagy-deficient A. oryzae strains. In addition, cup-shaped AoAtg8-positive membrane structures were accumulated in the Aoatg26 deletion strain, indicating that autophagic process is impaired. Indeed, the Aoatg26 deletion strain was defective in the degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei. Taken together, AoAtg26 plays an important role for autophagic degradation of organelles in A. oryzae, which may physiologically contribute to the differentiation in filamentous fungi.</p></details><hr><h4>Production, Quality Control, Stability and Pharmacotoxicity of a Malaria Vaccine Comprising Three Highly Similar PfAMA1 Protein Molecules to Overcome Antigenic Variation.</h4><p>B.

In preparation for clinical trials, three Diversity Covering (DiCo) PfAMA1 ectodomain proteins, designed to overcome the intrinsic polymorphism that is present in PfAMA1, were produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in Pichia pastoris. Using identical methodology, the 3 strains were cultivated in 70-L scale fed-batch fermentations and PfAMA1-DiCos were purified by two chromatography steps, an ultrafiltration/diafiltration procedure and size exclusion chromatography, resulting in highly pure (>95%) PfAMA1-DiCo1, PfAMA1 DiCo2 and PfAMA1 DiCo3, with final yields of 1.8, 1.9 and 1.3 gram, respectively. N-terminal determinations showed that approximately 50% of each of the proteins lost 12 residues from their N-terminus, in accordance with SDS-PAGE (2 main bands) and MS-data. Under reducing conditions a site of limited proteolytic cleavage within a disulphide bonded region became evident. The three proteins quantitatively bound to the mAb 4G2 that recognizes a conformational epitope, suggesting proper folding of the proteins. The lyophilized Drug Product (1:1:1 mixture of PfAMA1-DiCo1, DiCo2, DiCo3) fulfilled all pre-set release criteria (appearance, dissolution rate, identity, purity, protein content, moisture content, sub-visible particles, immuno-potency (after reconstitution with adjuvant), abnormal toxicity, sterility and endotoxin), was stable in accelerated and real-time stability studies at -20 degrees C for over 24 months. When formulated with adjuvants selected for clinical phase I evaluation, the Drug Product did not show adverse effect in a repeated-dose toxicity study in rabbits. The Drug Product has entered a phase Ia/Ib clinical trial.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of l-glutamate oxidase in Pichia pastoris using multi-copy expression strains and high cell density cultivation.</h4><p>W.

In the present study, Pichia pastoris was used for heterologous production of GLOD following optimization of the gox coding sequence for expression in the yeast host. A series of constructs based on the pHBM905BDM plasmid were engineered and transformed into P. pastoris to increase the gox copy number. The results indicated that GLOD protein levels and enzyme activity increased with increasing gox copy number. Strain PGLOD4, which contained four copies of the target gene, was chosen for subsequent fermentation experiments, and a fermentation strategy involving two exponential feeding phases was developed. During the preinduction phase, glycerol was fed exponentially at muG = 0.15/h. When the cell density reached 300 g/l, methanol was fed exponentially at muM = 0.03/h to induce GLOD production. After 84 h of cultivation, the final cell density and total enzyme activity reached 420 g/L and 247.8 U/mL, respectively. The recombinant enzyme displayed an optimum temperature of 40 degrees C, which was higher than recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli. This is important because increasing the temperature could accelerate enzymatic transformation of l-glutamic acid to alpha-KG. Experiments also demonstrated superior thermo-stability for the enzyme produced in yeast, which further enhances its potential for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Erratum to: Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

This study identified novel methyltransferases (MTs) involved in detoxification and degradation of ATR residues in rice plants. From a subset of MTs differentially expressed in ATR-exposed rice, forty-four O-methyltransferase genes were investigated. Total activities were significantly enhanced by ATR in rice tissues. To prove detoxifying capacity of the MTs in rice plants, two rice O-MTs (LOC_Os04g09604 and LOC_Os11g15040) were selected and transformed into yeast cells (Pichia pastoris X-33). The positive transformants accumulated less ATR and showed less toxicity. Using UPLC-TOF-MS/MS, ATR-degraded products in rice and yeast cells were characterized. A novel O-methylated-modified metabolite (atraton) and six other ATR-derivatives were detected. The topological interaction between LOC_Os04g09604 enzyme and its substrate was specially analyzed by homology modeling programs, which was well confirmed by the molecular docking analysis. The significance of the study is to provide a better understanding of mechanisms for the specific detoxification and degradation of ATR residues in rice growing in environmentally relevant ATR-contaminated soils and may hold a potential engineering perspective for generating ATR-resistant rice that helps to minimize ATR residues in crops.</p></details><hr><h4>Development of simple random mutagenesis protocol for the protein expression system in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Error-prone PCR is often employed for random mutagenesis in bacterial protein expression systems, but has rarely been used in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris system, despite its significant advantages, mainly because large (mug-level) amounts of plasmids are required for transformation.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We developed a quick and easy technique for random mutagenesis in P. pastoris by sequential Phi29 DNA polymerase-based amplification methods, error-prone rolling circle amplification (RCA) and multiple displacement amplification (MDA). The methodology was validated by applying it for random mutation of the gene encoding cellulase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PcCel6A), a key enzyme in degradation of cellulosic biomass. In the error-prone RCA step, the concentrations of manganese ion (Mn(2+)) and cellulase gene-containing plasmid were varied, and the products obtained under each condition were subjected to the second MDA step in the absence of Mn(2+). The maximum error rate was 2.6 mutations/kb, as evaluated from the results of large-scale sequencing. Several mug of MDA products was transformed by electroporation into Pichia cells, and the activities of extracellularly expressed PcCel6A mutants towards crystalline and amorphous celluloses were compared with those of wild-type enzyme to identify key amino acid residues affecting degradation of crystalline cellulose.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We present a rapid and convenient random mutagenesis method that does not require laborious steps such as ligation, cloning, and synthesis of specific primers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we developed a Pichia pastoris yeast system for secretory expression of the virus-like particles (VLPs) for CA16 by co-expression of the P1 and 3CD proteins of CA16. SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to identify the formation of VLPs. Immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of the CA16 VLPs were assessed in BABL/c mouse models. RESULTS Biochemical and biophysical analysis showed that the yeast-expressed CA16 VLPs were composed of VP0, VP1, and VP3 capsid subunit proteins, and present spherical particles with a diameter of 30 nm, similar to the parental infectious CA16 virus. Furthermore, CA16 VLPs elicited potent humoral and cellular immune responses, and VLPs-immunized sera conferred efficient protection to neonatal mice against lethal CA16 challenge.

The Vmh2-GFP fusion protein has proven to be a smart and effective tool for the study of Vmh2 self-assembling. Since the two proteins were linked by the specific cutting site of the thrombin, the fusion protein was used as the active biological element in the realization of a thrombin biosensor. When the thrombin present in the target solution specifically hydrolyzed its cleavage sequence, a consequent decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the sample could be observed. The Vmh2-GFP based assay allowed quantification of thrombin in solution with a detection limit of 2.27aM. The specificity of the assay with respect to other proteases and proteins granted the measurement of thrombin added to healthy human plasma with same high sensitivity and a limit of detection of 2.3aM. Further advantages of the developed biosensor are the simplicity of its design and preparation, and the low requirements in terms of samples, reagents and time.</p></details><hr><h4>Deciphering how LIP2 and POX2 promoters can optimally regulate recombinant protein production in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.</h4><p>H. Sassi et al., Microb Cell Fact 15 159 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651221>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> In recent years, the non-conventional model yeast species Yarrowia lipolytica has received much attention because it is a useful cell factory for producing recombinant proteins. In this species, expression vectors involving LIP2 and POX2 promoters have been developed and used successfully for protein production at yields similar to or even higher than those of other cell factories, such as Pichia pastoris. However, production processes involving these promoters can be difficult to manage, especially if carried out at large scales in fed-batch bioreactors, because they require hydrophobic inducers, such as oleic acid or methyl oleate. Thus, the challenge has become to reduce loads of hydrophobic substrates while simultaneously promoting recombinant protein production. One possible solution is to replace a portion of the inducer with a co-substrate that can serve as an alternative energy source. However, implementing such an approach would require detailed knowledge of how carbon sources impact promoter regulation, which is surprisingly still lacking for the LIP2 and POX2 promoters. This study's aim was thus to better characterize promoter regulation and cell metabolism in Y. lipolytica cultures grown in media supplemented with different carbon sources.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> pPOX2 induction could be detected when glucose or glycerol was used as sole carbon source, which meant these carbon source could not prevent promoter induction. In addition, when a mixture of glucose and oleic acid was used in complex medium, pPOX2 induction level was lower that that of pLIP2. In contrast, pLIP2 induction was absent when glucose was present in the culture medium, which meant that cell growth could occur without any recombinant gene expression. When a 40/60 mixture of glucose and oleic acid (w/w) was used, a tenfold increase in promoter induction, as compared to when an oleic-acid-only medium was observed. It was also clear that individual cells were adapting metabolically to use both glucose and oleic acid. Indeed, no distinct subpopulations that specialized on glucose versus oleic acid were observed; such an outcome would have led to producer and non-producer phenotypes. In medium containing both glucose and oleic acid, cells tended to directly metabolize oleic acid instead of storing it in lipid bodies.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study found that pLIP2 is a promoter of choice as compared to pPOX2 to drive gene expression for recombinant protein production by Y. lipolytica used as cell factory.</p></details><hr><h4>The Y54(L)W mutation of anti-leukotriene C4 single-chain antibody increases affinity to leukotriene E4.</h4><p>Y.

To elucidate the individual contribution of Tyr-54 and Asn-58 in the light chain of mAbLTC, both of which formed a hydrogen bond with glutamic acid of LTC4, we examined whether substitution of the residues affects the antigen binding affinity and specificity using an anti-LTC4 single chain variable fragment (scFvLTC). Among the Tyr-54(L) mutants, Y54(L)W showed a dramatic increase in the affinity to LTE4 which was comparable to that to LTD4 Essentially the same results were obtained using the Y54(L)W mutant expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. The structural modeling suggested the formation of a novel hydrogen bond between the substituted tryptophan in the antibody and the cysteine residue in LTE4 The affinity of Y54(L)R, Y54(L)E and Y54(L)L to LTC4 was markedly reduced, whereas other tested Tyr-54(L) mutants as well as Asn-58(L) mutants did not show significant change in LT binding. The results may provide an insight into the molecular basis of specific LT recognition by the antibody.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of high activity Aspergillus niger BCC4525 beta-mannanase in Pichia pastoris and its application for mannooligosaccharides production from biomass hydrolysis.</h4><p>P.

The secreted enzyme hydrolyzed locust bean gum substrate with very high activity (1625 U/mL) and a relatively high kcat/Km (461 mg-1 s-1 mL). The enzyme is thermophilic and thermostable with an optimal temperature of 70 degrees C and 40% retention of endo-beta-1,4-mannanase activity after preincubation at 70 degrees C. In addition, the enzyme exhibited broad pH stability with an optimal pH of 5.5. The recombinant enzyme hydrolyzes low-cost biomass, including palm kernel meal (PKM) and copra meal, to produce mannooligosaccharides, which is used as prebiotics to promote the growth of beneficial microflora in animals. An in vitro digestibility test simulating the gastrointestinal tract system of broilers suggested that the recombinant beta-mannanase could effectively liberate reducing sugars from PKM-containing diet. These characteristics render this enzyme suitable for utilization as a feed additive to improve animal performance.</p></details><hr><h4>Novel homologous lactate transporter improves L-lactic acid production from glycerol in recombinant strains of Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>P. B. de Lima et al., Microb Cell Fact 15 158 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634467>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Crude glycerol is the main byproduct of the biodiesel industry. Although it can have different applications, its purification is costly. Therefore, in this study a biotechnological route has been proposed for further utilization of crude glycerol in the fermentative production of lactic acid. This acid is largely utilized in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and chemical industries, making it the hydroxycarboxylic acid with the highest market potential worldwide. Currently, industrial production of lactic acid is done mainly using sugar as the substrate. Thus here, for the first time, Pichia pastoris has been engineered for heterologous L-lactic acid production using glycerol as a single carbon source. For that, the Bos taurus lactate dehydrogenase gene was introduced into P. pastoris. Moreover, a heterologous and a novel homologous lactate transporter have been evaluated for L-lactic acid production.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Batch fermentation of the P. pastoris X-33 strain producing LDHb allowed for lactic acid production in this yeast. Although P. pastoris is known for its respiratory metabolism, batch fermentations were performed with different oxygenation levels, indicating that lower oxygen availability increased lactic acid production by 20 %, pushing the yeast towards a fermentative metabolism. Furthermore, a newly putative lactate transporter from P. pastoris named PAS has been identified by search similarity with the lactate transporter from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Jen1p. Both heterologous and homologous transporters, Jen1p and PAS, were evaluated in one strain already containing LDH activity. Fed-batch experiments of P. pastoris strains carrying the lactate transporter were performed with the batch phase at aerobic conditions followed by an aerobic oxygen-limited phase where production of lactic acid was favored. The results showed that the strain containing PAS presented the highest lactic acid titer, reaching a yield of approximately 0.7 g/g.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We showed that P. pastoris has a great potential as a fermentative organism for producing L-lactic acid using glycerol as the carbon source at limited oxygenation conditions (below 0.05 % DO in the bioreactor). The best strain had both the LDHb and the homologous lactate transporter encoding genes expressed, and reached a titer 1.5 times higher than the strain with the S. cerevisiae transporter. Finally, it was also shown that increased lactic acid production was concomitant to reduction of acetic acid formation by half.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimized expression of prolyl aminopeptidase in Pichia pastoris and its characteristics after glycosylation.</h4><p>H.

In the present study, the prolyl aminopeptidase gene (pap) from Aspergillus oryzae JN-412 was optimized through the codon usage of Pichia pastoris. Both the native and optimized pap genes were inserted into the expression vector pPIC9 K and were successfully expressed in P. pastoris. Additionally, the activity of the intracellular enzyme expressed by the recombinant optimized pap gene reached 61.26 U mL(-1), an activity that is 2.1-fold higher than that of the native gene. The recombinant enzyme was purified by one-step elution through Ni-affinity chromatography. The optimal temperature and pH of the purified PAP were 60 degrees C and 7.5, respectively. Additionally, the recombinant PAP was recovered at a yield greater than 65 % at an extremely broad range of pH values from 6 to 10 after treatment at 50 degrees C for 6 h. The molecular weight of the recombinant PAP decreased from 50 kDa to 48 kDa after treatment with a deglycosylation enzyme, indicating that the recombinant PAP was completely glycosylated. The glycosylated PAP exhibited high thermo-stability. Half of the activity remained after incubation at 50 degrees C for 50 h, whereas the remaining activity of PAP expressed in E. coli was only 10 % after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h. PAP could be activated by the appropriate salt concentration and exhibited salt tolerance against NaCl at a concentration up to 5 mol L(-1).</p></details><hr><h4>Functional expression and characterization of a glucuronoyl esterase from the fungus Neurospora crassa: identification of novel consensus sequences containing the catalytic triad.</h4><p>H.

The enzyme glucuronoyl esterase (GE) that constitutes a novel family of carbohydrate esterases, CE15, has been shown to display a unique ability to cleave the ester linkage between lignin alcohols and xylan-bound 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of hemicellulose. We herein report identification, expression, and functional characterization of a new GE, NcGE, from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. C-terminally c-myc and hexahistidine-tagged NcGE was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. NcGE purified from the culture supernatant through Ni-NTA and anion exchange chromatographies showed the ability to hydrolyze the substrate 3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propyl methyl 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosiduronate, which mimics the ester linkage of 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). This esterase showed the characteristic of a mesophilic enzyme with the temperature optimum at 40-50 degrees C, and displayed the optimal activity at pH 7 and broad pH stability. Based on the alignment of NcGE with other GEs so far characterized, we propose novel consensus sequences for GEs containing the catalytic triad.</p></details><hr><h4>Feruloyl esterases from Schizophyllum commune to treat food industry side-streams.</h4><p>A.

Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) from Schizophyllum commune were functionally expressed in Pichia pastoris with extracellular activities of 6000UL(-1). The recombinant enzymes, ScFaeD1 and ScFaeD2, released ferulic acid from destarched wheat bran and sugar beet pectin. Overnight incubation of coffee pulp released caffeic (>60%), ferulic (>80%) and p-coumaric acid (100%) indicating applicability for the valorization of food processing wastes and enhanced biomass degradation. Based on substrate specificity profiling and the release of diferulates from destarched wheat bran, the recombinant FAEs were characterized as type D FAEs. ScFaeD1 and ScFaeD2 preferably hydrolyzed feruloylated saccharides with ferulic acid esterified to the O-5 position of arabinose residues and showed an unprecedented ability to hydrolyze benzoic acid esters.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of recombinant Newcastle disease virus F protein in Pichia pastoris and its immunogenicity using flagellin as the adjuvant.</h4><p>X.

Although both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are used to prevent and control the spread of ND among chickens, the increasing number of ND outbreaks in commercial poultry flocks worldwide indicates that routine vaccinations are insufficient to control ND. Hence, efforts are being invested into developing alternative and more effective vaccination strategies. In this study, we focus on F protein, the neutralizing and protective antigen of NDV, and flagellin (FliC), a toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist that is an effective inducer of innate immune responses. We amplified F gene from velogenic NDV strain F48E8. The recombinant histidine (His)-tagged F protein was efficiently expressed in a Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) eukaryotic system and verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. The conditions for F protein expression in P. pastoris were optimal. The immunogenicity of F protein with FliC as the adjuvant was evaluated in a C3H/HeJ mouse model. FliC was found to enhance both F-specific and NDV-specific IgG responses and F-specific cellular immune responses following intraperitoneal co-administration with F protein. Thus, the recombinant F protein expressed by P. pastoris when used with flagellin as the adjuvant has potential as a subunit vaccine candidate.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and purification of the kinase domain of PINK1 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D. Wu et al., Protein Expr Purif 128 67 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27546451>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically localizes on the mitochondrial membrane. It cooperates with Parkin to regulate mitochondrial quality control. Mutations in PINK1 protein which account for 8-15% of Parkinson's disease (PD), are the second most common cause of early-onset Autosomal Recessive Parkinson's disease (AR-PD). The lack of methods for PINK1 heterologous expression and purification has slowed progress in the AR-PD research field. To pave the way for direct structural study of this important protein, in this study, we developed an efficient expression system of recombinant PINK1 kinase domain (rPINK1) using Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Our results showed that rPINK1 is best expressed in P. pastoris at 25 degrees C induction. Additionally, we determined that the optimal induction time was 72 h and the optimal induction methanol concentration was 1% for the expression of rPINK1 in P. pastoris. Subsequent purification by Ni affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA) and cation-exchange chromatography (Mono S) produced the protein with purity higher than 95%. The pure rPINK1 was active to phosphorylate ubiquitin in a substrate phosphorylation assay. Overall, these studies provide the first effective method for heterologous expression and purification of the rPINK1 with a high purity. These findings can help contribute to further researches on the interactions study and biochemical characterization of PINK1.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of codon optimized Trichoderma reesei Cel6A in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>F.

The work attempted to use codon optimization to enhance Trichoderma reesei Cel6A expression in Pichia pastoris. Two recombinants P. pastoris GS115 containing AOX1 and GAP promotors were successfully constructed, respectively. The optimal temperatures and pHs of the expressed Cel6A from two recombinants were consistent with each other, were also in the extremely similar range to that reported on the native Cel6A from T. reesei. Based on the shake flask fermentation, AOX1 promotor enabled the recombinant to produce 265U/L and 300mg/L of the Cel6A enzyme, and the GAP promotor resulted in 145U/L and 200mg/L. High cell density fed batch (HCDFB) fermentation significantly improved the enzyme titer (1100U/L) and protein yield (2.0g/L) for the recombinant with AOX1 promotor. Results have showed that the AOX1 promotor is more suitable than the GAP for the Cel6A expression in P. pastoris. And the HCDFB cultivation is a favorable way to express the Cel6A highly in the methanol inducible yeast.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression and characterization of a novel serine protease in Pichia pastoris by multi-copy integration.</h4><p>M. Shu et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 92 56 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542745>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A novel serine protease from Trichoderma koningii (SPTK) was synthesized and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant SPTK was completely inhibited by phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), suggesting that SPTK belonged to the subgroup of serine proteases. The optimum pH and temperature for the recombinant SPTK reaction were 6.0 and 55 degrees C, respectively. SPTK performed a tolerance to most organic solvents and metal ions, and the addition of Triton X-100 exhibited an activation of SPTK up to 243% of its initial activity but SDS strongly inhibited. Moreover, our study showed that a portion of SPTK was N-glycosylated during fermentation. The activity and thermal stability of the recombinant SPTK were improved after the removal of glycosylation, and the N-glycosylation of SPTK could be efficiently removed through co-culture with P. pastoris strains expressing Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. We constructed expression vectors harboring from one to four repeats of Sptk-expressing cassettes via an in vitro BioBrick assembly approach. And the result of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) indicated that the tandem expression cassettes were integrated into the genome of P. pastoris through a single recombination event. These strains were used to study the correlation between the gene copy number and the expression level of SPTK. The results of qPCR and enzyme activity assays indicated that the copy number variation of Sptk gene generally had a positive effect on the expression level of SPTK, while an increase in integration of target gene did not guarantee its high expression. The maximum yield and specific activity of SPTK in P. pastoris were obtained from the recombinant yeast strain harboring two-copy tandem Sptk-expressing cassettes, the yield reached 0.48g/l after a 6-d induction using menthol in shake flasks and 3.2g/l in high-density fermentation with specific activity of 5200U/mg. In addition, the recombinant SPTK could efficiently degrade chicken feather and hydrolyzed the gelatin layer of photographic film. These properties made the recombinant SPTK a suitable candidate for industrial applications and for eliminating the pollution of keratin.</p></details><hr><h4>The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) functions in hematopoiesis through JNK activation in Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis.</h4><p>Z.

In the present study, a RACK1 (designed as EsRACK1) gene from Chinese mitten crab E. sinensis was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The full-length cDNA sequence of EsRACK1 was of 1117 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 957 bp encoding a polypeptide of 318 amino acids containing seven WD repeats. EsRACK1 shared 62%-99% similarities with previously identified RACK1s in amino acid sequence, and it was clustered with the RACK1 from Pacifastacus leniusculus in the phylogenetic tree. The mRNA transcripts of EsRACK1 were constitutively expressed in various tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression of EsRACK1 mRNA in hemocytes were significantly up-regulated post the stimulations with Vibrio anguillarum and Pichia pastoris. After exposure to CdCl2 and pentachlorophenol, the transcripts of EsRACK1 in hemocytes were up-regulated at the late phase from 12 h. When EsRACK1 was knocked down by dsRNA based RNAi, the total hemocyte counts, new-born hemocytes and phosphorylation of JNK were all significantly decreased. In addition, EsRACK1 transcription and phosphorylation of JNK were both decreased in hematopoietic tissue post Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. All the results suggested that EsRACK1 was involved in the innate immune response of the crab and participated in the production of new-born hemocytes through activation of JNK.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression, purification and identification of a thermolysin-like protease, neutral protease I, from Aspergillus oryzae with the Pichia pastoris expression system.</h4><p>X.

This study was designed to obtain high expression levels of neutral protease I from Aspergillus oryzae 3.042 by using Pichia pastoris GS115 as the host strain for industrial purposes. The coding sequence of the target gene was modified, synthesized, and then cloned into the expression vector pHBM905BDM, which harbored the d1+2 x 201 AOX1 promoter and the MF4I leader sequence. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant strain was used for high-density fermentation in a 4-L fermenter. The yield of the target protein reached 12.87 mg/mL, and the enzyme activity was approximately 49370 U/mL, which indicated that this enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris at a high level. The target protein was purified and characterized. Its optimum temperature and pH were 55 degrees C and 8.0, respectively. This enzyme was extremely sensitive to EDTA, which is consistent with the previous reports that it is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. Our results indicated that low concentrations of zinc, calcium and magnesium ions stimulated the enzyme activity, whereas high concentrations inhibited its activity. In addition, calcium and magnesium ions increased the thermostability of the enzyme. All of the evidence indicated that this protease is a thermolysin-like peptidase.</p></details><hr><h4>Overexpressing target helper genes enhances secretion and glycosylation of recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris under simulated microgravity.</h4><p>J. Huangfu, Y. Xu, C. Li, J.

Co-expressing of four genes PRX1, YAP1, AHA1, and YPT6, involved in the oxidative stress response and protein folding, exhibited promising helper factor effects on the recombinant protein yields in engineered P. pastoris, respectively. When two of the above genes were co-expressed simultaneously, beta-glucuronidase (PGUS) specific activity was further increased by 30.3-50.6 % comparing with that of single helper gene, particularly when the oxidative stress response and protein folding genes were both present in the combinations. In addition, co-expressing co-chaperone AHA1 and transcription factor YAP1 not only enhanced PGUS secretion, but also affected its glycosylation. Thus, through deep "omics" analysis of SMG effects, our results provided combined impact of new helper factors to improve the efficacy of recombinant protein secretion and glycosylation in engineered P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Extracellular expression and antiviral activity of a bovine interferon-alpha through codon optimization in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Y.

In particular, IFN-alpha is an important antiviral cytokine and has a wide range of immune-modulating functions. Porcine and human IFN-alpha have been successfully prepared and play important roles in the prevention and therapy of viral diseases. To date, there has been limited applied research on bovine IFN-alpha. To achieve high-level expression of recombinant bovine IFN-alpha (bIFN-alpha) in Pichia pastoris for large-scale application, the bIFN-alpha gene was optimized and synthesized on the basis of codon bias of P. pastoris. Optimized bIFN-alpha (opti-bIFN-alpha) was successfully expressed in P. pastoris and directly secreted into the culture supernatant. The amount of extracellular soluble opti-bIFN-alpha was observed to be 200mug/mL in a shake flask. Expression efficiency of opti-bIFN-alpha was found to be about three times that of wild-type bIFN-alpha when the expression yield was compared at the same copies of the targeted gene. In addition, both the original cultural supernatant and purified opti-bIFN-alpha showed strong antiviral activity in MDBK cells (2x10(6)AU/mL and 1x10(7)AU/mg, respectively) and IBRS-2 cells (3x10(5)AU/mL and 1.5x10(6)AU/mg, respectively) against a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the green fluorescence protein. In this study, we demonstrated high-level extracellular expression of opti-bIFN-alpha by P. pastoris. To the best of our knowledge, the opti-bIFN-alpha yield observed in this study is the highest to be reported to date. Our results demonstrated that the extracellular opti-bIFN-alpha with strong antiviral activity could be easily prepared and purified at a low cost and that it may be a potential biological therapeutic drug against bovine viral infections.</p></details><hr><h4>Lipid homeostasis is involved in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum stress in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Zhang et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 478 777 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27524240>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Maintaining cellular lipid composition is essential for many cell processes. Our previous study has demonstrated that Spt23 is an important transcription factor within the cell and responsible for the regulation of fatty acid desaturase genes. Disruption of SPT23 results in increased lipid saturation. In the present study, we found that lipid saturation caused by SPT23 deletion exhibited a growth defect under ethanol stress and increased chitin contents. Ergosterol synthesis-related genes were up-regulated to protect cells from plasma membrane damage in the presence of ethanol. The cell wall stress caused by increased chitin contents could not be attenuated by up-regulation of phospholipids synthesis-related genes in spt23Delta. Besides, lipid saturation induced expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation followed by activation of the cellular antioxidant system, which is associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions. Taken together, our data suggested that lipid homeostasis has a close connection with cell responses to both plasma membrane stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p></details><hr><h4>Methanol Expression Regulator 1 (Mxr1p) Is Essential for the Utilization of Amino Acids as the Sole Source of Carbon by the Methylotrophic Yeast, Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>U. Sahu, P. N. Rangarajan, J Biol Chem 291 20588 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27519409>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris can assimilate amino acids as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. It can grow in media containing yeast extract and peptone (YP), yeast nitrogen base (YNB) + glutamate (YNB + Glu), or YNB + aspartate (YNB + Asp). Methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1p), a zinc finger transcription factor, is essential for growth in these media. Mxr1p regulates the expression of several genes involved in the utilization of amino acids as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. These include the following: (i) GDH2 encoding NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase; (ii) AAT1 and AAT2 encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferases, respectively; (iii) MDH1 and MDH2 encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic malate dehydrogenases, respectively; and (iv) GLN1 encoding glutamine synthetase. Synthesis of all these enzymes is regulated by Mxr1p at the level of transcription except GDH2, whose synthesis is regulated at the level of translation. Mxr1p activates the transcription of AAT1, AAT2, and GLN1 in cells cultured in YP as well as in YNB + Glu media, whereas transcription of MDH1 and MDH2 is activated in cells cultured in YNB + Glu but not in YP. A truncated Mxr1p composed of 400 N-terminal amino acids activates transcription of target genes in cells cultured in YP but not in YNB + Glu. Mxr1p binds to Mxr1p response elements present in the promoters of AAT2, MDH2, and GLN1 We conclude that Mxr1p is essential for utilization of amino acids as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, and it is a global regulator of multiple metabolic pathways in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioprocess development for extracellular production of recombinant human interleukin-3 (hIL-3) in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>V.

The codon-optimized hIL-3 gene was cloned in fusion with the N-terminus alpha-mating factor signal peptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under an inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) and constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter. A Zeocin concentration up to 2000 mg/L was used to select hyper-producers. The shake flask cultivation studies in the Pichia pastoris GS115 host resulted a maximum recombinant hIL-3 expression level of 145 mg/L in the extracellular medium under the control of AOX1 promoter. The batch fermentation strategy allowed us to attain a fairly pure glycosylated hIL-3 protein in the culture supernatant at a final concentration of 475 mg/L with a high volumetric productivity of 4.39 mg/L/h. The volumetric product concentration achieved at bioreactor level was 3.28 folds greater than the shake flask results. The 6x His-tagged protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and confirmed further by western blot analysis using anti-6x His tag antibody. The glycosylation of recombinant hIL-3 protein was confirmed in a PNGase F deglycosylation reaction where it showed a molecular weight band pattern similar to E. coli produced non-glycosylated hIL-3 protein. The structural properties of recombinant hIL-3 protein were confirmed by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy where protein showed 40 % alpha-helix, 12 % beta-sheets with an emission maxima at 343 nm. MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis was used to establish the protein identity. The biological activity of purified protein was confirmed by the human erythroleukemia TF-1 cell proliferation assay.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and characterization of thermostable glucose dehydrogenases from thermophilic filamentous fungi.</h4><p>K.

In order to obtain a novel FAD-GDH gene homolog, we performed degenerate PCR screening of genomic DNAs from 17 species of thermophilic filamentous fungi. Two FAD-GDH gene homologs were identified and cloned from Talaromyces emersonii NBRC 31232 and Thermoascus crustaceus NBRC 9129. We then prepared the recombinant enzymes produced by Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Absorption spectra and enzymatic assays revealed that the resulting enzymes contained oxidized FAD as a cofactor and exhibited glucose dehydrogenase activity. The transition midpoint temperatures (T m) were 66.4 and 62.5 degrees C for glycosylated FAD-GDHs of T. emersonii and T. crustaceus prepared by using P. pastoris as a host, respectively. Therefore, both FAD-GDHs exhibited high thermostability. In conclusion, we propose that these thermostable FAD-GDHs could be ideal enzymes for use as thermotolerant glucose sensors with high accuracy.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant overexpression of camel hepcidin cDNA in Pichia pastoris: purification and characterization of the polyHis-tagged peptide HepcD-His.</h4><p>M.

The aim of this work was the expression, as secreted peptide, purification, and characterization of a new recombinant polyHis-tagged camel hepcidin (HepcD-His) in yeast Pichia pastoris. The use of this eukaryotic expression system, for the production of HepcD-His, having 6 histidine residues at its C terminus, was simpler and more efficient compared with the use of the prokaryotic system Escherichia coli. Indeed, a single purification step was required to isolate the soluble hepcidin with purity estimated more that 94% and a yield of 2.8 against 0.2 mg/L for the E coli system. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry of the purified HepcD-His showed 2 major peaks at m/z 4524.64 and 4634.56 corresponding to camel hepcidin with 39 and 40 amino acids. Evaluation of disulfide bond connectivity with the Ellman method showed an absence of free thiol groups, testifying that the 8 cysteine residues in the peptide are displayed, forming 4 disulfide bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that camel hepcidin structure was significantly modified at high temperature of 90 degrees C and returns to its original structure when incubation temperature drops back to 20 degrees C. Interestingly, this peptide showed also a greater bactericidal activity, at low concentration of 9.5muM, against E coli, than the synthetic analog DH3. Thus, the production, at a large scale, of the recombinant camel hepcidin, HepcD-His, may be helpful for future therapeutic applications including bacterial infection diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a high sweetness and heat-resistant mutant of sweet-tasting protein, monellin, in Pichia pastoris with a constitutive GAPDH promoter and modified N-terminus.</h4><p>C.

A detailed biochemical and structural characterization of hDMGDH was thus far hampered by insufficient heterologous expression of the protein. In the present study, we report the development of an intracellular, heterologous expression system in Komagataella phaffii (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) providing the opportunity to determine kinetic parameters, spectroscopic properties, thermostability, and the redox potential of hDMGDH. Moreover, we have successfully crystallized the wild-type enzyme and determined the structure to 3.1-A resolution. The structure-based analysis of our biochemical data provided new insights into the kinetic properties of the enzyme in particular with respect to oxygen reactivity.

The acquired images were analyzed with two image processing algorithms. In seven cultivations the cell concentration was monitored by the applied algorithms and offline samples were taken to determine optical density (OD) and dry cell mass (DCM). Cell concentrations up to 74g/L dry cell mass could be analyzed via the ISM. Depending on the algorithm and the ISM settings, an accuracy between 0.3 % and 12 % was achieved. The overall results show that for a robust measurement a combination of the two described algorithms is required.</p></details><hr><h4>High-yield fermentation and a novel heat-precipitation purification method for hydrophobin HGFI from Grifola frondosa in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

Here, we reported a high-yield fermentation method for hydrophobin HGFI from Grifola frondosa in Pichia pastoris, attaining production of 300 mg/L by keeping the dissolved oxygen level at 15%-25% by turning the methanol-feeding speed. We also developed a novel HGFI-purification method enabling large-scare purification of HGFI, with >90% recovery. Additionally, we observed that hydrophobin HGFI in fermentation broth precipitated at pH < 7.0 and temperatures >90 degrees C. We also identified the structure and properties of proteins purified by this method through atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water-contact angle measurement, which is similar to protein purification by ultrafiltration without heating treatment that enables our method to maintain native HGFI structure and properties. Furthermore, the purification method presented here can be applied to large-scale purification of other type I hydrophobins.</p></details><hr><h4>Crystal structure and genetic modifications of FI-CMCase from Aspergillus aculeatus F-50.</h4><p>J.

Endo-1,4-beta-d-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4; endoglucanase), which catalyzes the random hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-glycosidic bonds of the cellulose main chain to cleave cellulose into smaller fragments, is the key cellulolytic enzyme. An endoglucanase isolated from Aspergillus aculeatus F-50 (FI-CMCase), which is classified into the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 12, was demonstrated to be effectively expressed in the industrial strain Pichia pastoris. Here, the crystal structure and complex structures of P. pastoris-expressed FI-CMCase were solved to high resolution. The overall structure is analyzed and compared to other GH12 members. In addition, the substrate-surrounding residues were engineered to search for variants with improved enzymatic activity. Among 14 mutants constructed, one with two-fold increase in protein expression was identified, which possesses a potential to be further developed as a commercial enzyme product.</p></details><hr><h4>Endogenous signal peptides in recombinant protein production by Pichia pastoris: From in-silico analysis to fermentation.</h4><p>A.

The expression was conducted under glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (PGAP). The highest secretion efficiency among endogenous SPs was obtained by SP23 followed by SP24, SP34, SP13 and SP26, respectively. The fermentation characteristics of rhGH production by the use of SP23, the most favorable endogenous SP of P.pastoris, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor prepro sequence (alpha-MF) were compared. With respect to the SP23 which is 73 amino acids shorter in length compared to alpha-MF, in high cell density cultures, where carbon and energy source are limited, the substitution of SP23 for alpha-MF seems promising. alpha-MF higher secretion efficiency was verified by major physicochemical properties including hydropathy index, isoelectric point, and aliphatic index. Regarding the examined endogenous SPs, there was no clear correlation between secretion efficiency and major physicochemical properties when each of these properties was considered independently. To find a correlation, factors such as protein N-terminus effect, length of the SP, secondary structure of the SP, and interactions of the selected properties should also be investigated.</p></details><hr><h4>The PARS sequence increase the efficiency of stable Pichia pastoris transformation.</h4><p>C.

Plasmids containing the Pichia autonomously replicating sequence (PARS) transform P. pastoris with higher efficiency than linear DNA equipped with termini designed for homologous recombination. Moreover, PARS containing constructs provide higher protein yields. Unfortunately, these autonomous plasmids are inherently unstable and the preferred method of P. pastoris transformation is therefore stable integration in the genome by homologous recombination. In the present study we report that a novel combination of PARS and linearization of plasmids for P. pastoris transformation serves to significantly increase the transformation efficiency. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the constructs do not re-circularize but integrate stably into the P. pastoris genome.</p></details><hr><h4>A new non-phagocytic TLR6 with broad recognition ligands from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.</h4><p>W.

Recently, the expansion of TLRs has been reported in invertebrate genomes, but the characters and immune functions of these expanded TLRs were still not well known. In the present study, a new member of TLR family with five LRR domains was identified in Crassostrea gigas (designated CgTLR6). It shared homology with TLRs from other organisms with the closest phylogenic relationship with molluscan TLRs. The recombinant protein of CgTLR6 (rCgTLR6) displayed direct bind activity to gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio splendidus, gram-positive bacteria Staphylococci aureus and Micrococcus luteus, and fungi Pichia pastoris, but not to fungi Yarrowia lipolytica. It also exhibited affinity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN), while no affinity to mannan (MAN). The mRNA of CgTLR6 was mainly detected in hemocytes and hepatopancreas, and was significantly induced (p < 0.01) in hemocytes after the oyster was stimulated with LPS, PGN or bacteria V. splendidus. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that CgTLR6 was mainly located at the membrane of hemocytes. The blockage of CgTLR6 by anti-rCgTLR6 antibody did not significantly inhibit the phagocytic rates of hemocytes toward recognized gram-negative bacteria V. anguillarum and V. splendidus, and unrecognized fungi Y. lipolytica. These results collectively implied that CgTLR6 was a novel non-phagocytic receptor of C. gigas to mediate humoral immune response by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the invaders.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural and Immunological Characterization of Recombinant 6-Cysteine Domains of the Plasmodium falciparum Sexual Stage Protein Pfs230.</h4><p>N.

Antibodies elicited against sexual stage proteins in the human bloodstream are taken up with the blood meal of the mosquitoes and inactivate parasite development in the mosquito. In a phase 1 trial, a leading TBV identified as Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel(R) appeared safe and immunogenic, however, the level of Pfs25-specific antibodies were likely too low for an effective vaccine. Pfs230, a 230-kDa sexual stage protein expressed in gametocytes is an alternative vaccine candidate. A unique 6-cysteine-rich domain structure within Pfs230 have thwarted its recombinant expression and characterization for clinical evaluation for nearly a quarter of a century. Here, we report on the identification, biochemical, biophysical, and immunological characterization of recombinant Pfs230 domains. Rabbit antibodies generated against recombinant Pfs230 domains blocked mosquito transmission of a laboratory strain and two field isolates using an ex vivo assay. A planned clinical trial of the Pfs230 vaccine is a significant step toward the potential development of a transmission blocking vaccine to eliminate malaria.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative thermal inactivation analysis of Aspergillus oryzae and Thiellavia terrestris cutinase: Role of glycosylation.</h4><p>A. N. Shirke et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 114 63 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27425027>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cutinase thermostability is important so that the enzymes can function above the glass transition of what are often rigid polymer substrates. A detailed thermal inactivation analysis was performed for two well-characterized cutinases, Aspergillus oryzae Cutinase (AoC) and Thiellavia terrestris Cutinase (TtC). Both AoC and TtC are prone to thermal aggregation upon unfolding at high temperature, which was found to be a major reason for irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Our study demonstrates that glycosylation stabilizes TtC expressed in Pichia pastoris by inhibiting its thermal aggregation. Based on the comparative thermal inactivation analyses of non-glycosylated AoC, glycosylated (TtC-G), and non-glycosylated TtC (TtC-NG), a unified model for thermal inactivation is proposed that accounts for thermal aggregation and may be applicable to other cutinase homologues. Inspired by glycosylated TtC, we successfully employed glycosylation site engineering to inhibit AoC thermal aggregation. Indeed, the inhibition of thermal aggregation by AoC glycosylation was greater than that achieved by conventional use of trehalose under a typical condition. Collectively, this study demonstrates the excellent potential of implementing glycosylation site engineering for thermal aggregation inhibition, which is one of the most common reasons for the irreversible thermal inactivation of cutinases and many proteins.

A synthetic CYM gene was designed in silico by replacing codons rarely used by P. pastoris with equivalent nucleotide combinations that codify for the same amino acid but that are more frequently encountered in the genome of P. pastoris. A total of 332 nucleotides were modified to optimize 289 codons. The synthetic CYM gene was cloned into the expression vector pPICZalphaA and transformed into P. pastoris. The transformed strains were grown in artificial media supplemented with glycerol as a carbon source to increase biomass and then cultured in a similar medium replacing glycerol with methanol as a carbon source to initiate gene induction. Raw extracts of the growth media exhibited milk-clotting activity of 146.11 SU/mL. Produced recombinant chymosin showed coagulant activity from 25 to 50 degrees C, and within a pH range of 5-6.9, having optimum activity at 35-40 degrees C, and pH 5.0. These results show that codon optimization is a viable strategy to improve CYM gene expression levels in P. pastoris for the production of recombinant chymosin.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression, purification and initial characterization of a novel recombinant antimicrobial peptide Mytichitin-A in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

To produce large quantity of Mytichitin-A to further investigate its biological activity, nucleotide sequence encoding a recombinant 6 x His-Mytichitin-A (rMytichitin-A) peptide was synthesized and inserted into the inducible yeast expression vector pPICZalphaA. With the availability of such an expression vector called pPICZalphaA-Mytichitin-A, we transformed Pichia pastoris GS115 cells with a SacI-linearized pPICZalphaA-Mytichitin-A by electroporation. Transgenic strains secreting rMytichitin-A with a molecular weight of approximate 10 KDa as expected were obtained. The optimal culture condition for rMytichitin-A expression was determined to be 1.0% methanol induction, 96 h incubation at 28 degrees C and the amount of rMytichitin-A reached 45.5 mug/ml. The percentage of rMytichitin-A was estimated to be 73.6% of the total protein. After rMytichitin-A was purified using nickel ions affinity chromatography, approximate 9.1 mg pure rMytichitin-A was obtained from 500 ml of cell culture medium with 97.8% purity. More importantly, both the culture supernatant and purified rMytichitin-A inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with a minimum inhibition concentration of as low as 31 and 48 mug/ml, respectively. Differently from the native protein, however, the rMytichitin-A is not active against Gram-negative bacteria. Taken together, this is the first report on the heterologous expression of Mytichitin-A in P. pastoris. Our study showed that P. pastoris is an effective expression system for producing large quantities of biologically active Mytichitin-A for both research and application purposes.</p></details><hr><h4>Graphene oxide induces plasma membrane damage, reactive oxygen species accumulation and fatty acid profiles change in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Before the materials being well applied, we should first focus on their biosafety and toxicity. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of synthesized graphene oxide (GO) against the model industrial organism Pichia pastoris. We found that the synthesized GO showed dose-dependent toxicity to P. pastoris, through cell membrane damage and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In response to these cell stresses, cells had normal unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) levels but increased contents of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with up-regulation of UFA synthesis-related genes on the transcriptional level, which made it overcome the stress under GO attack. Two UFA defective strains (spt23Delta and fad12Delta) were used to demonstrate the results above. Hence, this study suggested a close connection between PUFAs and cell survival against GO.</p></details><hr><h4>Constitutive expression of recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

A DNA fragment containing core domain of human PH20 gene was cloned into a constitutive expression plasmid (pGAPZalphaC) of Pichia pastoris to produce a fusion protein with alpha factor signal in the N-terminus and 6 x His as well as c-Myc tags in the C-terminus. The resulting plasmid pGAPZalphaC-PH20 was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris strain GS115. Functional recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20) was successfully expressed and secreted by the recombinant P. pastoris transformant. Highest hyaluronidase activity of 2 mU/mL could be obtained at 3 day in an YPD culture. After purified by phenylboronic acid resin adsorption, rHuPH20 with a specific activity of 230 mU/mg was obtained. Via periodic acid-Schiff staining and zymogram analysis, the partially purified rHuPH20 was determined to be highly glycosylated to various extents with molecular mass in the range of 100-300 kDa. The enzyme showed a maximal activity at pH 5.0 but no appreciable activity at pH </=3 and pH >/=8. The hyaluronidase activity could be stably maintained at 4 degrees C but lost 40% after incubating at 30 degrees C for 4 h. Both N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione showed a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8 mM against rHuPH20.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of the catalytic performance of a Bispora antennata cellulase by replacing the N-terminal semi-barrel structure.</h4><p>F.

A wild-type cellulase (BaCel5) of glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 5 from Bispora antennata and two hybrid enzymes (BaCel5(127) and BaCel5(167)) with replacement of the N-terminal (betaalpha)3 (127 residues) or (betaalpha)4 (167 residues)-barrel with the corresponding sequences of TeEgl5A from Talaromyces emersonii were produced in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. BaCel5 exhibited optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C but had low catalytic efficiency (25.4+/-0.8mLs(-1)mg(-1)). In contrast, BaCel5(127) and BaCel5(167) showed similar enzymatic properties but improved catalytic performance. When using CMC-Na, barley beta-glucan, lichenan, and cellooligosaccharides as substrates, BaCel5(127) and BaCel5(167) had increased specific activities and catalytic efficiencies by approximately 1.8-6.7-fold and approximately 1.0-4.7-fold, respectively. The catalytic efficiency of BaCel5(167) was even higher than that of parental proteins. The underlying mechanism was analyzed by molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Cenchritis muricatus protease inhibitor II (CmPI-II) in Pichia pastoris system: Purification, isotopic labeling and preliminary characterization.</h4><p>A.

CmPI-II 3D structures are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of its activity. In the present work, we describe an efficient and straightforward recombinant expression strategy, as well as a cost-effective procedure for isotope labeling for NMR structure determination purposes. The vector pCM101 containing the CmPI-II gene, under the control of Pichia pastoris AOX1 promoter was constructed. Methylotrophic Pichia pastoris strain KM71H was then transformed with the plasmid and the recombinant protein (rCmPI-II) was expressed in benchtop fermenter in unlabeled or (15)N-labeled forms using ammonium chloride ((15)N, 99%) as the sole nitrogen source. Protein purification was accomplished by sequential cation exchange chromatography in STREAMLINE DirectHST, anion exchange chromatography on Hitrap Q-Sepharose FF and gel filtration on Superdex 75 10/30, yielding high quantities of pure rCmPI-II and (15)N rCmPI-II. Recombinant proteins displayed similar functional features as compared to the natural inhibitor and NMR spectra indicated folded and homogeneously labeled samples, suitable for further studies of structure and protease-inhibitor interactions.</p></details><hr><h4>Penicillium purpurogenum produces a highly stable endo-beta-(1,4)-galactanase.</h4><p>V.

The filamentous fungus Penicillium purpurogenum, which grows on a number of natural carbon sources, among them sugar beet pulp which contains pectin, has a gene (ppgal1) coding an endo-beta-1,4-galactanase (PpGAL1). This enzyme was expressed heterologously in Pichia pastoris. It has a molecular mass of 38 kDa, a pH optimum of 4-4.5, and an optimal temperature of 60 degrees C. It is 100 % stable for up to 24 h at pH 4-4.5 and 40 degrees C. These stability properties, which exceed those from other endo-beta-1,4-galactanases reported to date, make it particularly suitable for industrial processes requiring acidic conditions and temperatures up to 40 degrees C. PpGAL1 is, therefore, a potentially effective tool in the food industry and in other biotechnological applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris mutants as host strains for efficient secretion of recombinant branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT).</h4><p>K.

The expression and subsequent secretion of BCAT counteracts limited cell permeability of target substrates and facilitates downstream processing. Since Pichia pastoris secretes a negligible amount of native proteins and was previously shown to efficiently secrete recombinant proteins, it was chosen as the expression host. We examined different promoters and glycosylation states and also engineered the host strain by disrupting genes encoding proteins related to cell wall assembly (Scw10, Cwp1) and glycosylation (Och1). Finally, we were able not only to increase the extracellular BCAT production, but also to achieve a more homogenous product in terms of glycosylation and identified a deletion strain, which counteracts typical cell clustering in the Deltaoch1 strain.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization and biotechnological application of recombinant xylanases from Aspergillus nidulans.</h4><p>G.

XlnB and XlnC achieved maximal activities at 60 degrees C and pH 7.5 and at 50 degrees C and pH 6.0, respectively. XlnB showed to be very thermostable by maintaining 50% of its original activity after 49h incubated at 50 degrees C. XlnB had its highest activity against wheat arabinoxylan while XlnC had the best activity against beechwood xylan. Both enzymes were completely inhibited by SDS and HgCl2. Xylotriose at 1mg/ml also totally inibited XlnB activity. TLC analysis showed that the main product of beechwood xylan hydrolysis by XlnB and XlnC was xylotetraose. An additive effect was shown between XlnB and XlnC and the xylanases of two tested commercial cocktails. Sugarcane bagasse saccharification results showed that these two commercial enzymatic cocktails were able to release more glucose and xylose after supplementation with XlnB and XlnC.</p></details><hr><h4>A thermostable GH26 endo-beta-mannanase from Myceliophthora thermophila capable of enhancing lignocellulose degradation.</h4><p>C.

The optimum pH and temperature for the enzymatic activity of MtMan26A were 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. MtMan26A showed high specific activity against konjac glucomannan and carob galactomannan, while it also exhibited high thermal stability with a half-life of 14.4 h at 60 degrees C. Thermostability is of great importance, especially in industrial processes where harsh conditions are employed. With the aim of better understanding its structure-function relationships, a homology model of MtMan26A was constructed, based on the crystallographic structure of a close homologue. Finally, the addition of MtMan26A as a supplement to the commercial enzyme mixture Celluclast(R) 1.5 L and Novozyme(R) 188 resulted in enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated beechwood sawdust, improving the release of total reducing sugars and glucose by 13 and 12 %, respectively.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhanced cell-surface display and secretory production of cellulolytic enzymes with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sed1 signal peptide.</h4><p>K.

A crucial step for cell wall localization of the enzymes is the intracellular transport of proteins in yeast cells. Therefore, the addition of a highly efficient secretion signal sequence is important to increase the amount of the enzymes on the yeast cell surface. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel signal peptide (SP) sequence derived from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SED1 gene for cell-surface display and secretory production of cellulolytic enzymes. Gene cassettes with SP sequences derived from S. cerevisiae SED1 (SED1SP), Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase (GLUASP), and S. cerevisiae alpha-mating pheromone (MFalpha1SP) were constructed for cell-surface display of Aspergillus aculeatus beta-glucosidase (BGL1) and Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II (EGII). These gene cassettes were integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome. The recombinant strains with the SED1SP showed higher cell-surface BGL and EG activities than those with the conventional SP sequences (GLUASP and MFalpha1SP). The novel SP sequence also improved the secretory production of BGL and EG in S. cerevisiae. The extracellular BGL activity of the recombinant strains with the SED1SP was 1.3- and 1.9-fold higher than the GLUASP and MFalpha1SP strains, respectively. Moreover, the utilization of SED1SP successfully enhanced the secretory production of BGL in Pichia pastoris. The utilization of the novel SP sequence is a promising option for highly efficient cell-surface display and secretory production of heterologous proteins in various yeast species. Biotechnol.

A chlorogenic acid esterase from this basidiomycete was expressed in good yields cultivating the heterologous host Pichia pastoris on the 5L bioreactor scale (reUmChlE; 45.9UL(-1)). In contrast to previously described chlorogenic acid esterases, the reUmChlE was also active towards feruloylated saccharides. The enzyme preferred substrates with the ferulic acid esterified to the O-5 position of arabinose residues, typical of graminaceous monocots, over the O-2 position of arabinose or the O-6 position of galactose residues. Determination of kcat/Km showed that the reUmChlE hydrolyzed chlorogenic acid 18-fold more efficiently than methyl ferulate, p-coumarate or caffeate. Phenolic acids were released by reUmChlE from natural substrates, such as destarched wheat bran, sugar beet pectin and coffee pulp. Treatment of wheat dough using reUmChlE resulted in a noticeable softening indicating a potential application of the enzyme in bakery and confectionery.</p></details><hr><h4>Biomass estimation in Pichia pastoris cultures by combined single-wavelength fluorescence measurements.</h4><p>V.

The chemometric tools for biomass estimation were multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and principal component regression (PCR). Variable importance in the projection (VIP) scores were used to rate the importance of model input variables, indicating tryptophan as the most important variable for biomass estimation. A direct correlation between the single fluorescence signals of tryptophan and biomass was additionally set up. Results indicate a successful fitting of the MLR, PLSR, PCR, and direct tryptophan correlation models for the present case and confirm the relevance of biogenic fluorophores for bioprocess state variables monitoring. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) between the predicted and measured values for the validation batches was 0.017, 0.023, 0.025, and 0.049 g L(-1) dry cell weight for MLR, PLSR, PCR, and direct tryptophan correlation, respectively. The presented approach of indirectly measuring biomass based on combined single-wavelength fluorescence measurements can be used for the development of a low-cost alternative to 2D fluorescence spectroscopy.

Alvarez-Rueda et al., Med Mycol 54 764 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143634>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Resistance to fluconazole antifungal is an ongoing impediment to a successful treatment of Candida albicans infections. One of the most prevalent mechanisms leading to azole resistance is genetic alterations of the 14alpha-demethylase, the target of azole antifungals, through point mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling of 14alpha-demethylase rationalize biological data about the role of protein substitutions in the azole treatment failure. In this work, we investigated the role of N136Y substitution by site-directed mutagenesis into Pichia pastoris guided by structural analysis. Single amino acid substitutions were created by site-directed mutagenesis into P. pastoris with C. albicans ERG11 gene as template. In vitro susceptibility of P. pastoris transformants expressing wild-type and mutants to azole compounds was determined by CLSI M27-A2 and spot agar methods. The fluconazole effect on ergosterol biosynthesis was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. By microdilution and spot tests, N136Y transformants showed a reduced in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole compared to wild-type controls. As expected, ergosterol/lanosterol ratios were higher in N136Y transformants compared to the wild-type controls after treatment with fluconazole. Molecular modeling suggests that residue Asn136 located within the first mutation hot spot, could play a role during heme and azole binding. These results provide new insights into the structural basis for 14alpha-demethylase-azole interaction and could guide the design of novel azole antifungals.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory production of designed multipeptides displayed on a thermostable bacterial thioredoxin scaffold in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>G. Spagnoli et al., Protein Expr Purif 129 150 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27133916>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Internal grafting of designed peptides to scaffold proteins is a valuable strategy for a variety of applications including recombinant peptide antigen construction. A peptide epitope from human papillomavirus (HPV) minor capsid protein L2 displayed on thioredoxin (Trx) has been validated preclinically as a broadly protective and low-cost alternative HPV vaccine. Focusing on thioredoxin from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrx) as a scaffold, we have constructed a modified Pichia pastoris expression vector and used a PfTrx fusion derivative containing three tandemly repeated copies of a 19 amino acids peptide epitope from HPV-L2 for expression optimization and biochemical-immunological characterization of the Pichia-produced PfTrx-L2 antigen. We show that PfTrx-L2 is produced at high levels (up to 100 mg from a 100 ml starting culture using a multi-cycle induction protocol) and secreted into the culture medium as a highly enriched (>70% pure), non-glycosylated polypeptide that can be purified to homogeneity in a single step. Oxidation and aggregation state, thermal stability and immunogenicity of the endotoxin-free PfTrx-L2 antigen produced in P. pastoris were tested and found to be identical to those of the same antigen produced in Escherichia coli. Secretory production of endotoxin-free PfTrx-peptides in P. pastoris represents a cost- and time-effective alternative to E. coli production. Specifically designed for peptide antigens, the PfTrx-expression vector and conditions described herein are easily transferable to a variety of applications centred on the use of structurally constrained bioactive peptides as immune as well as target-specific binder reagents.</p></details><hr><h4>Refined Pichia pastoris reference genome sequence.</h4><p>L. Sturmberger et al., J Biotechnol 235 121 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27084056>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Strains of the species Komagataella phaffii are the most frequently used "Pichia pastoris" strains employed for recombinant protein production as well as studies on peroxisome biogenesis, autophagy and secretory pathway analyses. Genome sequencing of several different P. pastoris strains has provided the foundation for understanding these cellular functions in recent genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics experiments. This experimentation has identified mistakes, gaps and incorrectly annotated open reading frames in the previously published draft genome sequences. Here, a refined reference genome is presented, generated with genome and transcriptome sequencing data from multiple P. pastoris strains. Twelve major sequence gaps from 20 to 6000 base pairs were closed and 5111 out of 5256 putative open reading frames were manually curated and confirmed by RNA-seq and published LC-MS/MS data, including the addition of new open reading frames (ORFs) and a reduction in the number of spliced genes from 797 to 571. One chromosomal fragment of 76kbp between two previous gaps on chromosome 1 and another 134kbp fragment at the end of chromosome 4, as well as several shorter fragments needed re-orientation. In total more than 500 positions in the genome have been corrected. This reference genome is presented with new chromosomal numbering, positioning ribosomal repeats at the distal ends of the four chromosomes, and includes predicted chromosomal centromeres as well as the sequence of two linear cytoplasmic plasmids of 13.1 and 9.5kbp found in some strains of P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Combining expression and process engineering for high-quality production of human sialyltransferase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C. Luley-Goedl et al., J Biotechnol 235 54 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018228>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The human beta-galactoside alpha2,6-sialyltransferase I, ST6Gal-I has drawn considerable interest for its use as biocatalyst for in-vitro glycoengineering of recombinantly produced therapeutic proteins. By attaching sialic acid onto the terminal galactoses of biantennary protein N-glycans, ST6Gal-I facilitates protein remodeling towards a humanized glycosylation and thus optimized efficacy in pharmacological use. Secreted expression of ST6Gal-I in Pichia pastoris is promising, but proteolysis restricts both the yield and the quality of the enzyme produced. Focusing on an N-terminally truncated (Delta108) variant of ST6Gal-I previously shown to represent a minimally sized, still active form of ST6Gal-I, we show here that protein expression engineering and optimization of bioreactor cultivation of P. pastoris KM71H (pPICZalphaB) synergized to enhance the maximum enzyme titer about 57-fold to 17units/L. N-Terminal fusion to the Flag-tag plus deletion of a potential proteolytic site (Lys(114)-Asn-->Gln(114)-Asn) improved the intrinsic resistance of Delta108ST6Gal-I to degradation in P. pastoris culture. A mixed glycerol/methanol feeding protocol for P. pastoris growth and induction was key for enzyme production in high yield and quality. The sialyltransferase was recovered from the bioreactor culture in a yield of 70% using a single step of anion-exchange chromatography. Its specific activity was 0.05units/mg protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Combinatorial optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 expression enables precision genome engineering in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A. Weninger et al., J Biotechnol 235 139 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015975>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is one of the most commonly used expression systems for heterologous protein production. However the recombination machinery in P. pastoris is less effective in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where efficient homologous recombination naturally facilitates genetic modifications. The lack of simple and efficient methods for gene disruption and specifically integrating cassettes has remained a bottleneck for strain engineering in P. pastoris. Therefore tools and methods for targeted genome modifications are of great interest. Here we report the establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies for P. pastoris and demonstrate targeting efficiencies approaching 100%. However there appeared to be a narrow window of optimal conditions required for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 function for this host. We systematically tested combinations of various codon optimized DNA sequences of CAS9, different gRNA sequences, RNA Polymerase III and RNA Polymerase II promoters in combination with ribozymes for the expression of the gRNAs and RNA Polymerase II promoters for the expression of CAS9. Only 6 out of 95 constructs were functional for efficient genome editing. We used this optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene disruption studies, to introduce multiplexed gene deletions and to test the targeted integration of homologous DNA cassettes. This system allows rapid, marker-less genome engineering in P. pastoris enabling unprecedented strain and metabolic engineering applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering of Harobin for enhanced fibrinolytic activity obtained by random and site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>Z. Li et al., Protein Expr Purif 129 162 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363113>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We have previously published a report on the cloning and characterization of Harobin, a fibrinolytic serine protease. However, the broad application of this fibrinolytic enzyme is limited by its low expression level that was achieved in Pichia pastoris. To counteract this shortcoming, random and site-directed mutagenesis have been combined in order to improve functional expression and activity of Harobin. By screening 400 clones from random mutant libraries for enhanced fibrinolytic activity, two mutants were obtained: N111R, R230G. By performing site-directed mutagenesis, a Harobin double mutant, N111R/R230G, was constructed and can be functionally expressed at higher level than the wild type enzyme. In addition, it possessed much higher fibrinolytic and amidolytic activity than the wild type enzyme and other single mutants. The N111R/R230G expressed in basal salts medium was purified by a three step purification procedure. At pH of 6.0-9.0, and the temperature range of 40-90 degrees C, N111R/R230G was more active and more heat resistant. The fibrinolytic activities of Harobin mutants were completely inhibited by PMSF and SBTI, but not by EDTA, EGTA, DTT, indicating that Harobin is a serine protease. N111R/R230G showed much better anti-thrombosis effect than wild type Harobin and single mutants, and could significantly increase bleeding and clotting time. Intravenous injection of N111R/R230G in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p < 0.01), while heart rate (HR) was not affected. The in vitro and in vivo results of the present study revealed that Harobin double mutant N111R/R230G is an appropriate candidate for biotechnological applications due to its high expression level and high activity in area of thrombosis and hypertension.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous production of a feruloyl esterase from Pleurotus sapidus synthesizing feruloyl-saccharide esters.</h4><p>S. Kelle et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem 63 852 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272349>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene EST1 from the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Catalytically active recombinant Est1 was secreted using P. pastoris as a host. For expression in P. pastoris, the expression vector pPIC9K was applied. The EST1 gene was cloned with an N-terminal alpha-mating factor pre-pro sequence and expressed under the control of a methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promotor. Est1 was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant Est1 showed optima at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C, and released ferulic acid from saccharide esters and from the natural substrate destarched wheat bran. Substrate specificity profile and descriptor-based analysis demonstrated unique properties, showing that Est1 did not fit into the current FAE classification model. Transferuloylation synthesis of feruloyl-saccharide esters was proven for mono- and disaccharides.</p></details>
