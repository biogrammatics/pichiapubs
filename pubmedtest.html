Here, a new strategy was reported for improving its stable, active secretory production through engineering of its propeptide and self-degradation sites. By rationally introducing hydrophobic mutations into the N-terminus of SGT Exmt (R145I), replacing the propeptide with FPVDDDDK and engineering the alpha-factor signal peptide, trypsin production (amidase activity) was improved to 177.85+/-2.83U.mL-1 in a 3-L fermenter (a 3.75-fold increase). Subsequently, all of the residues involved in autolysis that were identified by mass spectrometry were mutated and the resulting proteins were evaluated. In particular, the variant tbcf (K101A) demonstrated high stability and production (227.65+/-6.51U.mL-1 and 185.71+/-5.68mg.L-1, respectively). The recombinant strain constructed here has great potential for large-scale production of active trypsin.</p></details><hr><h4>New lipases by mining of Pleurotus ostreatus genome.</h4><p>A. Piscitelli et al., PLoS One 12 e0185377 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945798>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The analysis of Pleurotus ostreatus genome reveals the presence of automatically annotated 53 lipase and 34 carboxylesterase putative coding-genes. Since no biochemical or physiological data are available so far, a functional approach was applied to identify lipases from P. ostreatus. In the tested growth conditions, four lipases were found expressed, with different patterns depending on the used C source. Two of the four identified proteins (PleoLip241 and PleoLip369), expressed in both analysed conditions, were chosen for further studies, such as an in silico analysis and their molecular characterization. To overcome limits linked to native production, a recombinant expression approach in the yeast Pichia pastoris was applied. Different expression levels were obtained: PleoLip241 reached a maximum activity of 4000 U/L, whereas PleoLip369 reached a maximum activity of 700 U/L. Despite their sequence similarity, these enzymes exhibited different substrate specificity and diverse stability at pH, temperature, and presence of metals, detergents and organic solvents. The obtained data allowed classifying PleoLip241 as belonging to the "true lipase" family. Indeed, by phylogenetic analysis the two proteins fall in different clusters. PleoLip241 was used to remove the hydrophobic layer from wool surface in order to improve its dyeability. The encouraging results obtained with lipase treated wool led to forecast PleoLip241 applicability in this field.</p></details><hr><h4>Biological function of Dictyocaulus viviparus asparaginyl peptidase legumain-1 and its suitability as a vaccine target.</h4><p>J. Holzhausen et al., Parasitology  1 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942744>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The present study characterized the biological function of the asparaginyl peptidase legumain-1 (LEG-1) of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus and its suitability as a recombinant vaccine against dictyocaulosis. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed LEG-1 to be almost exclusively transcribed and expressed in parasitic lungworm stages. Immunohistochemistry localized the enzyme in the parasite's gut, which was confirmed by immunoblots detecting LEG-1 in the gut as well as male testes. LEG-1 was recombinantly (rLEG-1) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and subsequently analysed in activity assays for its enzyme functions and substrate specificity. For sufficient functionality, rLEG-1 needed trans-activation through D. viviparus cathepsin L-2, indicating a novel mechanism of legumain activation. After trans-activation, rLEG-1 worked best at pH 5.5 and 35-39 degrees C and cleaved a legumain-specific artificial substrate as well as the natural substrates bovine collagen types I and II. In a clinical vaccination trial, rLEG-1 did not protect against challenge infection. Results of in vitro characterization, transcription pattern and localization enhance the presumption that LEG-1 participates in digestion processes of D. viviparus. Since rLEG-1 needs trans-activation through a cathepsin, it is probably involved in an enzyme cascade and therefore remains interesting as a candidate in a multi-component vaccine.</p></details><hr><h4>Antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities of insect defensins-DLP2 and DLP4 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</h4><p>Z. Li et al., Sci Rep 7 12124 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935900>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are the most frequent cause of sepsis, which urgently demanding new drugs for treating infection. Two homologous insect CSalphabeta peptides-DLP2 and DLP4 from Hermetia illucens were firstly expressed in Pichia pastoris, with the yields of 873.5 and 801.3 mg/l, respectively. DLP2 and DLP4 displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria especially MRSA and had greater potency, faster killing, and a longer postantibiotic effect than vancomycin. A 30-d serial passage of MRSA in the presence of DLP2/DLP4 failed to produce resistant mutants. Macromolecular synthesis showed that DLP2/DLP4 inhibited multi-macromolecular synthesis especially for RNA. Flow cytometry and electron microscopy results showed that the cell cycle was arrested at R-phase; the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall were broken by DLP2/DLP4; mesosome-like structures were observed in MRSA. At the doses of 37.5 mg/kg DLP2 or DLP4, the survival of mice challenged with MRSA were 80100%. DLP2 and DLP4 reduced the bacterial translocation burden over 95% in spleen and kidneys; reduced serum pro-inflammatory cytokines levels; promoted anti-inflammatory cytokines levels; and ameliorated lung and spleen injury. These data suggest that DLP2 and DLP4 may be excellent candidates for novel antimicrobial peptides against staphylococcal infections.</p></details><hr><h4>Going Native: direct high throughput screening of secreted full-length IgG antibodies against cell membrane proteins.</h4><p>Y. Fang, T. H. Chu, M. E. Ackerman, K. E. Griswold, MAbs  0 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933630>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Gel microdroplet - fluorescence activated cell sorting (GMD-FACS) is an innovative high throughput screening platform for recombinant protein libraries, and we show here that GMD-FACS can overcome many of the limitations associated with conventional screening methods for antibody libraries. For example, phage and cell surface display benefit from exceptionally high throughput, but generally require high quality, soluble antigen target and necessitate the use of anchored antibody fragments. In contrast, the GMD-FACS assay can screen for soluble, secreted, full-length IgGs at rates of several thousand clones per second, and the technique enables direct screening against membrane protein targets in their native cellular context. In proof-of-concept experiments, rare anti-EGFR antibody clones were efficiently enriched from a 10,000-fold excess of anti-CCR5 clones in just three days. Looking forward, GMD-FACS has the potential to contribute to antibody discovery and engineering for difficult targets, such as ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression and characterization of a novel cutinase from Malbranchea cinnamomea suitable for butyl butyrate production.</h4><p>X. Duan et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 223 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932264>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Butyl butyrate has been considered as a promising fuel source because it is a kind of natural ester which can be converted from renewable and sustainable lignocellulosic biomass. Compared with the conventional chemical methods for butyl butyrate production, the enzymatic approach has been demonstrated to be more attractive, mainly owing to the mild reaction conditions, high specificity, low energy consumption, and environmental friendliness. Cutinases play an important role in the butyl butyrate production process. However, the production level of cutinases is still relatively low. Thus, to identify novel cutinases suitable for butyl butyrate synthesis and enhance their yields is of great value in biofuel industry.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A novel cutinase gene (McCut) was cloned from a thermophilic fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The highest cutinase activity of 12, 536 U/mL was achieved in 5-L fermentor, which is by far the highest production for a cutinase. McCut was optimally active at pH 8.0 and 45 degrees C. It exhibited excellent stability within the pH range of 3.0-10.5 and up to 75 degrees C. The cutinase displayed broad substrate specificity with the highest activity towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate and tributyrin. It was capable of hydrolyzing cutin, polycaprolactone, and poly(butylene succinate). Moreover, McCut efficiently synthesized butyl butyrate with a maximum esterification efficiency of 96.9% at 4 h. The overall structure of McCut was resolved as a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. The structural differences between McCut and Aspergillus oryzae cutinase in groove and loop provide valuable information for redesign of McCut. These excellent features make it useful in biosynthesis and biodegradation fields.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A novel cutinase from M. cinnamomea was identified and characterized for the first time. High-level expression by P. pastoris is by far the highest for a cutinase. The enzyme exhibited excellent stability and high esterification efficiency for butyl butyrate production, which may make it a good candidate in biofuel and chemical industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of a fermentation process for the production of two PfAMA1-DiCo-based malaria vaccine candidates in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Kastilan et al., Sci Rep 7 11991 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931852>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a simple and powerful expression platform that has the ability to produce a wide variety of recombinant proteins, ranging from simple peptides to complex membrane proteins. A well-established fermentation strategy is available comprising three main phases: a batch phase, followed by a glycerol fed-batch phase that increases cell density, and finally an induction phase for product expression using methanol as the inducer. We previously used this three-phase strategy at the 15-L scale to express three different AMA1-DiCo-based malaria vaccine candidates to develop a vaccine cocktail. For two candidates, we switched to a two-phase strategy lacking the intermediate glycerol fed-batch phase. The new strategy not only provided a more convenient process flow but also achieved 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold higher space-time yields for the two candidates, respectively, and simultaneously reduced the final cell mass by a factor of 1.3, thus simplifying solid-liquid separation. This strategy also reduced the quantity of host cell proteins that remained to be separated from the two vaccine candidates (by 34% and 13%, respectively), thus reducing the effort required in the subsequent purification steps. Taken together, our new fermentation strategy increased the overall fermentation performance for the production of two different AMA1-DiCo-based vaccine candidates.</p></details><hr><h4>Role of induced glutathione-S-transferase from Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) HaGST-8 in detoxification of pesticides.</h4><p>C. P. Labade et al., Ecotoxicol Environ Saf 147 612 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923727>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The present study deals with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) based detoxification of pesticides in Helicoverpa armigera and its potential application in eliminating pesticides from the environment. Dietary exposure of a pesticide mixture (organophosphates - chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, pyrethroid - cypermethrin; 2-15ppm each) to H. armigera larvae resulted in a dose dependant up-regulation of GST activity and gene expression. A variant GST from H. armigera (HaGST-8) was isolated from larvae fed with 10ppm pesticide mixture and it was recombinantly expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris HaGST-8). HaGST-8 had a molecular mass of 29kDa and was most active at pH 9 at 30 degrees C. GC-MS and LC-HRMS analysis validated that HaGST-8 was effective in eliminating organophosphate type of pesticides and partially reduced the cypermethrin content (53%) from aqueous solutions. Unlike the untransformed yeast, P. pastoris HaGST-8 grew efficiently in media supplemented with pesticide mixtures (200 and 400ppm each pesticide) signifying the detoxification ability of HaGST-8. The amino acid sequence of HaGST-8 and the already reported sequence of HaGST-7 had just 2 mismatches. The studies on molecular interaction strengths revealed that HaGST-8 had stronger binding affinities with organophosphate, pyrethroid, organochloride, carbamate and neonicotinoid type of pesticides. The abilities of recombinant HaGST-8 to eliminate pesticides and P. pastoris HaGST-8 to grow profusely in the presence of high level of pesticide content can be applied for removal of such residues from food, water resources and bioremediation.</p></details><hr><h4>Evaluating Potential Risks of Food Allergy and Toxicity of Soy Leghemoglobin Expressed in Pichia Pastoris.</h4><p>Y. Jin et al., Mol Nutr Food Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28921896>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>SCOPE:</strong> The Soybean (Glycine max) leghemoglobin c2 (LegHb) gene was introduced into Pichia pastoris yeast for sustainable production of a heme-carrying protein, for organoleptic use in plant-based meat. The potential allergenicity and toxicity of LegHb and 17 Pichia host-proteins each representing >/=1% of total protein in production batches were evaluated by literature review, bioinformatics sequence comparisons to known allergens or toxins, and in vitro pepsin digestion.</p><p><strong> METHODS AND RESULTS:</strong> Literature searches found no evidence of allergenicity or toxicity for these proteins. There were no significant sequence matches of LegHb to known allergens or toxins. Eleven Pichia proteins had modest identity matches to minor environmental allergens and thirteen Pichia proteins had significant matches to proteins from toxic sources. Yet the matched allergens and toxins had similar matches to proteins from the commonly consumed yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, without evidence of food allergy or toxicity. The demonstrated history of safe use indicates additional tests for allergenicity and toxicity are not needed. The LegHb and Pichia sp. proteins were rapidly digested by pepsin at pH 2.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> These results demonstrate that foods containing recombinant soy LegHb produced in Pichia sp. are unlikely to present an unacceptable risk of allergenicity or toxicity to consumers.

Ladeveze et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 215 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28919928>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a class of powerful oxidative enzymes that have revolutionized our understanding of lignocellulose degradation. Fungal LPMOs of the AA9 family target cellulose and hemicelluloses. AA9 LPMO-coding genes have been identified across a wide range of fungal saprotrophs (Ascomycotina, Basidiomycotina, etc.), but so far they have not been found in more basal lineages. Recent genome analysis of the yeast Geotrichum candidum (Saccharomycotina) revealed the presence of several LPMO genes, which belong to the AA9 family.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, three AA9 LPMOs from G. candidum were successfully produced and biochemically characterized. The use of native signal peptides was well suited to ensure correct processing and high recombinant production of GcLPMO9A, GcLPMO9B, and GcLPMO9C in Pichia pastoris. We show that GcLPMO9A and GcLPMO9B were both active on cellulose and xyloglucan, releasing a mixture of soluble C1- and C4-oxidized oligosaccharides from cellulose. All three enzymes disrupted cellulose fibers and significantly improved the saccharification of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass upon addition to a commercial cellulase cocktail.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The unique enzymatic arsenal of G. candidum compared to other yeasts could be beneficial for plant cell wall decomposition in a saprophytic or pathogenic context. From a biotechnological point of view, G. candidum LPMOs are promising candidates to further enhance enzyme cocktails used in biorefineries such as consolidated bioprocessing.</p></details><hr><h4>Quantification of the Intracellular Life Time of Water Molecules to Measure Transport Rates of Human Aquaglyceroporins.</h4><p>M. Palmgren et al., J Membr Biol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28914342>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Orthodox aquaporins are transmembrane channel proteins that facilitate rapid diffusion of water, while aquaglyceroporins facilitate the diffusion of small uncharged molecules such as glycerol and arsenic trioxide. Aquaglyceroporins play important roles in human physiology, in particular for glycerol metabolism and arsenic detoxification. We have developed a unique system applying the strain of the yeast Pichia pastoris, where the endogenous aquaporins/aquaglyceroporins have been removed and human aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are recombinantly expressed enabling comparative permeability measurements between the expressed proteins. Using a newly established Nuclear Magnetic Resonance approach based on measurement of the intracellular life time of water, we propose that human aquaglyceroporins are poor facilitators of water and that the water transport efficiency is similar to that of passive diffusion across native cell membranes. This is distinctly different from glycerol and arsenic trioxide, where high glycerol transport efficiency was recorded.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and Characteristics of a Novel Xylose- and Alkali-tolerant GH 43 beta-xylosidase from Penicillium oxalicum for Promoting Hemicellulose Degradation.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, a novel intracellular glycoside hydrolase family 43 beta-xylosidase gene (xyl43) from Penicillium oxalicum 114-2 was successfully high-level overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and the secreted enzyme was characterized. The beta-xylosidase Xyl43 exhibited great pH stability and high catalytic activity in the range of pH 6.0 to 8.0, and high tolerance to xylose with the Ki value of 28.09 mM. The Xyl43 could effectively promote enzymatic degradation of different source of xylan and hemicellulose contained in alkaline-pretreated corn stover, and high conversion of xylan to xylose could be obtained.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel bi-directional promoter system allows tunable recombinant protein production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>V. Rajamanickam, K. Metzger, C. Schmid, O. Spadiut, Microb Cell Fact 16 152 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903770>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a well-studied host organism for recombinant protein production, which is usually regulated either by a constitutive promoter (e.g. promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGAP) or an inducible promoter (e.g. promoter of alcohol oxidase 1; PAOX1). Both promoter systems have several advantages and disadvantages; with one of the main disadvantages being their lack of tunability. Various novel promoter systems, which are either inducible or de-repressed, allowing higher degrees of freedom, have been reported. Recently, bi-directional promoter systems in P. pastoris with two promoter systems regulating recombinant expression of one or more genes were developed. In this study, we introduce a novel bi-directional promoter system combining a modified catalase promoter system (PDC; derepressible and inducible) and the traditional PAOX1, allowing tunable recombinant protein production.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We characterized a recombinant P. pastoris strain, carrying the novel bi-directional promoter system, during growth and production in three dynamic bioreactor cultivations. We cloned the model enzyme cellobiohydralase downstream of either promoter and applied different feeding strategies to determine the physiological boundaries of the strain. We succeeded in demonstrating tunability of recombinant protein production solely in response to the different feeding strategies and identified a mixed feed regime allowing highest productivity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this feasibility study, we present the first controlled bioreactor experiments with a recombinant P. pastoris strain carrying a novel bi-directional promotor combination of a catalase promoter variant (PDC) and the traditional PAOX1. We demonstrated that this bi-directional promoter system allows tunable recombinant protein expression only in response to the available C-sources. This bi-directional promoter system offers a high degree of freedom for bioprocess design and development, making bi-directional promoters in P. pastoris highly attractive for recombinant protein production.</p></details><hr><h4>COMPARATIVE PHYSIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF HYDROPHOBINS PRODUCED IN ESCHERICHIA COLI AND PICHIA PASTORIS.</h4><p>A. Przylucka et al., Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces 159 913 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903187>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hydrophobins (HFBs) are small surface-active proteins secreted by filamentous fungi. Being amphiphilic, they spontaneously form layers that convert surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and vice versa. We have compared properties of the class II HFB4 and HFB7 from Trichoderma virens as produced in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Since the production in E. coli required denaturation/renaturation steps because of inclusion bodies, this treatment was also applied to HFBs produced and secreted in yeast. The protein yields for both systems were similar. Both HFBs produced by E. coli proved less active on PET compared to HFBs produced in P. pastoris. HFBs produced in E. coli decreased the hydrophilicity of glass the most, which correlated with the adsorption of a more dense protein layer on glass compared to HFBs produced in P. pastoris. The hydrophobins produced in P. pastoris formed highly structured monolayers. Layers of hydrophobins produced in E. coli were less prone to self-organization. Our data suggests that irrespective of the production host, the HFBs could be used in various applications that are based on their surface activity. However, the production host and the subsequent purification procedure will influence the stability of HFB layers. In the area of high-value biomedical devices and nanomaterials, where the formation of highly ordered protein monolayers is essential, our results point to P. pastoris as the preferred production host. Furthermore, the choice of an appropriate hydrophobin for a given application appears to be equally important.</p></details><hr><h4>Double promoter expression systems for recombinant protein production by industrial microorganisms.</h4><p>S. Ozturk, B. G. Ergun, P. Calik, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28900685>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Using double promoter expression systems is a promising approach to increase heterologous protein production. In this review, current double promoter expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins (r-proteins) by industrially important bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli; and yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, are discussed by assessing their potentials and drawbacks. Double promoter expression systems need to be designed to maintain a higher specific product formation rate within the production domain. While bacterial double promoter systems have been constructed as chimeric tandem promoters, yeast dual promoter systems have been developed as separate expression cassettes. To increase production and productivity, the optimal transcriptional activity should be justified either by simultaneously satisfying the requirements of both promoters, or by consecutively stimulating the changeover from one to another in a biphasic process or via successive-iterations. Thus, considering the dynamics of a fermentation process, double promoters can be classified according to their operational mechanisms, as: i) consecutively operating double promoter systems, and ii) simultaneously operating double promoter systems. Among these metabolic design strategies, extending the expression period with two promoters activated under different conditions, or enhancing the transcriptional activity with two promoters activated under similar conditions within the production domain, can be applied independently from the host. Novel studies with new insights, which aim a rational systematic design and construction of dual promoter expression vectors with tailored transcriptional activity, will empower r-protein production with enhanced production and productivity. Finally, the current state-of-the-art review emphasizes the advantages of double promoter systems along with the necessity for discovering new promoters for the development of more effective and adaptive processes to meet the increasing demand of r-protein industry.</p></details><hr><h4>Glycosylation is important for FcXTH1 activity as judged by its structural and biochemical characterization.</h4><p>A. Mendez-Yanez et al., Plant Physiol Biochem 119 200 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28898745>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (XTH) may have endotransglycosylase (XET) and/or hydrolase (XEH) activities. Previous studies suggest that XTHs might play a key role in ripening of Fragaria chiloensis fruit as FcXTH1 transcripts increase as fruit softens. FcXTH1 protein sequence contains a conserved N-glycosylation site adjacent to catalytic residues. The FcXTH1 structure was built through comparative modeling methodology, the structure displays a beta-jellyroll-type folding with a curvature generated by eight antiparallel beta-sheets that holds the catalytic motif that is oriented towards the central cavity of the protein. Through Molecular Dynamic Simulations (MDS) analyses the protein-ligand interactions of FcXTH1 were explored, finding a better interaction with xyloglucans than cellulose. Nevertheless, the stability of the protein-ligand complex depends on the glycosylation state of FcXTH1: better energy interactions were determined for the glycosylated protein. As a complement, the molecular cloning and heterologous expression of FcXTH1 in Pichia pastoris was performed, and the recombinant protein was active and displayed strict XET activity. A KM value of 17.0 muM was determined for xyloglucan oligomer. The deglycosylation of FcXTH1 by PNGase-F treatment affects its biochemical properties (increase KM and reduce kcat/KM ratio) and reduces its stability. As a conclusion, glycosylation of FcXTH1 is important for its biological function.</p></details><hr><h4>[Construction of Setosphaeria turcica STK1-EGFP fusion gene vector and its expression in Pichia pastoris].</h4><p>Y.

At first, the Pichia pastoris GS115 expression vector pPIC3.5K-EGFP containing enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP) was constructed, then STK1 gene was first amplified by PCR with the template of cDNA of S. turcica model isolate 01-23, and then cloned into the vector pPIC3.5K-EGFP with enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP) to construct the STK1-EGFP fusion gene expression vector pPIC3.5K-STK1-EGFP. The vector was transformed into the susceptible cells of Pichia pastoris GS115 by electric shock process, and the transformants were identified by MD medium screening and PCR determination. The STK1 gene and EGFP gene could be expressed effectively and stably in the transformants as detected by RT-PCR and fluorescence observation. In addition, we also found that the Kozak sequence before the start codon of STK1 gene could increase 4.8 folds expression level of STK1- EGFP fusion gene. The above research results laid a good foundation for subcellular localization and antibody preparation of STK1 protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Recycling of a selectable marker with a self-excisable plasmid in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C. Li et al., Sci Rep 7 11113 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28894268>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a widely used heterologous protein production workhorse. However, with its multiple genetic modifications to solve bottlenecks for heterologous protein productivity, P. pastoris lacks selectable markers. Existing selectable marker recycling plasmids have drawbacks (e.g., slow growth and conditional lethality). Here, zeocin-resistance marker recycling vectors were constructed using the Cre/loxP recombination system. The vectors were used to (i) knock in heterologous phytase, xylanase and lipase expression cassettes, (ii) increase the phytase, xylanase and lipase gene copy number to 13, 5, and 5, respectively, with vector introduction and (iii) engineer the secretion pathway by co-overexpressing secretion helper factors (Sly1p and Sec1p) without introducing selectable markers, giving a phytase field of 0.833 g/L. The vectors allow selectable marker recycling and would be a useful tool to engineer P. pastoris for high heterologous protein productivity.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of stable and active human DNA topoisomerase I in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. K. Chan et al., Protein Expr Purif 141 52 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893606>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study described the isolation of the coding region of human topoisomerase I (TopoI) from MDA-MB-231 and the expression of multiple copy recombinant genes in four Pichia pastoris strains. First, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplification of the enzyme coding region was performed. The PCR fragment was cloned into pPICZ-alpha-A vector and sequenced. It was then transformed into X33, GS115, SMD1168H and KM71H strains of Pichia. PCR-screening for positive clones was performed, and estimation of multiple copy integrants in each Pichia strain was carried out using agar plates containing increasing concentrations of Zeocin(R). The selected clones of multiple copy recombinant genes were then induced for TopoI expression in shaker flasks. GS115 and SMD1168 were found to be better Pichia strains to accommodate the recombinant gene for the expression of TopoI extracellularly. However, the DNA relaxation activity revealed that only the target enzyme in the culture supernatants of GS115-pPICZ-alpha-A-TopoI exhibited consistent enzyme activity over the cultivation time-points. Active enzyme activity was inhibited by Camptothecin. The enzyme produced can be used for in-house gel-based DNA relaxation assay development in performing high throughput screening for target-specific growth inhibitors that display similar effect as the TopoI inhibitors.

Blaha et al., Biotechnol Prog   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884522>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The time and cost benefits of miniaturized fermentation platforms can only be gained by employing complementary techniques facilitating high-throughput at small sample volumes. Microbial cell disruption is a major bottleneck in experimental throughput and is often restricted to large processing volumes. Moreover, for rigid yeast species such as Pichia pastoris, no effective high-throughput disruption methods exist. This study describes the development of an automated, miniaturized, high-throughput, non-contact, scalable platform based on Adaptive Focused Acoustics (AFA) to disrupt P. pastoris and recover intracellular heterologous protein. Augmented modes of AFA were established by investigating vessel designs and a novel enzymatic pre-treatment step. Three different modes of AFA were studied and compared to the performance high pressure homogenization. For each of these modes of cell disruption, response models were developed to account for five different performance criteria. Using multiple responses not only demonstrated that different operating parameters are required for different response optima, with highest product purity requiring suboptimal values for other criteria, but also allowed for AFA-based methods to mimic large-scale homogenization processes. These results demonstrate that AFA-mediated cell disruption can be used for a wide range of applications including buffer development, strain selection, fermentation process development and whole bioprocess integration.

In this study, ES products of T. muris and immune sera were produced. The immune sera recognized more than 20 proteins on a 2D-gel of ES products of T. muris adult worms. Tm16 was one of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry. Tm16 shares 57% sequence identity with Ov16, an immunodominant diagnostic antigen from Onchocerca volvulus. Recombinant Tm16 with a carboxyl terminal hexahistidine was produced using Pichia pastoris. Polyclonal antibodies against rTm16 were generated by one-prime and two-boost immunization of three female Balb/c mice with 25 mug of recombinant Tm16 emulsified with ISA720 adjuvant. These polyclonal antibodies confirmed that Tm16 is localized to the ES products and the soluble fraction of the adult worm. Additionally, the high-resolution crystal structure of Tm16 was solved by molecular replacement. Tm16 belongs to the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding-like protein (PEBP1) family and this is the first structure of a PEBP1 from a parasite.</p></details><hr><h4>[A method to increase the production of insulin precursor in Pichia pastoris].</h4><p>C.

Then, the components of SNAREs (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins), SNC2 and SNC2-SSO2, were expressed in the strain CL012 to explore the effect of SNAREs on the yield of PI. In shake flask culture, the strains expressing SNC2 and SNC2-SSO2 yielded PI of 1.89 mg/L and 2.21 mg/L after methanol induction for 96 h, which were improved by 23.53% and 44.44% compared to that of strain CL012 (1.53 mg/L), respectively. Further, in a 5-L bioreactor, the yield of PI with strain CL012 was 53 mg/L for high-density fermentation, after 96 h of methanol induction, which was 34.64-fold higher than that of shake culture. The strains expressing SNC2 and SNC2-SSO2 yielded the PI of 64 mg/L and 78 mg/L, which were respectively increased by 20.75% and 47.17%, compared to that of strain CL012. This work indicated that SNAREs components promoted the secretion of PI to improve its heterologous expression in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of the secretory expression of recombinant human C-reactive protein in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. Li et al., 3 Biotech 7 291 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868218>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Human C-reactive protein (CRP), a classical human acute-phase plasma protein, is not only a sensitive systemic inflammatory marker but also an independent risk predictor of cardiovascular diseases. However, existing heterologous expression systems for expressing CRP is not efficient and cost-effective for large-scale industrial production of CRP to meet the growing market demand for CRP. This study aims to improve the secretion of recombinant CRP by Pichia pastoris via optimizing signal peptides, promoters and carbon sources. The CRP genes with encoding four different signal peptides were designed and synthesized. The genes were cloned into pPICZalphaA or pPICZ B, respectively via splicing by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR) technology and expressed in P. pastoris X-33, regulated by the alcohol oxidase I promoter (pAOX1). The CRP led by the alpha-mating factor secretion signal peptide (alpha-MF) was secreted at the highest level in these signal peptides. Then, a constitutive construct and expression of the CRP genes were achieved by switching to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (pGAP). Subsequently, different carbon sources and at different concentrations were used to further improve the secretion of CRP. The expression of CRP with the alpha-MF driven by the pGAP gave the highest yield of secreted CRP, about 3 mg/l of culture on the optimized culture conditions. The purified recombinant CRP exhibited good immunoreactivity determined by ELISA with anti-human CRP monoclonal antibody. The efficient engineering strategy established in this work might provide potential uses in large-scale industrial production of human CRP in the future.</p></details><hr><h4>Malachite Green and Crystal Violet Decolorization by Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus Supernatant and by rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B Concentrates: Molecular Docking Analysis.</h4><p>E.

Triphenylmethane dyes are synthetic compounds widely used in diverse industries. Their removal from effluents is difficult, due to their high degree of structural complexity; hence, their high concentration in effluents cause a negative impact on the environment. In the present work, molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between rGlLCC1 or rPOXA 1B enzymes with Crystal Violet (CV) or Malachite Green (MG) dyes. In addition, removal tests of the two dyes were performed. Van der Waals interactions were obtained for only the CV dye for both GlLCC1 and POXA 1B enzymes. Nevertheless, in the GlLCC1 model, two pi-pi interactions were observed. For the MG dye only, Van der Waals interactions were obtained. Moreover, amino acid composition interacting in each model with each dye was similar. It is important to highlight that by molecular docking, none of the estimated ligand configurations generated hydrogen bonds. Thus, explaining the difficulty to degrade CV and MG. Regarding CV, maximum decolorization percentage was 23.6 +/- 1.0% using Ganoderma lucidum supernatant and 5.0 +/- 0.5% with Pleurotus ostreatus supernatant. When using recombinant laccase enzyme concentrates, decolorization percentages were 9.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.5 +/- 1.0% for rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B, respectively. On the other hand, for the MG dye, maximum decolorization percentages were 52.1 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2% using G. lucidum and P. ostreatus concentrates, respectively. Whereas with recombinant laccase enzymatic concentrates, values of 9.4 +/- 0.8% were obtained, with rGlLCC1, and 2.1 +/- 0.1% when using rPOXA 1B. These findings represent an important step in bioremediation processes improvement and efficiency of industry-generated products, using environmentally friendly alternatives.</p></details><hr><h4>Development of a general defined medium for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>C.

More than 500 proteins have been expressed in the organism at a variety of cultivation scales, from small shake flasks to large bioreactors. Large-scale fermentation strategies typically employ chemically-defined growth medium because of its greater batch-to-batch consistency and in many cases, lower costs compared to complex medium. For biopharmaceuticals, defined growth medium may also simplify downstream purification and regulatory documentation. Standard formulations of defined media for Pichia pastoris are minimal ones that lack the metabolic intermediates provided by complex components such as peptone and yeast extract. As a result, growth rates and per-cell productivities are significantly lower than in complex medium. We have designed a rich defined medium (RDM) for Pichia pastoris by systematically evaluating nutrients of increasing complexity and identifying those that are most critical for growth. We have also demonstrated that using RDM for expression of three heterologous proteins yields titers comparable to, or higher than, those in standard complex medium. Rich defined medium improves productivity of Pichia pastoris fermentations and its development demonstrates the usefulness of transcriptomics to accelerate process development for new molecules.

In this study, genes encoding the full-length (cgkZ), Por secretion tail-truncated (cgkZDeltaPst) and carbohydrate binding domain-truncated (cgkZDeltaCBM) kappa-carrageenase proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The copy numbers of gene cgkZ, cgkZDeltaPst and cgkZDeltaCBM were 7, 7 and 6, respectively. The enzymatic activities of recombinant enzymes cgkZ, cgkZDeltaPst and cgkZDeltaCBM reached 4.68, 5.70, and 3.02 U/mL, respectively, after 120 h of shake flask fermentation at 22 degrees C and pH 6 in the presence of 1 % (v/v) methanol. The molecular weights of recombinant cgkZ, cgkZDeltaPst, and cgkZDeltaCBM were approximately 65, 45, and 40 kDa; their Km values were 2.07, 1.85, and 1.04 mg/mL; and they exhibited optimal activity at 45-50 degrees C and pH 6-7. All the recombinant enzymes were stimulated by Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and dithiothreitol. The end-products of enzymatic hydrolysis were mainly composed of kappa-carrageenan tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide. The removal of the Por secretion tail of kappa-carrageenase promoted the transcription of kappa-carrageenase gene, enhancing the specific activity of kappa-carrageenase without significantly changing its catalytic properties. Although the transcription level of kappa-carrageenase gene after the removal of the carbohydrate binding domain was relatively high, the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme significantly decreased. The comprehensive application of the P. pastoris expression system combined with the rational modification of genes may provide a novel approach for the heterologous expression of various marine enzymes with high activities.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant neuritin affects the senescence, apoptosis, proliferation, and migration of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</h4><p>W.

We previously isolated the cDNA that codes for a laccase isozyme (Lac2a) from the medicinal mushroom Agaricus brasiliensis (Matsumoto-Akanuma et al., Int. J. Med. Mushrooms, 16, 375-393, 2014). In this study, we first attempted heterologous expression of the wild-type laccase using a Pichia pastoris secretory expression system. However, the trial was unsuccessful most likely because the enzyme was too unstable and degraded immediately after production. Therefore, we improved the stability of the laccase by using a phylogeny-based design method. We created a mutant laccase in which sixteen original residues were replaced with those found in the phylogenetically inferred ancestral sequence. The resulting mutant protein was successfully produced using the P. pastoris secretory expression system and then purified. The designed laccase showed catalytic properties similar to those of other fungal laccases. Moreover, the laccase is highly thermally stable at acidic and neutral pH and is also stable at alkaline pH at moderate temperatures. We expect that the laccase will serve as a useful tool for enzymatic polymerization of di-phenolic compounds.</p></details><hr><h4>Active Expression of Human Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) c-DNA from Pulmonary Metastases in the Methylotrophic Yeast Pichia Pastoris KM71H Strain</h4><p>A.

It catalyzes the activation of zymogen plasminogen to the fibrin-degrading proteinase, plasmin, leading to digestion of fibrin clots. The recombinant enzyme produced by recombinant technology issued to dissolve blood clots in treatment of various human diseases such as coronary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Pichia pastoris expression system is a unique system for the production of high level of recombinant proteins. GS115 and KM71H are two kinds of Pichia pastoris strains whilst production of recombinant proteins in these strains is not predictable. The aim of the study was evaluation of t-PA expression in KM71H strains. Methods: In this study, the cDNA of the t-PA gene was amplified by PCR, sequenced and cloned into Pichia pastoris KM71H host strain using pPICZalphaA expression vector that allows methanol-induced expression and secretion of the protein. Results: Dot blotting results confirmed the presence oft-PA in the cell supernatant. Western blotting test revealed the approximate size of 70 KDa for recombinant t-PA. Quantitative ELISA experiment showed 810 mug/L of t-PA in the supernatant samples. Zymography analysis confirmed the proteolytic activity and biological function of the expressed recombinant t-PA. Conclusions: Correspondingly, Pichia pastoris KM71H is an appropriate strain for production of active recombinant protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning and expression of the recombinant crustacean hyperglycemic hormone isoform B2 (rCHH-B2) and its effects on the metabolism and osmoregulation of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.</h4><p>L. Camacho-Jimenez et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol 253 33 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28842215>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Crustacean hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs) are multifunctional neuropeptides ubiquitous in crustaceans. In Litopenaeus vannamei, CHH-B2 is a CHH eyestalk isoform whose expression has been shown to vary with enviromental conditions, suggesting its relevance for ecophysiological performance of shrimp, controlling processes related to metabolism and osmo-ionic regulation. To study the involvement of CHH-B2 in these processes, we cloned and expressed a recombinant version with a free C-terminal glycine (rCHH-B2-Gly) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The rCHH-B2-Gly peptide secreted to the culture medium was purified by RP-HPLC and used for in vivo glucose, triglyceride, and osmoregulation dose-response analyses with juvenile shrimp. The peptide was also amidated at the C-terminus using an alpha-amidating enzyme to produce rCHH-B2-amide. The shrimp showed a dose-dependent effect of rCHH-B2-Gly to hemolymph glucose and triglyceride levels, inducing maximal increases by injecting 500 and 1000pmol of hormone, respectively. Additionally, 10pmol of hormone was sufficient to reduce the hypo-osmoregulatory capacity of shrimp at 35 per thousand. These findings suggest that CHH-B2 has regulatory roles in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and a potential involvement in osmoregulation of L. vannamei. Injection of 100pmol of rCHH-B2-amide increased glucose and triglyceride levels by 15 and 28%, respectively in comparison with rCHH-B2-Gly, suggesting an important role for the C-terminal amidation. Additionally, an in silico structural analysis done with the CHH-B1 and rCHH-B2-Gly peptides suggests that the C-terminal region may be relevant for the activity of the L. vannamei isoforms and explain the functional divergence from other crustacean CHH/CHH-like peptides.</p></details><hr><h4>A new type of gene-disruption cassette with a rescue gene for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>T. Shibui, H. Hara, Biotechnol Prog   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28840657>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris has been used for the production of many recombinant proteins, and many useful mutant strains have been created. However, the efficiency of mutant isolation by gene-targeting is usually low and the procedure is difficult for those inexperienced in yeast genetics. In order to overcome these issues, we developed a new gene-disruption system with a rescue gene using an inducible Cre/mutant-loxP system. With only short homology regions, the gene-disruption cassette of the system replaces its target-gene locus containing a mutation with a compensatory rescue gene. As the cassette contains the AOX1 promoter-driven Cre gene, when targeted strains are grown on media containing methanol, the DNA fragment, i.e., the marker, rescue and Cre genes, between the mutant-loxP sequences in the cassette is excised, leaving only the remaining mutant-loxP sequence in the genome, and consequently a target gene-disrupted mutant can be isolated. The system was initially validated on ADE2 gene disruption, where the disruption can easily be detected by color-change of the colonies. Then, the system was applied for knocking-out URA3 and OCH1 genes, reported to be difficult to accomplish by conventional gene-targeting methods. All three gene-disruption cassettes with their rescue genes replaced their target genes, and the Cre/mutant-loxP system worked well to successfully isolate their knock-out mutants. This study identified a new gene-disruption system that could be used to effectively and strategically knock out genes of interest, especially whose deletion is detrimental to growth, without using special strains, e.g., deficient in nonhomologous end-joining, in P. pastoris.

The specific detection of allergy to the venom of this wasp is often hampered by the lack of recombinant allergens currently available for molecular diagnosis. Antigen 5 (~23 kDa) from P. paulista venom (Poly p 5) is a highly abundant and glycosylated allergenic protein that could be used for development of component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Here, we describe the cloning and heterologous expression of the antigen 5 (rPoly p 5) from P. paulista venom using the eukaryotic system Pichia pastoris. The expression as a secreted protein yielded high levels of soluble rPoly p 5. The recombinant allergen was further purified to homogeneity (99%) using a two-step chromatographic procedure. Simultaneously, the native form of the allergen (nPoly p 5) was purified from the wasp venom by Ion exchange chromatography. The rPoly p 5 and nPoly p 5 were then submitted to a comparative analysis of IgE-mediated immunodetection using sera from patients previously diagnosed with sensitization to wasp venoms. Both rPoly p 5 and nPoly p 5 were recognized by specific IgE (sIgE) in the sera of the allergic individuals. The high levels of identity found between nPoly p 5 and rPoly p 5 by the alignment of its primary sequences as well as by 3-D models support the results obtained in the immunoblot. Overall, we showed that P. pastoris is a suitable system for production of soluble rPoly p 5 and that the recombinant allergen represents a potential candidate for molecular diagnosis of P.paulista venom allergy.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the catalytic characteristics of lipase-displaying yeast cells by hydrophobic modification.</h4><p>K.

Herein, we tested three methods to enhance the hydrophobicity of the surface of Candida antarctica lipase B-displaying Pichia pastoris cells, co-displaying a fungal hydrophobin, coating with ionic liquids, and adding decane as a hydrophobic carbon source during fermentation. Modified cells showed higher surface hydrophobicity and superior esterification of C6-C18 saturated fatty acids in hydrophobic solvents. When used for biodiesel synthesis, modified cells exhibited an improved initial reaction rate and equilibrium fatty acid methyl ester yield. We systematically discuss the influence of cell surface hydrophobicity on the catalytic properties, and the results provide guidance for improving the catalytic efficiency and operational characteristics of lipase-displaying yeast cells for organic bioconversions.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of the antimicrobial peptide ABP-dHC-cecropin A in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

The SacI-linearized plasmid pPICZalphaA-ABP-dHC-cecropin A was then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation. Expression was induced after a 96-h incubation with 0.5% methanol at 20 degrees C in a culture supplied with 2% casamino acids to avoid proteolysis. Under these conditions, approximately 48 mg of ABP-dHC-cecropin A was secreted into 1L (4 x 250-mL)of medium. Recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was purified using size-exclusion chromatography, and 21 mg of pure active ABP-dHC-cecropin A was obtained from 1L (4 x 250-mL)of culture. Electrophoresis on 4-20% gradient gels indicated that recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was secreted as a protein approximately 4 kDa in size. Recombinant ABP-dHC-cecropin A was successfully expressed, as the product displayed antibacterial and antifungal activities (based on an antibacterial assay, scanning electron microscopy, and antifungal assay) indistinguishable from those of the synthesized protein.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural Insights into the Mode of Action of the Peptide Antibiotic Copsin.</h4><p>M.

Because of their unique mode of action and rapid killing of pathogenic microbes, defensins are considered promising alternatives to clinically applied antibiotics. Copsin is a defensin-like peptide, previously identified in the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea. It exerts its activity against a range of Gram-positive bacteria by binding to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and prevention of proper cell wall formation. In this study, we present a new workflow for the generation, production, and activity-driven selection of copsin derivatives, based on their expression in Pichia pastoris. One hundred fifty-two single-amino acid mutants and combinations thereof allowed the identification of k-copsin, a peptide variant exhibiting significantly enhanced activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, we performed in silico characterizations of membrane interactions of copsin and k-copsin, in the presence and absence of lipid II. The molecular dynamics data highlighted a high variability in lipid II binding, with a preference for the MurNAc moiety with 47 and 35% of the total contacts for copsin and k-copsin, respectively. Mutated amino acids were located in loop regions of k-copsin and shown to be crucial in the perturbation of the bacterial membrane. These structural studies provide a better understanding of how defensins can be developed toward antibacterial therapies less prone to resistance issues.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative analysis of the effect of protein Z4 from barley malt and recombinant Pichia pastoris on beer foam stability: Role of N-glycosylation and glycation.</h4><p>C.

The malt protein Z4 and recombinant protein Z4 showed similar N-glycosylation patterns while recombinant protein Z4 was glycosylated at a higher degree. In the simulated mashing and boiling, malt protein Z4 and deglycosylated malt protein Z4 preferred to glycate with glucose and maltose while recombinant protein Z4 and deglycosylated recombinant protein Z4 showed preference towards fructose. The addition of protein Z4 and protein Z4-saccharide complexes in finished beer showed that the addition of glycosylated protein Z4 only slightly enhanced the beer foam stability while the addition of glycated protein Z4 and protein Z4 with both glycation and glycosylation could significantly increase the beer foam stability. Therefore, glycation instead of N-glycosylation of protein Z4 played important roles in maintaining beer foam stability.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of a novel thermostable Sclerotinia sclerotiorum GH45 endoglucanase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

Mainly endoglucanases were found to be a prerequisite for the quick initial biomass liquefaction. In the present study, Pichia pastoris was used as a host for the heterologous expression of a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum GH45 endoglucanase, Endo2. The recombinant plasmid pPICZalphaA was used to transform Pichia pastoris. Pichia culture supernatants expressing the recombinant Endo2 (rEndo2) were used for the purification and biochemical characterization of this enzyme. Therefore, rEndo2 was purified 6.7 fold to homogeneity with 34% yield and gave 19U/mg specific activity. It also showed maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C (against pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C for the native enzyme) and was thermostable at relatively high temperatures. Furthermore, rEndo2 retained its activity in a wide pH range (from 5 to 8). Besides, the recombinant endoglucanase was produced as an active 47kDa enzyme. This molecular weight differs from the one of the native enzyme (34kDa), which suggested a potential glycosylation of the recombinant enzyme. Moreover, rEndo2 was able to produce fermentable sugars after enzymatic assay on various cellulosic substrates with an interesting yield. Therefore, all these features offer prospects for large-scale production and industrial application of the recombinant endoglucanase.</p></details><hr><h4>The heterologous expression strategies of antimicrobial peptides in microbial systems.</h4><p>T.

However, despite of their high economic values, the low yield and the cumbersome extraction process in AMPs production are problems that limit their industrial application and scientific research. To conquer these obstacles, optimized heterologous expression technologies were developed that could provide effective ways to increase the yield of AMPs. In this review, the research progress on heterologous expression of AMPs using Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as host cells was mainly summarized, which might guide the expression strategies of AMPs in these cells.</p></details><hr><h4>The Magnaporthe oryzae Alt A 1-like protein MoHrip1 binds to the plant plasma membrane.</h4><p>Y. Zhang et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 492 55 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807829>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>MoHrip1, a protein isolated from Magnaporthe oryzae, belongs to the Alt A 1 (AA1) family. mohrip1 mRNA levels showed inducible expression throughout the infection process in rice. To determine the location of MoHrip1 in M. oryzae, a mohrip1-gfp mutant was generated. Fluorescence microscopy observations and western blotting analysis showed that MoHrip1 was both present in the secretome and abundant in the fungal cell wall. To obtain MoHrip1 protein, we carried out high-yield expression of MoHrip1 in Pichia pastoris. Treatment of tobacco plants with MoHrip1 induced the formation of necrosis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and expression of several defense-related genes, as well as conferred disease resistance. By fusion to green fluorescent protein, we showed that MoHrip1 was able to bind to the tobacco and rice plant plasma membrane, causing rapid morphological changes at the cellular level, such as cell shrinkage and chloroplast disorganization. These findings indicate that MoHrip1 is a microbe-associated molecular pattern that is perceived by the plant immune system. This is the first study on an AA1 family protein that can bind to the plant plasma membrane.</p></details><hr><h4>The versatile functions of LRR-only proteins in mollusk Chlamys farreri.</h4><p>M.

In the present study, three novel LRR-only proteins, CfLRRop-4, CfLRRop-5 and CfLRRop-6, were identified and characterized from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. They all contained LRR motifs with consensus signature sequences of LxxLxLxxNxL or LxxLxLxxCxxL. All the mRNA transcripts of three CfLRRops were high abundant in hepatopancreas, gills and gonads, and their mRNA transcripts in hemocytes could respond to the stimulations of different microbes, including Vibrio anguillarum, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. These three CfLRRops exhibited similar ligand binding and recognition characteristics as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). The immune effectors, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, superoxide dismutase, catalase and lysozyme, varied significantly after the scallops were stimulated by recombinant LRR-only proteins. All these results indicated that LRR-only proteins are functionally differentiated and exhibit different immunomodulation activities on various downstream immune effectors.</p></details><hr><h4>UBX domain-containing proteins are involved in lipid homeostasis and stress responses in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Zhang et al., Int J Biochem Cell Biol 90 136 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807601>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing proteins constitute a family of proteins and are substrate adaptors of AAA ATPase Cdc48. UBX proteins can bind to the N-terminal region of Cdc48 to perform endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this study, we identified two UBX domain-containing proteins, Ubx1 and Ubx2, in Pichia pastoris and found that the two proteins could recover the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in ubx2Delta. Our results revealed that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play critical roles in synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by affecting Spt23. In addition, the results demonstrated that both Ubx1 and Ubx2 are involved in lipid droplet formation and protein degradation. Deletion of UBX1 led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and disruption of UBX2 impaired cell viability under osmotic stress. The phenotypes of ubx1Delta+UBX2, ubx2Delta+UBX1 and ubx1Deltaubx2Delta and RNA-seq data suggested that Ubx1 and Ubx2 play different roles in cell functions, and the roles of Ubx1 may be more numerous than Ubx2. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the relationship between lipid homeostasis and cell functions in the oil-producing organism P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical characterization of Aspergillus oryzae recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase protein revealed smeared bands with apparent molecular mass of 90-130 kDa. After N-deglycosylation, the recombinant enzyme showed a molecular mass of 70 kDa. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at a pH of 5.0 and a temperature of 70 degrees C. Specific activity of the enzyme was higher toward hesperidin than toward naringin, which consist of alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,2 linkages, respectively. The activity was also higher toward hesperidin than toward rutin, which consist of 7-O- and 3-O-glycosyl linkages of flavonoids, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme showed that the Michaelis constant (Km) was lowest toward rutin, moderate toward naringin, and higher toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside and hesperidin. Its high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward rutin was results of its low Km value while its high catalytic efficiency toward hesperidin was results of a considerably high kcat value.</p></details><hr><h4>The adaptive landscape of wildtype and glycosylation-deficient populations of the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. W. Moser, I. B. H. Wilson, M.

In this study we performed a large-scale laboratory evolution experiment with 48 populations of the yeast Pichia pastoris in order to establish a general adaptive landscape upon long-term selection in several glucose-based growth environments. As a model for a cellular malfunction the implications of OCH1 mannosyltransferase knockout-mediated glycosylation-deficiency were analyzed.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In-depth growth profiling of evolved populations revealed several instances of genotype-dependent growth trade-off/cross-benefit correlations in non-evolutionary growth conditions. On the genome level a high degree of mutational convergence was observed among independent populations. Environment-dependent mutational hotspots were related to osmotic stress-, Rim - and cAMP signaling pathways. In agreement with the observed growth phenotypes, our data also suggest diverging compensatory mutations in glycosylation-deficient populations. High osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway loss-of-functions mutations, including genes such as SSK2 and SSK4, represented a major adaptive strategy during environmental adaptation. However, genotype-specific HOG-related mutations were predominantly observed in opposing environmental conditions. Surprisingly, such mutations emerged during salt stress adaptation in OCH1 knockout populations and led to growth trade-offs in non-adaptive conditions that were distinct from wildtype HOG-mutants. Further environment-dependent mutations were identified for a hitherto uncharacterized species-specific Gal4-like transcriptional regulator involved in environmental sensing.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> We show that metabolic constraints such as glycosylation-deficiency can contribute to evolution on the molecular level, even in non-diverging growth environments. Our dataset suggests universal adaptive mechanisms involving cellular stress response and cAMP/PKA signaling but also the existence of highly species-specific strategies involving unique transcriptional regulators, improving our biological understanding of distinct Ascomycetes species.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of Functional Anti-Ebola Antibodies in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

Here, we propose an efficient development cycle using glycoengineered Pichia pastoris to produce monoclonal antibody cocktails against pathogens. To enable rapid genetic engineering of P. pastoris, we introduced a genomic landing pad for reliable recombinase-mediated DNA integration. We then created strains expressing each of the three monoclonal antibodies that comprise the ZMapp cocktail, and demonstrated that the secreted antibodies bind to the Ebola virus glycoprotein by immunofluorescence assay. We anticipate that this approach could accelerate the production of therapeutics against future pathogen outbreaks.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and characterization of a novel Colletotrichum graminicola raffinose oxidase in the AA5 family.</h4><p>M.

Despite the biotechnological potential of carbohydrate oxidases from family AA5, very few members have been characterized. The gene encoding raffinose oxidase activity from Colletotrichum graminicola, (Cg RaOx; EC 1.1.3.-) was identified utilizing a bioinformatics approach based on the known modular structure of a characterized AA5_2 galactose oxidase. Cg RaOx was expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified enzyme displayed the highest activity on the trisaccharide raffinose, whereas the activity on the disaccharide melibiose was three times lower and more than ten times lower activity was detected on D-galactose at 300 mM substrate concentration. Thus, the substrate preference of Cg RaOx distinguished clearly from the known galactose oxidases. The site of oxidation for raffinose was studied by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry, and confirmed that the hydroxyl group at the C6 position was oxidized to an aldehyde, and that in addition uronic acid was produced as a side product. A new ESI-MS method for the identification of C-6 oxidized products was developed and the formation mechanism of the uronic acid studied. Cg RaOx presented a novel activity pattern in the AA5 family.Importance Currently there are only a few characterized members of the CAZy AA5 protein family. These enzymes are interesting from an application point of view because of their ability to utilize the cheap and abundant oxidant O2 without the requirement ofcomplex cofactors such as FAD or NAD(P). Here we present the identification and characterization of a novel AA5 member from Colletotrichum graminicola As discussed in the paper, the bioinformatics approach using the modular structure of galactose oxidase was successful in finding a C6-OH carbohydrate oxidase having substrate preference for the trisaccharide raffinose. By the discovery of this activity, the diversity of the CAZy AA5 family is increasing.</p></details><hr><h4>An automated data-driven DSP development approach for glycoproteins from yeast.</h4><p>V.

In a previous study, we purified three recombinant glycoproteins from Pichia pastoris using a simple two-step flowthrough mode approach using monolithic columns. In this study, we investigated a novel automated data science approach for identifying purification conditions for such glycoproteins using monolithic columns. We performed three sets of design of experiments in analytical scale to determine the separation efficiency of monolithic columns for three different recombinant horseradish peroxidase (HRP) isoenzymes. For ease of calculation, we introduced an arbitrary term, the relative impurity removal (IR), which is representative of the amount of impurities cleared. Both, the experimental part and the data analysis were automated and took less than 40 min for each HRP isoenzyme. We tested the identified purification conditions in laboratory scale and performed respective offline analyses to verify results from analytical scale. We found a clear correlation between the IR estimated online through our novel data-driven approach and the IR determined offline. Summarizing, we present a novel methodology, applying analytical scale advantages which can be used for fast and efficient DSP development for recombinant glycoproteins from yeast without offline analyses.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of an anti-Abeta antibody fragment in Pichia pastoris and in vitro and in vivo validation of its therapeutic effect.</h4><p>L.

Because one of the major bottlenecks for the therapeutic uses of proteins produced in Escherichia coli is their potential contamination with endotoxins, LPS were extensively removed by a rather low-efficient, expensive, and time-consuming purification step. In addition, disulfide scrambling is favored in the reducing bacterial cytoplasm albeit the use of reductase deficient strains. To overcome these hurdles, as well as to improve the yield, the yeast Pichia pastoris, an endotoxin-free host system for recombinant protein production, has been used to produce scFv-h3D6, both in flask and in a fed-batch bioreactor. Comparison of the thermal stability of the obtained protein with that from E. coli showed no differences. Opposite to the case of the protein obtained from E. coli, no disulfide scrambled conformations or LPS traces were detected in that produced in P. pastoris. Cytotoxicity assays in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell-cultures demonstrated that proteins from both expression systems were similarly efficient in precluding Abeta-induced toxicity. Finally, the 3xTg-AD mouse model was used to test the therapeutic effect of both proteins. Quantification of Abeta levels from cortex and hippocampus protein extracts by ELISA, and Abeta-immunohistochemistry, showed that both proteins reduced Abeta burden. This work demonstrates that scFv-h3D6 obtained from P. pastoris shows the same benefits as those already known for that obtained from E. coli, with multiple advantages in terms of recombinant production and safety.</p></details><hr><h4>Two acidic, thermophilic GH28 polygalacturonases from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM 12802 with application potentials for grape juice clarification.</h4><p>Y.

Two novel polygalacturonases (exo-TePG28a and endo-TePG28b) were identified in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802, overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized in this report. The specific activities of TePG28a and TePG28b towards polygalacturonic acid were 280+/-9 and 25,900+/-502U/mg, respectively. Both enzymes exhibited optimal activities at pH 3.5 and retained highly stable over a broad pH range of 2.0-7.0. Distinct from most fungal polygalacturonases that have low temperature optima, TePG28a and TePG28b were optimally active at 70 degrees C. When treated the grape juice with the enzyme combination (the unit ratio of TePG28a:TePG28b was 1:4), higher pectin-degrading efficiency (up to 140%) was achieved, and light transmittance was improved from 14% to 82%. These favorable enzymatic properties make TePG28a and TePG28b attractive for the applications in the juice industry.</p></details><hr><h4>An improved process for the production of highly purified recombinant thaumatin tagged-variants.</h4><p>R.

Thaumatin is used in the food and beverage industry as a low-calorie sugar substitute. Thaumatin interacts with taste receptors in the oral cavity eliciting a persistent sweet taste and a bitter, liquorice flavor. Recombinant thaumatin was expressed in Pichia pastoris and through a co-expression strategy with a molecular chaperone, yields of one engineered thaumatin variant increased by greater than two-fold. A detailed purification strategy for thaumatin is reported resulting in a homogenous sample recovered at a yield of 42%. The recombinant thaumatins were extensively characterised using size exclusion chromatography for homogeneity, reversed-phase HPLC for purity (99%), peptide digest LC-MS/MS for sequence determination, and circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopies for conformational characterisation. These new thaumatin variants are amenable for bioconjugation, providing chemical biology tools for thaumatin:taste receptor interaction studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Co-expression of lipase isozymes for enhanced expression in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

The results showed that the Kex2-mediated co-expression of lipase isozymes could express Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) and Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) simultaneously, and GS-RMk-kTL displayed an average lipase activity of 306.91 U ml-1 , higher than GS-RML and GS-kTL (2.89 and 300.59 U ml-1 ) expressed independently in P. pastoris, and the sum of both (303.48 U ml-1 ), implying the potential of isozyme co-expression mediated by Kex2 in increasing the overall recombinant expression, but the low recombinant expression of RML in P. pastoris weakened the overall increasing effect on lipase expression in the isozyme co-expression strains. In addition, the fusion isozymes were successfully expressed, but with low lipase activities. Furthermore, 2A peptide could successfully mediate the co-expression and secretion of lipase isozymes, but it seriously affected the expression of TLL downstream of 2A peptide.</p><p><strong> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> The low production level is one of the limitation factors for decreasing the prices of enzymes and expanding their application in industry as the biocatalysts. This research focuses on developing lipase isozyme co-expression strategies in Pichia pastoris to enhance the expression level of overall lipase isozymes which catalyse the same reaction. The Kex2-mediated co-expression strategy of lipase isozymes could potentially enhance the overall isozyme expression, and isozyme co-expression might provide a new direction for improving the recombinant isozyme expression, and decreasing the production and application prices of these mixed enzymes as biocatalysts.</p></details><hr><h4>Co-expression of alpha-1 antitrypsin with cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE in Pichia pastoris: preserving biological activity of alpha-1 antitrypsin.</h4><p>M.

Because of its extensive application in medicine, recombinant DNA technology has been considered for its production. The current study is going to examine co-expression of A1AT, and soluble domain of v-SNARE in Pichia pastoris, which can prevent the secretion of A1AT after passing the secretory pathway thoroughly. This was done mainly to preserve the biological activity of A1AT which in the secretory mode might be impaired in the fermentation and early clarification conditions. SNARE proteins are the driving force for vesicle docking and membrane fusion in the term defined as exocytosis. Intracellular expression of the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE and its subsequent interaction to form SNARE complex can intensify the competition for A1AT secretory vesicles to be fused and released to the media. Our investigation shows successful co-expression of A1AT in the form of post-Golgi vesicles (PGVs), and the cytoplasmic domain of v-SNARE. Our findings confirmed the reduction of A1AT secretion by 45% which trapped in post-Golgi A1AT secretory vesicles inside the cell were biologically more active than secreted A1AT protein. These results indicate that the inhibition of A1AT secretion can protect its biological activity in fermentation and clarification processes. This article is protected by copyright.

They are important nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products that are biosynthesized through the action of chondroitin sulfotransferases on either an unsulfated chondroitin or a dermatan polysaccharide precursor. While the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfates are well known, the cloning end expression of these membrane-bound Golgi enzymes continue to pose challenges. The major chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase, Homo sapiens C4ST-1, had been previously cloned and expressed from mammalian CHO, COS-7, and HEK 293 cells, and its activity was shown to require glycosylation. In the current study, a C4ST-1 construct was designed and expressed in both Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris in its non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms. Both constructs showed similar activity albeit different kinetic parameters when acting on a microbially prepared unsulfated chondroitin substrate. Moreover, the glycosylated form of C4ST-1 showed lower stability than the non-glycosylated form.</p></details><hr><h4>Towards systems metabolic engineering in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. P.

Already, a sizeable amount of systems biology knowledge has been acquired for this non-conventional yeast. By applying various omics-technologies, productivity features have been thoroughly analyzed and optimized via genetic engineering. However, challenging clonal variability, limited vector repertoire and insufficient genome annotation have hampered further developments. Yet, in the last few years a reinvigorated effort to establish P. pastoris as a host for both protein and metabolite production is visible. A variety of compounds from terpenoids to polyketides have been synthesized, often exceeding the productivity of other microbial systems. The clonal variability was systematically investigated and strategies formulated to circumvent untargeted events, thereby streamlining the screening procedure. Promoters with novel regulatory properties were discovered or engineered from existing ones. The genetic tractability was increased via the transfer of popular manipulation and assembly techniques, as well as the creation of new ones. A second generation of sequencing projects culminated in the creation of the second best functionally annotated yeast genome. In combination with landmark physiological insights and increased output of omics-data, a good basis for the creation of refined genome-scale metabolic models was created. The first application of model-based metabolic engineering in P. pastoris showcased the potential of this approach. Recent efforts to establish yeast peroxisomes for compartmentalized metabolite synthesis appear to fit ideally with the well-studied high capacity peroxisomal machinery of P. pastoris. Here, these recent developments are collected and reviewed with the aim of supporting the establishment of systems metabolic engineering in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of the antimyotoxic protein DM64 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

Interestingly, some animals are resistant to snake envenomation due to the presence of inhibitory glycoproteins in their serum that target toxic venom components. DM64 is an acidic glycoprotein isolated from Didelphis aurita (opossum) serum that has been characterized as an inhibitor of the myotoxicity induced by bothropic toxins bearing phospholipase A2 (PLA2) structures. This antitoxic protein can serve as an excellent starting template for the design of novel therapeutics against snakebite envenomation, particularly venom-induced local tissue damage. Therefore, the aim of this work was to produce a recombinant DM64 (rDM64) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and to compare its biological properties with those of native DM64. Yeast fermentation in the presence of Pefabloc, a serine protease inhibitor, stimulated cell growth (~1.5-fold), increased the rDM64 production yield approximately 10-fold and significantly reduced the susceptibility of rDM64 to proteolytic degradation. P. pastoris fermentation products were identified by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. The heterologous protein was efficiently purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography (with immobilized PLA2 myotoxin) and/or an ion exchange column. Although both native and recombinant DM64 exhibit different glycosylation patterns, they show very similar electrophoretic mobilities after PNGase F treatment. rDM64 formed a noncovalent complex with myotoxin II (Lys49-PLA2) from Bothrops asper and displayed biological activity that was similar to that of native DM64, inhibiting the cytotoxicity of myotoxin II by 92% at a 1:1 molar ratio.</p></details><hr><h4>High level expression of beta-mannanase (RmMan5A) in Pichia pastoris for partially hydrolyzed guar gum production.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, a novel beta-mannanase gene (RmMan5A) from Rhizomucor miehei was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and subjected for PHGG production. Enzyme activity of fermentation supernatant reached 85,200UmL-1 after 168h high cell density fermentation. The purified RmMan5A exhibited the highest enzyme activity at pH 7.0 and 65 degrees C. RmMan5A was then employed for guar gum hydrolysis and PHGG obtained demonstrated a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 2.5x104Da. Total dietary fiber accounted 90.6% of PHGG and 24.9% (w/w) of PHGG were identified as manno-oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization<7. PHGG was further fractionated (F1-F4) by gradual ethanol precipitation. PHGG F1 with an Mw value of 3.6x104Da and a mannose/galactose (M/G) ratio of 1.47 was precipitated initially, followed by PHGG F2 and F3 which showed lower Mw and higher M/G ratio. According to the structure analysis, the distribution of alpha-d-galactose of PHGG F1 was compact and regular, and that of other fractions was more random. A suitable beta-mannanase for PHGG production and some useful information of PHGG are provided in this paper.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering of Yersinia Phytases to Improve Pepsin and Trypsin Resistance and Thermostability and Application Potential in the Food and Feed Industry.</h4><p>C.

We sought to improve the pepsin and trypsin resistance of YeAPPA from Yersinia enterocolitica and YkAPPA from Y. kristensenii by optimizing amino acid polarity and charge. The predicted pepsin/trypsin cleavage sites F89/K226 in pepsin/trypsin-sensitive YeAPPA and the corresponding sites (F89/E226) in pepsin-sensitive but trypsin-resistant YkAPPA were substituted with S and H, respectively. Six variants were produced in Pichia pastoris for catalytic and biochemical characterization. F89S, E226H, and F89S/E226H elevated pepsin resistance and thermostability and K226H and F89S/K226H improved pepsin and trypsin resistance and stability at 60 degrees C and low pH. All the variants increased the ability of the proteins to hydrolyze phytate in corn meal by 2.6-14.9-fold in the presence of pepsin at 37 degrees C and low pH. This study developed a genetic manipulation strategy specific for pepsin/trypsin-sensitive phytases that can improve enzyme tolerance against proteases and heat and benefit the food and feed industry in a cost-effective way.</p></details><hr><h4>A step forward in laccase exploitation: Recombinant production and evaluation of techno-economic feasibility of the process.</h4><p>C.

The high redox potential laccase POXA1b from Pleurotus ostreatus was chosen as case study of marketable enzyme, due to its desirable properties in terms of activity/stability profile, and already assessed applicability. POXA1b was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris by investigating the effect of inducible and constitutive expression systems on both the yield and the cost of its production. System performances were first assessed in shaken-flasks and then scaled-up in bioreactor. The production level obtained in the inducible system is 42U/mL, while the activity value achieved with the constitutive one is 60U/mL, the highest obtained in constitutive systems so far. The economic feasibility of recombinant laccase production was simulated, describing the case of an Italian small-medium enterprise. Two scenarios were evaluated: Scenario (I) production based on methanol inducible system; Scenario (II) production based on the constitutive system, fed with glycerol. At all the scales the glycerol-based fermentation is more economic than the methanol-based one.

Cartwright et al., BMC Res Notes 10 340 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28750657>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Patients with dual hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis D (HDV) virus infection are at an increased risk of progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma than patients with a single viral infection. Treatment of viral hepatitis due to dual HBV/HDV infection represents a challenge. Currently there is no vaccine against HDV. Recombinant production of HDV antigen (HDAg) is the first step towards a potential vaccine candidate and the development of assays for HDV detection.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> This study demonstrates the expression of one HDAg isoform, S-HDAg, in Pichia pastoris. A recombinant vector carrying a tagged gene encoding S-HDAg under the control of the methanol-inducible promoter AOX1 was designed and integrated into P. pastoris X33. The protein, which was purified using a Ni2+ affinity column and eluted at 100-150 mM imidazole, has potential as a recombinant antigen for further study.</p></details><hr><h4>Compact Cell Settlers for Perfusion Cultures of Microbial (and Mammalian) Cells.</h4><p>C. A. Freeman, P. S. D. Samuel, D. S. Kompala, Biotechnol Prog 33 913 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28748636>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As microbial secretory expression systems have become well developed for microbial yeast cells, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, it is advantageous to develop high cell density continuous perfusion cultures of microbial yeast cells to retain the live and productive yeast cells inside the perfusion bioreactor while removing the dead cells and cell debris along with the secreted product protein in the harvest stream. While the previously demonstrated inclined or lamellar settlers can be used for such perfusion bioreactors for microbial cells, the size and footprint requirements of such inefficiently scaled up devices can be quite large in comparison to the bioreactor size. Faced with this constraint, we have now developed novel, patent-pending compact cell settlers that can be used more efficiently with microbial perfusion bioreactors to achieve high cell densities and bioreactor productivities. Reproducible results from numerous month-long perfusion culture experiments using these devices attached to the 5 L perfusion bioreactor demonstrate very high cell densities due to substantial sedimentation of the larger live yeast cells which are returned to the bioreactor, while the harvest stream from the top of these cell settlers is a significantly clarified liquid, containing less than 30% and more typically less than 10% of the bioreactor cell concentration. Size of cells in the harvest is smaller than that of the cells in the bioreactor. Accumulated protein collected from the harvest and rate of protein accumulation is significantly (> 6x) higher than the protein produced in repeated fed-batch cultures over the same culture duration.

Wang et al., J Biosci Bioeng   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28743658>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, the coding sequence of the lipase from Proteus sp. SW1 was optimized via codon optimization and subjected to expression in Pichia pastoris GS115. The maximum enzyme yield was 387 mg/L in the supernatants of the shake-flask culture. The purified recombinant lipase exhibited a specific activity of 130 U/mg toward p-nitrophenyl Laurate. Its optimum pH and temperature were 8.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. It was highly stable and even activated in water-miscible solvents, showing over 102% residual activity after 24 h incubation in ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and acetonitrile. In addition, the enzyme showed promoted activity with the increasing concentrations of methanol/ethanol and exhibited the maximum activity at 80%. In a solvent-free system for biodiesel synthesis with a one-step addition of methanol, the recombinant lipase displayed a 87% conversion rate toward palm oil at the high water content of 80%. The highly improved expression level and activity of the recombinant lipase may contribute to enable its commercial-scale production, and the unique properties would make it a particularly promising biocatalyst for biodiesel production in the future.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the hepcidin gene from roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus).</h4><p>Y. Liu et al., Fish Shellfish Immunol 68 349 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28743631>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hepcidin is a kind of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptide that plays a vital role in host innate immune activity and iron regulation. Here, we report the molecular characterization and functional analysis of a novel hamp1 hepcidin isoforms Tf-Hep from roughskin sculpin, Trachidermus fasciatus. A cDNA fragment of 988 bp with an ORF of 273 bp was obtained. The coding sequence encodes for a signal peptide of 24 amino acids coupled with a prodomain of 40 amino acids and a mature peptide of 26 amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that Tf-Hep was most abundant in the liver. It could be significantly induced post lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and heavy metal exposure. The mature peptide was expressed as a 6.061 kDa fusion protein in Pichia pastoris GS115. The active purified recombinant protein (rTf-Hep) exhibited a wide spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity in vitro against 4 Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio Anguillarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus megaterium with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-80 mug/ml (0.825-13.2 muM). It also displayed high affinity to polysaccharides on bacteria surface including LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN). We further revealed that rTf-hep was capable of agglutinating 6 of the 8 bacteria. All these results suggest that rTf-hep may be both an antibacterial effector and a pattern recognition molecule in fish immune defense. The in vivo bacterial treatment results demonstrated that rTf-Hep could significantly improve the survival rate of fish infected with V. anguillarum. Taken together, these data indicate an important role for Tf-hep in the innate immunity of Trachidermus fasciatus and suggest its potential application in aquaculture for increasing fish resistance to disease.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel cystatin type 2 from Rhipicephalus microplus midgut.</h4><p>T. H. S. Cardoso et al., Biochimie 140 117 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28735872>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is an exclusive bovine ectoparasite responsible for the transmission of pathogens that decrease meat, leather and milk productions. Cattle vaccination is an alternative to control tick infestations, but the discovery of potential antigens is still a challenge for researchers. Recently, our group performed a midgut transcriptome of engorged R. microplus tick, and out of 800 ESTs sequences one cystatin-coding sequence was identified and named Rmcystatin-4. In order to understand the physiological role of Rmcystatin-4, the aim of this work was the expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel type 2 cystatin from the tick R. microplus. Rmcystatin-4 gene expression was identified mostly in tick midgut suggesting its possible role in blood digestion control. Our data showed that rRmcystatin-4 was successfully expressed in active form using Pichia pastoris system and the purified inhibitor presented high selectivity to BmCl-1 (Ki = 0.046 nM). Moreover, rRmcystatin-4 was able to impaired BmCl-1 activity towards bovine hemoglobin.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Bacillus amyloliquefaciens xylanase A expressed in Pichia pastoris and generation of xylooligosaccharides from xylans and wheat bran.</h4><p>M. Q. Liu, W. K. Huo, X. Xu, X. Y. Weng, Int J Biol Macromol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732724>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, BaxA (GenBank: KM624029), which encodes the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens xylanase A (BaxA), was highly expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 under the control of the AOX1 promoter. The recombinant xylanase, namely rePBaxA, was purified to homogeneity by using Ni-affinity resin and its molecular weight was 35.0kDa. The optimum temperature and pH of rePBaxA were 50 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The kinetic parameters Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of rePBaxA were 5.41mg/mL and 22.42mumol/min/mL, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography results showed that after 6h of hydrolysis, rePBaxA released xylose-xylohexaose (X1-X6) mixture from beechwood and birchwood xylan, with xylobiose (X2) and xylotriose (X3) as the major products, respectively. The hydrolyates from oat spelt, wheat bran insoluble xylan and pretreated wheat bran by rePBaxA included X2-X6, with X6 having the highest concentration. The mode of action analysis revealed that rePBaxA was an endo-acting xylanase with transglycosylation activity. X2 might be the minimum oligomer hydrolyzed by rePBaxA. The pretreated wheat bran and wheat bran insoluble xylan could be directly hydrolyzed by rePBaxA. This study provided a basis for using agricultural waste by-products as substrates for manufacting value-added probiotics, namely, xylooligosaccharides.</p></details>
