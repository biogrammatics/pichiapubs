Marsalek et al., Biotechnol J   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230321>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella spp.) is a popular microbial host for the production of recombinant proteins. Previous studies have shown that mis-sorting to the vacuole can be a bottleneck during production of recombinant secretory proteins in yeast, however, no information was available for P. pastoris. In this work we have therefore generated vps (vacuolar protein sorting) mutant strains disrupted in genes involved in the CORVET tethering complex at the early stages of endosomal sorting. Both Deltavps8 and Deltavps21 strains contained lower extracellular amounts of heterologous carboxylesterase (CES) compared to the control strain, which could be attributed to a high proteolytic activity present in the supernatants of CORVET engineered strains due to rerouting of vacuolar proteases. Serine proteases were identified to be responsible for this proteolytic degradation by LC-MS and protease inhibitor assays. Deletion of the major cellular serine protease Prb1 in Deltavps8 and Deltavps21 strains did not only rescue the extracellular CES levels, but even outperformed the parental CES strain (56% and 80% higher yields, respectively). Further deletion of Ybr139W, another serine protease, did not show further increase in secretion levels. Higher extracellular CES activity and low proteolytic activity were detected also in fed batch cultivation of Deltavps21Deltaprb1 strains, thus confirming that modifying early steps in the vacuolar pathway has a positive impact on heterologous protein secretion.</p></details><hr><h4>Design and pharmacodynamics of recombinant NZ2114 histidine mutants with improved activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</h4><p>H. Chen et al., AMB Express 7 46 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229435>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>NZ2114 is a promising candidate for therapeutic application owing to its potent activity to Staphylococcus aureus. Our objective was to identify NZ2114 derivatives with improved activity through substitution of His16 and His18 with residues Arginine and Lysine. Eight mutants were designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 via pPICZalphaA. Five of them exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus at low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.057-0.454 muM. Among them, H1, H2, and H3 showed ideal pharmacodynamic effects on methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300. The total protein level of H1, H2, and H3 reached 1.70, 1.77 and 1.54 g/l at 120 h of induction in the 5-l fermenter, respectively. They killed over 99.9% of pathogens within 1.5 h at 2x and 4x MIC. The post antibiotic effect of H1, H2 and H3 to S. aureus ATCC43300 was 2.94, 1.75 and 1.55 h at 2x MIC, which was similar with their original peptide NZ2114 (1.43 h) and vancomycin (1.72 h). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated indifferent effects between H1, H2, H3 and vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampicin. Additionally, they had low hemolysis and high stability in different environments (temperature, pH, proteases, and saline ions). All results indicate that H1, H2, and H3 can be produced in large-scale and have potential as therapeutic drugs against MRSA.</p></details><hr><h4>AoS28D, a proline-Xaa carboxypeptidase secreted by Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>K. Salamin et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229206>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Prolyl peptidases of the MEROPS S28 family are of particular interest because they are key enzymes in the digestion of proline-rich peptides. A BLAST analysis of the Aspergillus oryzae genome revealed sequences coding for four proteases of the S28 family. Three of these proteases, AoS28A, AoS28B, and AoS28C, were previously characterized as acidic prolyl endopeptidases. The fourth protease, AoS28D, showed high sequence divergence with other S28 proteases and belongs to a phylogenetically distinct cluster together with orthologous proteases from other Aspergillus species. The objective of the present paper was to characterize AoS28D protease in terms of substrate specificity and activity. AoS28D produced by gene overexpression in A. oryzae and in Pichia pastoris was a 70-kDa glycoprotein with a 10-kDa sugar moiety. In contrast with other S28 proteases, AoS28D did not hydrolyze internal Pro-Xaa bonds of several tested peptides. Similarly, to human lysosomal Pro-Xaa carboxypeptidase, AoS28D demonstrated selectivity for cleaving C-terminal Pro-Xaa bonds which are resistant to carboxypeptidases of the S10 family concomitantly secreted by A. oryzae. Therefore, AoS28D could act in synergy with these enzymes during sequential degradation of a peptide from its C-terminus.</p></details><hr><h4>Dynamic genome-scale metabolic modeling of the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>F. Saitua, P. Torres, J. R. Perez-Correa, E. Agosin, BMC Syst Biol 11 27 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28222737>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Pichia pastoris shows physiological advantages in producing recombinant proteins, compared to other commonly used cell factories. This yeast is mostly grown in dynamic cultivation systems, where the cell's environment is continuously changing and many variables influence process productivity. In this context, a model capable of explaining and predicting cell behavior for the rational design of bioprocesses is highly desirable. Currently, there are five genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of P. pastoris which have been used to predict extracellular cell behavior in stationary conditions.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this work, we assembled a dynamic genome-scale metabolic model for glucose-limited, aerobic cultivations of Pichia pastoris. Starting from an initial model structure for batch and fed-batch cultures, we performed pre/post regression diagnostics to ensure that model parameters were identifiable, significant and sensitive. Once identified, the non-relevant ones were iteratively fixed until a priori robust modeling structures were found for each type of cultivation. Next, the robustness of these reduced structures was confirmed by calibrating the model with new datasets, where no sensitivity, identifiability or significance problems appeared in their parameters. Afterwards, the model was validated for the prediction of batch and fed-batch dynamics in the studied conditions. Lastly, the model was employed as a case study to analyze the metabolic flux distribution of a fed-batch culture and to unravel genetic and process engineering strategies to improve the production of recombinant Human Serum Albumin (HSA). Simulation of single knock-outs indicated that deviation of carbon towards cysteine and tryptophan formation improves HSA production. The deletion of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase could increase the HSA volumetric productivity by 630%. Moreover, given specific bioprocess limitations and strain characteristics, the model suggests that implementation of a decreasing specific growth rate during the feed phase of a fed-batch culture results in a 25% increase of the volumetric productivity of the protein.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> In this work, we formulated a dynamic genome scale metabolic model of Pichia pastoris that yields realistic metabolic flux distributions throughout dynamic cultivations. The model can be calibrated with experimental data to rationally propose genetic and process engineering strategies to improve the performance of a P. pastoris strain of interest.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of rabies virus glycoprotein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

Different approaches were investigated to develop novel human rabies vaccines with improved features compared to the current available vaccines, among them is the use of heterologous gene expression technology. Here, we describe the expression of the surface rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), which is the major antigen responsible for the induction of protective immunity, in Pichia pastoris. Six transformants were selected according to their gene copy number as determined by real time qPCR. Upon induction by methanol, low level of RABV-G was secreted into the culture medium, around 60 ng/mL. To understand the effect of foreign gene dosage on cellular physiology of P. pastoris, transcriptional analysis of key genes involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway was performed. Results showed that these pathways were highly activated; misfolded RABV-G was degraded in the cytosol via the ERAD mechanism. To study the functionality of the secreted RABV-G, in vitro competitive neutralizing assay was conducted. Data showed the secreted recombinant RABV-G had enabled a reduction of the neutralizing activity of human immune rabies serum, indicating that the secreted recombinant protein had reached its correct conformational form.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Aspergillus aculeatus endo-polygalacturonase in Pichia pastoris by high cell density fermentation and its application in textile scouring.</h4><p>D.

In this study, an endo-polygalacturonase (EndoPG) from Aspergillus aculeatus produced in Pichia pastoris was evaluated for its efficiency as a bioscouring agent while most current bioscouring process has been performed using crude pectinase preparation.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The recombinant EndoPG exhibited a specific activity of 1892.08 U/mg on citrus pectin under the optimal condition at 50 degrees C, pH 5.0 with a V max and K m of 65,451.35 mumol/min/mL and 15.14 mg/mL, respectively. A maximal activity of 2408.70 +/- 26.50 U/mL in the culture supernatant was obtained by high cell density batch fermentation, equivalent to a 4.8 times greater yield than that from shake-flask culture. The recombinant enzyme was shown to be suitable for application as a bioscouring agent, in which the wettability of cotton fabric was increased by treatment with enzyme at 300 U/mL scouring solution at 40 degrees C, pH 5.0 for 1 h. The bio-scoured fabric has comparable wettability to that obtained by conventional chemical scouring, but has higher tensile strength.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The work has demonstrated for the first time functions of A. aculeatus EndoPG on bioscouring in eco-textile processing. EndoPG alone was shown to possess effective scouring activity. High expression level and homogeneity could be achieved in bench-scale bioreactor.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretion of functional formate dehydrogenase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Takacs, O. V.

In this study, the CYP6B7 gene from H. armigera (namely HaCYP6B7), was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. A vector pPICZA-HaCYP6B7 was constructed and transformed into P. pastoris GS115, the transformant of pPICZA-HaCYP6B7-GS115 was then cultured and induced by 1% (v/v) methanol and the heterologous expression of HaCYP6B7 protein in P. pastoris was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Microsomes containing the expressed HaCYP6B7 showed activities against model substrate p-nitroanisole and 7-ethoxycoumarin, with p-nitroanisole O-demethylation (PNOD) and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD) activities of 15.66 and 4.75-fold of the control, respectively. Moreover, it showed degradation activities against insecticides bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos, with clearance activities of 6.88, 1.49 and 2.27-fold of the control respectively. The interactions of HaCYP6B7 with insecticides were further confirmed by molecular docking in silico with binding scores of 5.450, 5.295 and 2.197 between putative HaCYP6B7 protein and bifenthrin, fenvalerate and chlorpyrifos, respectively.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The results of present study provided more direct and important evidence on the role of HaCYP6B7 conferring pyrethroid resistance in H. armigera.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization and crystal structure of a thermostable glycoside hydrolase family 45 1,4-beta-endoglucanase from Thielavia terrestris.</h4><p>J. Gao et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 99 32 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193329>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>1,4-beta-Endoglucanase is one of the most important biocatalysts in modern industries. Here, a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 45 endoglucanase from thermophilic fungus Theilavia terrestris (TtCel45A) was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein shows optimal activity at 60 degrees C, pH 4-5. The enzyme exhibits extraordinary thermostability that more than 80% activity was detected after heating at 80 degrees C for 2.5h. The high resolution crystal structures of apo-form enzyme and that in complex with cellobiose and cellotetraose were solved to 1.36-1.58A. The protein folds into two overall regions: one is a six-stranded beta-barrel, and the other one consists of several extended loops. Between the two regions lies the substrate-binding channel, which is an open cleft spanning across the protein surface. A continuous substrate-binding cleft from subsite -4 to +3 were clearly identified in the complex structures. Notably, the flexible V-VI loop (113Gly-114Gly-115Asp-116Leu-117Gly-118Ser) is found to open in the presence of -1 sugar, with D115 and L116 swung away to yield a space to accommodate the catalytic acid D122 and the 2,5B boat conformation of -1 sugar during transition state. Collectively, we characterized the enzyme properties of P. pastoris-expressed TtCel45A and solved high-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme. These results are of great interests in industrial applications and provide new insights into the fundamental understanding of enzyme catalytic mechanism of GH45 endoglucanases.</p></details><hr><h4>A high-throughput expression screening platform to optimize the production of antimicrobial peptides.</h4><p>C. Schreiber et al., Microb Cell Fact 16 29 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193216>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates for the development of novel antibiotics, but it is difficult to produce sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical studies due to their toxicity towards microbial expression hosts. To avoid laborious trial-and-error testing for the identification of suitable expression constructs, we have developed a small-scale expression screening platform based on a combinatorial plasmid library.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The combinatorial library is based on the Golden Gate cloning system. In each reaction, six donor plasmids (each containing one component: a promoter, fusion partner 1, fusion partner 2, protease cleavage site, gene of interest, or transcriptional terminator) were combined with one acceptor plasmid to yield the final expression construct. As a proof of concept, screening was carried out in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris to study the expression of three different model AMPs with challenging characteristics, such as host toxicity or multiple disulfide bonds. The corresponding genes were successfully cloned in 27 E. coli and 18 P. pastoris expression plasmids, each in a one-step Golden Gate reaction. After transformation, small-scale expression screening in microtiter plates was followed by AMP quantification using a His6 tag-specific ELISA. Depending on the plasmid features and the expression host, the protein yields differed by more than an order of magnitude. This allowed the identification of high producers suitable for larger-scale protein expression.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The optimization of recombinant protein production is best achieved from first principles by initially optimizing the genetic construct. The unrestricted combination of multiple plasmid features yields a comprehensive library of expression strains that can be screened for optimal productivity. The availability of such a platform could benefit all laboratories working in the field of recombinant protein expression.</p></details><hr><h4>An effective and simplified DO-stat control strategy for production of rabies glycoprotein in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L. D.

In the present study, the G-protein gene of rabies virus CVS strain was cloned, sequenced and expressed in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, as a secreted protein, using a simplified DO-stat control feeding strategy. This strategy involves the addition of methanol when the dissolved oxygen (DO) level rises above the setpoint avoiding methanol accumulation and oxygen limitation. The G-protein expression was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, and western blot assays. Like native G-protein, the recombinant G-protein was found reactive when it was challenged against specific antibodies. The data indicate that the recombinant G-protein can be easily expressed and isolated, and may be useful as a safe source in the production of diagnostic kits and subunit vaccines to prevent rabies.</p></details><hr><h4>Role of N-linked glycosylation in the enzymatic properties of a thermophilic GH 10 xylanase from Aspergillus fumigatus expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X. Chang et al., PLoS One 12 e0171111 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187141>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>N-Glycosylation is a posttranslational modification commonly occurred in fungi and plays roles in a variety of enzyme functions. In this study, a xylanase (Af-XYNA) of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 from Aspergillus fumigatus harboring three potential N-glycosylation sites (N87, N124 and N335) was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. The N-glycosylated Af-XYNA (WT) exhibited favorable temperature and pH optima (75 degrees C and pH 5.0) and good thermostability (maintaining stable at 60 degrees C). To reveal the role of N-glycosylation on Af-XYNA, the enzyme was deglycosylated by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (DE) or modified by site-directed mutagenesis at N124 (N124T). The deglycosylated DE and mutant N124T showed narrower pH adaptation range, lower specific activity, and worse pH and thermal stability. Further thermodynamic analysis revealed that the enzyme with higher N-glycosylation degree was more thermostable. This study demonstrated that the effects of glycosylation at different degrees and sites were diverse, in which the glycan linked to N124 played a key role in pH and thermal stability of Af-XYNA.</p></details><hr><h4>Crystallization of a fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase expressed from glycoengineered Pichia pastoris for X-ray and neutron diffraction.</h4><p>W. B. O'Dell, P. D. Swartz, K. L. Weiss, F.

Fungal LPMOs typically act on cellulose and can enhance the efficiency of cellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes that release soluble sugars for bioethanol production or other industrial uses. The enzyme PMO-2 from Neurospora crassa (NcPMO-2) was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris to facilitate crystallographic studies of the fungal LPMO mechanism. Diffraction resolution and crystal morphology were improved by expressing NcPMO-2 from a glycoengineered strain of P. pastoris and by the use of crystal seeding methods, respectively. These improvements resulted in high-resolution (1.20 A) X-ray diffraction data collection at 100 K and the production of a large NcPMO-2 crystal suitable for room-temperature neutron diffraction data collection to 2.12 A resolution.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of the wild type and truncated form of a neutral GH10 xylanase from Coprinus cinereus: Roles of C-terminal basic amino acid-rich extension in its SDS resistance, thermostability and activity.</h4><p>H. Hu et al., J Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28173691>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A neutral xylanase (Ccxyn) was identified from Coprinus cinereus. It has a single GH10 catalytic domain with a basic amino acid-rich extension (PVRRK) at C-terminus. In this study, the wild-type (Ccxyn) and C-terminus truncated xylanase (CcXynDelta5C) were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and their characteristics were comparatively analyzed with aims to examine the effect of this extension on the enzyme function. The circular dichorism (CD) analysis indicated that both enzymes in general had a similar structure, but CcXynDelta5C contained less alpha-helices (42.9%) and more random coil contents (35.5%) than CcXyn (47.0% and 32.8%, respectively). Both enzymes had same pH (7.0) and temperature (45 degrees C) optima, and similar substrate specificity on different xylans. They all hydrolyzed beechwood xylan primarily to xylobiose and xylotriose. The amounts of xylobiose and xylotriose account for 91.5% and 92.2 % (w/w) of total xylooligosaccharides (XOS) generated from beechwood by Ccxyn and CcxynDelta5C, respectively. However, truncation of C-terminal 5-amino acids extension significantly improves its thermostability, SDS resistance and pH stability at pH 6.0-9.0. Furthermore, CcxynDelta5C exhibited much lower Km value than Ccxyn (0.27 mg ml(-)(1) vs 0.83 mg ml(-)(1)), therefore, the catalytic efficiency of CcXynDelta5C was 2.4 times higher than that of CcXyn. These properties make CcxynDelta5C a good model for the structure-function study of (alpha/beta)(8)-barrel folded enzyme and a promising candidate for various applications, especially in the detergent industry and XOS production.</p></details><hr><h4>Acute and repeated dose (28 days) toxicity studies in rats and dogs of recombinant batroxobin, a snake venom thrombin-like enzyme expressed from Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>O.

To evaluate its toxicological effect, it was highly expressed in Pichia pastorisand successfully purified to homogeneity from culture broth supernatant following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The maximum tolerated dose of the recombinant batroxobin was examined in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and Beagle dogs following Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. The approximate lethal dose of recombinant batroxobin was 10 National Institute of Health (NIH) u/kg in male and female rats. Slight test substance-related effects were clearly in male and female dogs at more than 10 NIH u/kg. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was considered to be greater than 30 NIH u/kg in dogs. To investigate the repeated dose toxicity of batroxobin, the test item was intravenously administered to groups of SD rat and Beagle dog every day for 4 weeks. We observed that all animals survived the duration of the study without any effects on their mortality. There were no effects in both rats and dogs regarding their clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmological examination, urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weightand gross post mortem examinations. The no adverse effect level (NOAEL) of recombinant batroxobin for both males and females is considered to be greater than 2.5 NIH u/kgin rats and 1 NIH u/kg in dogs, respectively. No toxic effects were noted in target organs. In conclusion, these results show a favorable preclinical profile and may contribute clinical development of recombinant batroxobin.</p></details><hr><h4>Rapid screening of cellular stress responses in recombinant Pichia pastoris strains using metabolite profiling.</h4><p>G.

Recombinant enzyme production on the 5-L bioreactor scale (Rsp</p><p><strong>CAE:</strong> 3245UL-1) exceeded the productivity of the wild type strain by a factor of 800. Based on substrate specificity profiling, the purified recombinant RspCAE was classified as a p-coumaroyl esterase (pCAE) with a pronounced chlorogenic acid esterase side activity. The RspCAE was also active on methyl cinnamate, caffeate and ferulate and on feruloylated saccharides. The unprecedented substrate profile of RspCAE together with the lack of sequence similarity to known FAEs or pCAEs suggested that the RspCAE represents a new type of enzyme. Hydroxycinnamic acids were released from agro-industrial side-streams, such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB), sugar beet pectin (SBP) and coffee pulp (CP). Overnight incubation of coffee pulp with the RspCAE resulted in the efficient release of p-coumaric (100%), caffeic (100%) and ferulic acid (85%) indicating possible applications for the valorization of food processing wastes and for the enhanced degradation of lignified biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>A prime/boost vaccination with HA DNA and Pichia-produced HA protein elicits a strong humoral response in chickens against H5N1.</h4><p>A.

The main goal of this work was to evaluate the immune responses and hemagglutination inhibition potential elicited by a combined DNA/recombinant protein prime/boost vaccination compared to DNA/DNA and protein/protein regimens in chickens. A plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA) from the A/swan/Poland/305-135V08/2006 (H5N1) virus, or the recombinant HA protein produced in Pichia pastoris system, both induced H5 HA-specific humoral immune responses in chickens. In two independent experiments, anti-HA antibodies were detected in sera collected two weeks after the first dose and the response was enhanced by the second dose of a vaccine, regardless of the type of subunit vaccine (DNA or recombinant protein) administered. The serum collected from chickens two weeks after the second dose was characterized by three types of assays: indirect ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and a diagnostic test based on H5 antibody competition. Although the indirect ELISA failed to detect superiority of any of the three vaccine regimens, the other two tests clearly indicated that priming of chickens with the DNA vaccine significantly enhanced the protective potential of the recombinant protein vaccine produced in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Production in Pichia pastoris, antifungal activity and crystal structure of a class I chitinase from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata): Insights into sugar binding mode and hydrolytic action.</h4><p>P. G. Landim et al., Biochimie   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153694>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A cowpea class I chitinase (VuChiI) was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. The recombinant protein was secreted into the culture medium and purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin matrix. The purified chitinase migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two closely-related bands with apparent molecular masses of 34 and 37 kDa. The identity of these bands as VuChiI was demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The recombinant chitinase was able to hydrolyze colloidal chitin but did not exhibit enzymatic activity toward synthetic substrates. The highest hydrolytic activity of the cowpea chitinase toward colloidal chitin was observed at pH 5.0. Furthermore, most VuChiI activity (approximately 92%) was retained after heating to 50 degrees C for 30 min, whereas treatment with 5 mM Cu2+ caused a reduction of 67% in the enzyme's chitinolytic activity. The recombinant protein had antifungal activity as revealed by its ability to inhibit the spore germination and mycelial growth of Penicillium herquei. The three-dimensional structure of VuChiI was resolved at a resolution of 1.55 A by molecular replacement. The refined model had 245 amino acid residues and 381 water molecules, and the final R-factor and Rfree values were 14.78 and 17.22%, respectively. The catalytic domain of VuChiI adopts an alpha-helix-rich fold, stabilized by 3 disulfide bridges and possessing a wide catalytic cleft. Analysis of the crystallographic model and molecular docking calculations using chito-oligosaccharides provided evidences about the VuChiI residues involved in sugar binding and catalysis, and a possible mechanism of antifungal action is suggested.</p></details><hr><h4>Methanol-Independent Protein Expression by AOX1 Promoter with trans-Acting Elements Engineering and Glucose-Glycerol-Shift Induction in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J. Wang et al., Sci Rep 7 41850 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150747>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1) of Pichia pastoris is commonly used for high level expression of recombinant proteins. While the safety risk of methanol and tough process control for methanol induction usually cause problems especially in large-scale fermentation. By testing the functions of trans-acting elements of PAOX1 and combinatorially engineering of them, we successfully constructed a methanol-free PAOX1 start-up strain, in which, three transcription repressors were identified and deleted and, one transcription activator were overexpressed. The strain expressed 77% GFP levels in glycerol compared to the wide-type in methanol. Then, insulin precursor (IP) was expressed, taking which as a model, we developed a novel glucose-glycerol-shift induced PAOX1 start-up for this methanol-free strain. A batch phase with glucose of 40 g/L followed by controlling residual glucose not lower than 20 g/L was compatible for supporting cell growth and suppressing PAOX1. Then, glycerol induction was started after glucose used up. Accordingly, an optimal bioprocess was further determined, generating a high IP production of 2.46 g/L in a 5-L bioreactor with dramatical decrease of oxygen consumption and heat evolution comparing with the wild-type in methanol. This mutant and bioprocess represent a safe and efficient alternative to the traditional glycerol-repressed/methanol-induced PAOX1 system.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory Expression and Characterization of Chinese Narcissus GNA-Like Lectin in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X.

In the present paper, the codon-optimized ntl gene was transformed into the yeast Pichia pastoris; SDS-PAGE gel and western blotting analysis revealed that the recombinant lectin was expressed successfully in Pichia yeast. The similarity between the recombinant NTL and the native NTL was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and hemagglutination assay further. In the 5-L scale fermentator, the protein yield was as high as 1.2 g/L after fermentation for 96 h. In addition, the effect of metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cu2+), acid, and alkaline on hemagglutinating activity of NTL was tested, which provided biochemical characterizations of the mannose-binding lectin from Chinese Narcissus.</p></details><hr><h4>Effects of glycerol supply and specific growth rate on methanol-free production of CALB by P. pastoris: functional characterisation of a novel promoter.</h4><p>V. Looser et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130631>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella sp.) yeast can secrete pure recombinant proteins at high rates, it is a desirable production system. The function of a novel synthetic variant of the AOX1 promoter was characterised comprehensively using a strain secreting Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a model. A new time-saving approach was introduced to determine, in only one experiment, the hitherto unknown relationship between specific product formation rate (q p) and specific growth rate (mu). Tight control of recombinant protein formation was possible in the absence of methanol, while using glycerol as a sole carbon/energy source. CALB was not synthesised during batch cultivation in excess glycerol (>10 g l-1) and at a growth rate close to mu max (0.15 h-1). Between 0.017 and 0.115 h-1 in glycerol-limited fedbatch cultures, basal levels of q p > 0.4 mg g-1 h-1 CALB were reached, independent of the mu at which the culture grew. At mu > 0.04 h-1, an elevated q p occurred temporarily during the first 20 h after changing to fedbatch mode and decreased thereafter to basal. In order to accelerate the determination of the q p(mu) relationship (kinetics of product formation), the entire mu range was covered in a single fedbatch experiment. By linearly increasing and decreasing glycerol addition rates, mu values were repeatedly shifted from 0.004 to 0.074 h-1 and vice versa. Changes in q p were related to changes in mu. A rough estimation of mu range suitable for production was possible in a single fedbatch, thus significantly reducing the experimental input over previous approaches comprising several experiments.</p></details><hr><h4>Novel function of Wsc proteins as a methanol-sensing machinery in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Ohsawa, H. Yurimoto, Y. Sakai, Mol Microbiol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28127815>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Wsc family proteins are plasma membrane spanning sensor proteins conserved from yeasts to mammalian cells. We studied the functional roles of Wsc family proteins in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and found that PpWsc1 and PpWsc3 function as methanol-sensors during growth on methanol. PpWsc1 responds to a lower range of methanol concentrations than PpWsc3. PpWsc1, but not PpWsc3, also functions during high temperature stress, but PpWsc1 senses methanol as a signal that is distinct from high-temperature stress. We also found that PpRom2, which is known to function downstream of the Wsc family proteins in the cell wall integrity pathway, was also involved in sensing methanol. Based on these results, these PpWsc family proteins were demonstrated to be involved in sensing methanol and transmitting the signal via their cytoplasmic tail to the nucleus via PpRom2, which plays a critical role in regulating expression of a subset of methanol-inducible genes to coordinate well-balanced methanol metabolism.</p></details><hr><h4>A Recombinant Human Anti-Platelet scFv Antibody Produced in Pichia pastoris for Atheroma Targeting.</h4><p>A.

Here, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and immunoreactivity assessment of a recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a human anti-alphaIIbbeta3 antibody (HuAb) selected to target atheromatous lesions for the presence of platelets. Indeed, platelets within atheroma plaques have been shown to play a role in inflammation, in platelet-leucocyte aggregates and in thrombi formation and might thus be considered relevant biomarkers of atherosclerotic progression. The DNA sequence that encodes the anti-alphaIIbbeta3 TEG4 scFv previously obtained from a phage-display selection on activated platelets, was inserted into the eukaryote vector (pPICZalphaA) in fusion with a tag sequence encoding 2 cysteines useable for specific probes grafting experiments. The recombinant protein was expressed at high yields in Pichia pastoris (30 mg/L culture). The advantage of P. pastoris as an expression system is the production and secretion of recombinant proteins in the supernatant, ruling out the difficulties encountered when scFv are produced in the cytoplasm of bacteria (low yield, low solubility and reduced affinity). The improved conditions allowed for the recovery of highly purified and biologically active scFv fragments ready to be grafted in a site-directed way to nanoparticles for the imaging of atherosclerotic plaques involving inflammatory processes and thus at high risk of instability.</p></details><hr><h4>Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme (LRE) Crystal Structure Is Solved but its Function Is Still Unclear.</h4><p>S. Hosseinkhani et al., Photochem Photobiol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28120440>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Contribution of Luciferin-Regenerating Enzyme (LRE) for in vitro recycling of D-luciferin has been reported. According to crystal structure of LRE, it is a beta-propeller protein which is a type of all-beta protein architecture. In this overview, reinvestigation of the luciferase-based LRE assays and its function is reported. Until now, sequence of LRE genes from 4 different species of firefly has been reported. In spite of previous reports, T-LRE (from Lampyris turkestanicus) was cloned and expressed in E. coli as well as Pichia pastoris in a non-soluble form as inclusion body. According to recent investigations, bioluminescent signal of soluble T-LRE-luciferase-coupled assay increased and then reached an equilibrium state in the presence of D-cysteine. In addition, the results revealed that both D- and L-cysteine in the absence of T-LRE caused a significant increase in bioluminescence intensity of luciferase over a long time. Based on activity measurements and spectroscopic results, D-cysteine increased the activity of luciferase due to its redox potential and induction of conformational changes in structure and kinetics properties. In conclusion, in spite of previous reports on the effect of LRE (at least T-LRE) on luciferase activity, most of the increase of luciferase activity is caused by direct effect of D-cysteine on structure and activity of firefly luciferase. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis cannot support the presence of LRE in peroxisome of photocytes in firefly lanterns. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we demonstrate label-free detection of individual proteins from Escherichia coli (bacteria) and Pichia pastoris (yeast) immobilized in a microfluidic chamber, measuring protein efflux from single organisms in real time. The array is fabricated using non-covalent conjugation of an aptamer-anchor polynucleotide sequence to near-infrared emissive single-walled carbon nanotubes, using a variable chemical spacer shown to optimize sensor response. Unlabelled RAP1 GTPase and HIV integrase proteins were selectively detected from various cell lines, via large near-infrared fluorescent turn-on responses. We show that the process of E. coli induction, protein synthesis and protein export is highly stochastic, yielding variability in protein secretion, with E. coli cells undergoing division under starved conditions producing 66% fewer secreted protein products than their non-dividing counterparts. We further demonstrate the detection of a unique protein product resulting from T7 bacteriophage infection of E. coli, illustrating that nanosensor arrays can enable real-time, single-cell analysis of a broad range of protein products from various cell types.</p></details><hr><h4>Extremely low frequency magnetic field enhances glucose oxidase expression in Pichia pastoris GS115.</h4><p>A.

GOX encoding gene from A. niger was expressed in P. pastoris GS115 employing methanol inducible AOX1 promoter. From resistant transformants to high zeocin concentrations, maximum GOX expressing transformant was isolated and used throughout the study. Optimal environmental conditions for achieving maximum glucose oxidase (GOX) production was determined by varying temperature (20-30 degrees C) and final methanol concentration from 0.25-1% (v/v). Maximum GOX production was obtained at 20 degrees C and 0.25% (v/v) final methanol concentration. Exposure carried out at extremely low frequencies ranging from 1 to 5Hz and the field strength of 30-100mT unceasingly. Biomass, GOX, protease productions and cell viability were examined in exposed and non-exposed groups every 12h up to 96h. Among different exposure conditions, the frequency of 2.8Hz significantly increased GOX production and cell viability, decreased non-specific protease activity and improved biomass production regardless of changes in field intensity. Overall, supported by results, P. pastoris exposure to ELF-MF in certain circumstances could effectively further increase maximum production of GOX as achieved by optimized preliminary environmental parameters.</p></details><hr><h4>Biochemical characterization of thermostable beta-1,4-mannanase belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 134 from Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>K.

Recombinant AoMan134A was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the purified enzyme produced mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, and mannopentaose from galactose-free beta-mannan, with mannotriose being the predominant reaction product. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of AoMan134A was 6.8-fold higher toward galactomannan from locust bean gum, than toward galactomannan from guar gum, but similar toward galactomannan from locust bean gum and glucomannan from konjac flour. After incubation at 70 degrees C for 120 min, the activity of AoMan134A toward glucomannan decreased to 50% of the maximal activity at 30 degrees C. AoMan134A retained 50% of its beta-1,4-mannanase activity after heating at 90 degrees C for 30 min, indicating that AoMan134A is thermostable. Furthermore, AoMan134A was stable within a neutral-to-alkaline pH range, as well as exhibiting stability in the presence of a range of organic solvents, detergents, and metal ions. These findings suggest that AoMan134A could be useful in a diverse range of industries where conversion of beta-mannans is of prime importance.</p></details><hr><h4>Direct bioethanol production from wheat straw using xylose/glucose co-fermentation by co-culture of two recombinant yeasts.</h4><p>Y.

Recombinant S. cerevisiae coexpressing three types of cellulase and recombinant P. pastoris coexpressing two types of xylanase were constructed, respectively. All cellulases and xylanases were successfully expressed and similar extracellular activity was demonstrated. The maximum ethanol concentration of 32.6 g L-1 with the yield 0.42 g g-1 was achieved from wheat straw corresponding to 100 g L-1 of total sugar after 80 h co-fermentation, which corresponds to 82.6% of the theoretical yield. These results demonstrate that the direct and efficient ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials is accomplished by simultaneous saccharification (cellulose and hemicellulose) and co-fermentation (glucose and xylose) with the co-culture of the two recombinant yeasts.</p></details><hr><h4>A Recombinant Highly Thermostable beta-Mannanase (ReTMan26) from Thermophilic Bacillus subtilis (TBS2) Expressed in Pichia pastoris and Its pH and Temperature Stability.</h4><p>Z.

The maximum activity of the recombinant thermostable beta-mannanase (ReTMan26) was 5435 U/mL, which was obtained by high-density, fed-batch cultivation after 168-h induction with methanol in a 50-L bioreactor. The protein yield reached 3.29 mg/mL, and the protein had a molecular weight of ~42 kDa. After fermentation, ReTMan26 was purified using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane and Sephadex G-75 column. The pH and temperature optima of purified ReTMan26 were pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively, and the enzyme was stable at pH 2.0-8.0 and was active at 20-100 degrees C. HPLC analysis of the products of locust bean gum hydrolysis showed that the mannan-oligosaccharide content was 62.5%. ReTMan26 retained 58.6% of its maximum activity after treatment at 100 degrees C for 10 min, which was higher than any other beta-mannanase reported up to now, suggesting its potential for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Functional Characterization of the N-Terminal C2 Domain from Arabidopsis thaliana Phospholipase Dalpha and Dbeta.</h4><p>R.

In this study, we expressed and partially purified catalytically active PLDalpha from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPLDalpha) in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant AtPLDalpha was found to be NVEETIGV and thus to lack the first 35 amino acid belonging to the C2 domain, as found in other recombinant or plant purified PLDs. To investigate the impact of such a cleavage on the functionality of C2 domains, we expressed, in E. coli, purified, and refolded the mature-like form of the C2 domain of the AtPLDalpha along with its equivalent C2 domain of the AtPLDbeta, for the sake of comparison. Using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and dot-blot assays, both C2 domains were shown to bind phosphatidylglycerol in a Ca2+-independent manner while phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine binding were found to be enhanced in the presence of Ca2+. Amino acid sequence alignment and molecular modeling of both C2 domains with known C2 domain structures revealed the presence of a novel Ca2+-binding site within the C2 domain of AtPLDalpha.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of human pro-relaxin H2 in the yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

All these findings make relaxin a potential drug for diverse medical applications. Its precursor, pro-relaxin, is an 18 kDa protein, that shows activity in in vitro assays. Since extraction of relaxin from animal tissues raises several issues, prokaryotes and eukaryotes were both used as expression systems for recombinant relaxin production. Most productive results were obtained when using Escherichia coli as a host for human relaxin expression. However, in such host, relaxin precipitated in the form of inclusion bodies and, therefore, required several expensive recovery steps as cell lysis, refolding and reduction.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> To overcome the issues related to prokaryotic expression here we report the production and purification of secreted human pro-relaxin H2 by using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host. The methanol inducible promoter AOX1 was used to drive expression of the native and histidine tagged forms of pro-relaxin H2 in dual phase fed-batch experiments on the 22 L scale. Both protein forms presented the correct structure, as determined by mass spectrometry and western blotting analyses, and demonstrated to be biologically active in immune enzymatic assays. The presence of the tag allowed to simplify pro-relaxin purification obtaining higher purity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This work presents a strategy for microbial production of recombinant human pro-relaxin H2 in Pichia pastoris that allowed the obtainment of biologically active pro-hormone, with a final concentration in the fermentation broth ranging between 10 and 14 mg/L of product, as determined by densitometric analyses.</p></details><hr><h4>Age-related macular degeneration associated polymorphism rs10490924 in ARMS2 results in deficiency of a complement activator.</h4><p>S.

The polymorphism rs10490924 in the ARMS2 gene is highly associated with AMD and linked to an indel mutation (del443ins54), the latter inducing mRNA instability. At present, the function of the ARMS2 protein, the exact cellular sources in the retina and the biological consequences of the rs10490924 polymorphism are unclear.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> Recombinant ARMS2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and protein functions were studied regarding cell surface binding and complement activation in human serum using fluoresence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as well as laser scanning microscopy (LSM). Biolayer interferometry defined protein interactions. Furthermore, endogenous ARMS2 gene expression was studied in human blood derived monocytes and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iPSdM) by PCR and LSM. The ARMS2 protein was localized in human genotyped retinal sections and in purified monocytes derived from AMD patients without the ARMS2 risk variant by LSM. ARMS2 expression in monocytes under oxidative stress was determined by Western blot analysis.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Here, we demonstrate for the first time that ARMS2 functions as surface complement regulator. Recombinant ARMS2 binds to human apoptotic and necrotic cells and initiates complement activation by recruiting the complement activator properdin. ARMS2-properdin complexes augment C3b surface opsonization for phagocytosis. We also demonstrate for the first time expression of ARMS2 in human monocytes especially under oxidative stress and in microglia cells of the human retina. The ARMS2 protein is absent in monocytes and also in microglia cells, derived from patients homozygous for the ARMS2 AMD risk variant (rs10490924).</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> ARMS2 is likely involved in complement-mediated clearance of cellular debris. As AMD patients present with accumulated proteins and lipids on Bruch's membrane, ARMS2 protein deficiency due to the genetic risk variant might be involved in drusen formation.</p></details><hr><h4>A genetic method to enhance the accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine in yeast.</h4><p>M.

The enzymes showed similar enzymatic properties (maximal activities at pH 6.0-6.5 and 65 degrees C) but varied in catalytic efficiency and cleaving actions. MtXyn11A, MtXyn11At, and MtXyn11C mainly produced xylobiose (59-62%), xylose (16-20%), and xylotriose (16-19%), while MtXyn11B released xylobiose (51%), xylotriose (32%), and xylose (12%) as the main products. When using the xylan hydrolysates of different xylanases as the carbon source, four probiotic Lactobacillus strains Lactobacillus brevis 1.2028, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei BL23, and Lactobacillus plantarum WCSF1 were confirmed to use the xylooligosaccharides efficiently (83.8-98.2%), with L. brevis 1.2028 as the greatest.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and characteristics of the recombinant extracellular bifunctional endoglucanase of the polyextremophilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans and its applicability in saccharifying agro-residues.</h4><p>R.

A higher titre of recombinant BhCell-Xyl was attained after induction (4.8 U mL-1) as compared to that of the constitutive production (2.1 U mL-1). The recombinant P. pastoris strains integrated two copies of BhCell-Xyl under AOX and GAP promoters. The pure recombinant BhCell-Xyl is a glycoprotein of 66 kDa, which is optimally active at 60 degrees C and pH 6.0 and 8.0. Glycosylated BhCell-Xyl exhibits higher thermostability than that of the native enzyme. The analysis of amino acids of BhCell-Xyl revealed that multiple factors are responsible for its thermostability. Kinetics and in silico analysis of the enzyme suggested that BhCell-Xyl has one active site for both endocellulase and endoxylanase activities. The BhCell-Xyl possesses a carbohydrate binding domain and saccharifies lignocellulosic agro-residues to xylo-oligosaccharides and cello-oligosaccharides, suggesting its potential application in generating fermentable sugars from renewable agro-residues for biofuel and fine chemical industries.</p></details><hr><h4>N-glycosylation converts non-glycoproteins into mannose receptor ligands and reveals antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo.</h4><p>C. Kreer et al., Oncotarget 8 6857 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28036287>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>N-glycosylation is generally accepted to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens because of two main reasons. First, the attachment of glycans enables recognition by endocytic receptors like the mannose receptor (MR) and hence increased uptake by dendritic cells (DCs). Second, foreign glycans are postulated to be immunostimulatory and their recognition could induce DC activation. However, a direct comparison between the immunogenicity of N-glycosylated vs. de-glycosylated proteins in vivo and a direct effect of N-glycosylated antigens on the intrinsic capacity of DCs to activate T cells have not been assessed so far.To analyze whether enforced N-glycosylation is a suited strategy to enhance the immunogenicity of non-glycosylated antigens for vaccination studies, we targeted non-glycoproteins towards the MR by introduction of artificial N-glycosylation using the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (previously termed Pichia pastoris). We could demonstrate that the introduction of a single N-X-S/T motif was sufficient for efficient MR-binding and internalization. However, addition of N-glycosylated proteins neither influenced DC maturation nor their general capacity to activate T cells, pointing out that enforced N-glycosylation does not increase the immunogenicity of the antigen per se. Additionally, increased antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo after injection of N-glycosylated compared to de-glycosylated proteins were observed but this effect strongly depended on the epitope tested. A beneficial effect of N-glycosylation on antibody production could not be detected, which might be due to MR-cross-linking on DCs and to concomitant differences in IL-6 production by CD4+ T cells.These observations point out that the effect of N-glycosylation on antigen immunogenicity can vary between different antigens and therefore might have important implications for the development of vaccines using K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>A comparative study of glycerol and sorbitol as co-substrates in methanol-induced cultures of Pichia pastoris: temperature effect and scale-up simulation.</h4><p>J.

Although both co-substrates have been widely used, comparative studies are scarce. In addition, these comparisons have been performed at different specific growth rate (micro) that it is well known that has an important effect on productivity. Thus, the effect of using these co-substrates on the production of Rhyzopus oryzae lipase (ROL) by P. pastoris was compared in continuous cultures growing at the same micro at either 22 or 30 degrees C. Results show that using glycerol as co-substrate led to higher volumetric productivities, and lower specific and volumetric methanol consumption rates. Scale-up simulation with 10-10,000 L bioreactor sizes indicated that glycerol produced the highest volumetric productivity of ROL with lower aeration requirements. Therefore, glycerol rises as a better option than sorbitol in ROL production.</p></details><hr><h4>Biotechnological exploitation of Tetrapisispora phaffii killer toxin: heterologous production in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris).</h4><p>R. Chessa et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28032192>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The use of natural antimicrobials from plants, animals and microorganisms to inhibit the growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms is becoming more frequent. This parallels the increased consumer interest towards consumption of minimally processed food and 'greener' food and beverage additives. Among the natural antimicrobials of microbial origin, the killer toxin produced by the yeast Tetrapisispora phaffii, known as Kpkt, appears to be a promising natural antimicrobial agent. Kpkt is a glycoprotein with beta-1,3-glucanase and killer activity, which induces ultrastructural modifications to the cell wall of yeast of the genera Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora and Zygosaccharomyces. Moreover, Kpkt maintains its killer activity in grape must for at least 14 days under winemaking conditions, thus suggesting its use against spoilage yeast in wine making and the sweet beverage industry. Here, the aim was to explore the possibility of high production of Kpkt for biotechnological exploitation. Molecular tools for heterologous production of Kpkt in Komagataella phaffii GS115 were developed, and two recombinant clones that produce up to 23 mg/L recombinant Kpkt (rKpkt) were obtained. Similar to native Kpkt, rKpkt has beta-glucanase and killer activities. Moreover, it shows a wider spectrum of action with respect to native Kpkt. This includes effects on Dekkera bruxellensis, a spoilage yeast of interest not only in wine making, but also for the biofuel industry, thus widening the potential applications of this rKpkt.</p></details><hr><h4>A capture method based on the VC1 domain reveals new binding properties of the human receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE).</h4><p>G. Degani et al., Redox Biol 11 275 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28013188>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Advanced Glycation and Lipoxidation End products (AGEs and ALEs) are a heterogeneous class of compounds derived from the non-enzymatic glycation or protein adduction by lipoxidation break-down products. The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is involved in the progression of chronic diseases based on persistent inflammatory state and oxidative stress. RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and the inhibition of the interaction with its ligands or of the ligand accumulation have a potential therapeutic effect. The N-terminal domain of RAGE, the V domain, is the major site of AGEs binding and is stabilized by the adjacent C1 domain. In this study, we set up an affinity assay relying on the extremely specific biological interaction AGEs ligands have for the VC1 domain. A glycosylated form of VC1, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, was attached to magnetic beads and used as insoluble affinity matrix (VC1-resin). The VC1 interaction assay was employed to isolate specific VC1 binding partners from in vitro generated AGE-albumins and modifications were identified/localized by mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, this method also led to the isolation of ALEs produced by malondialdehyde treatment of albumins. Computational studies provided a rational-based interpretation of the contacts established by specific modified residues and amino acids of the V domain. The validation of VC1-resin in capturing AGE-albumins from complex biological mixtures such as plasma and milk, may lead to the identification of new RAGE ligands potentially involved in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses, independently of their structures or physical properties, and without the use of any covalent derivatization process. In addition, the method can be applied to the identification of antagonists of RAGE-ligand interaction.</p></details><hr><h4>Physicochemical characterization and immunological properties of Pichia pastoris based HPV16L1 and 18L1 virus like particles.</h4><p>G.

Presently HPV vaccines, which are commercially available, are adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLPs) expressed from various recombinant expression systems. They have been characterized by different methods as safe, pure, and potent HPV vaccine antigens. We cloned and expressed L1 proteins of HPV16 & 18 in Pichia pastoris and tested their immunogenicity. We observed that HPVL1 proteins (16L1 and 18L1) are expressed in Pichia pastoris at high levels. Critical physicochemical parameters of these HPV recombinant L1 proteins were characterized by SDS PAGE, western blotting, peptide mapping, glycosylation pattern, mass spectrometry, host cell DNA and protein analysis, electron microscopy, and immunogenicity analysis. These data establish a blueprint of HPV recombinant protein antigens for standardizing & developing an alternative high-quality, cost-effective vaccine for HPV as well as similar recombinant protein-based vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Rational design for the stability improvement of Armillariella tabescens beta-mannanase MAN47 based on N-glycosylation modification.</h4><p>W.

In this study, we sought to improve the stability and protease resistance of a recombinant beta-mannanase, MAN47 from Armillariella tabescens, through rationally designed N-glycosylation. Based on homology modeling, molecular docking, secondary structure analysis and glycosylation feasibility analysis, an enhanced aromatic sequon sequence was introduced into specific MAN47 loop regions to facilitate N-glycosylation. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168, and their thermal stability, pH stability, trypsin resistance and pepsin resistance were determined. Two mutant MAN47 enzymes, g-123 and g-347, were glycosylated as expected when expressed in yeast, and their thermal stability, pH stability, and protease resistance were significantly improved compared to the wild-type enzyme. An enzyme with multiple stability characterizations has broad prospects in practical applications, and the rational design N-glycosylation strategy may have applications in simultaneously improving several properties of other biotechnological targets.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of a beta-glucosidase from the xylophagous cockroach Panesthia angustipennis spadica displaying high specific activity for cellobiose.</h4><p>Y.

Post-translational modification and N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that the expression product was comprised of two polypeptides with different N-terminal sequences, presumably due to the presence of lysine-arginine (KR) sequence in the putative mature region. Substrate specificity analysis showed that PaBG1b hydrolyzed a broad range of substrates including cellohexaose, with the preference for aryl beta-d-fucosyl linkage and laminaribiose. Although the glucose tolerance of PaBG1b was moderate (Ki=200.3+/-1.1mM), PaBG1b demonstrated high specific activity and catalytic efficiency towards cellobiose with Vmax and kcat/Km values of 436.7+/-6.3U/mg and 109.8mM-1s-1, respectively. In addition, PaBG1b was not inhibited by cellobiose up to the highest concentration tested (100mM). Collectively, our work demonstrates that PaBG1b is a potentially valuable BG for commercial bioethanol production from cellulose.</p></details><hr><h4>Gene cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of a Coprinopsis cinerea endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanase.</h4><p>J. Wang, L. Kang, Z. Liu, S.

ENG16A only acts on substrates containing beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds but not on substrates containing only beta-1,4- or beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds. Interestingly, compared to the activity of this enzyme towards carboxymethyl (CM)-pachyman containing only beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, its activity towards barley beta-glucan containing both beta-1,3-glycosidic and beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds was increased by 64.72 %,, its activity towards laminarin containing both beta-1,3-glycosidic and beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds was decreased by 50.83 %. In addition, ENG16A has a higher Km value and Vmax for barley beta-glucan than laminarin, which may be related to the fact that barley beta-glucan contains mainly beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds mixed with a few beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, whereas laminarin mainly contains beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds with a few beta-1,6-branched glucose residues. The adjacent beta-1,4-glycosidic bond promotes ENG16A to hydrolyse beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, leading to an increased Vmax; the nearby beta-1,6-glycosidic bonds inhibited its hydrolysis of beta-1,3-glycosidic bonds, resulting in a decreased Vmax. This property is suggested to be related to the mechanism that C. cinerea uses to degrade and utilize hemicellulose in straw medium and to protect its cell wall during the mycelium growth stage.</p></details><hr><h4>Biologically active recombinant carp LH as a spawning-inducing agent for carp.</h4><p>J.

The main goal of this study was the production of recombinant gonadotropins (GtHs) on a large scale to serve as an alternative to currently used agents. We produced carp (c) recombinant (r) Lh as a single chain in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris Lha subunit was joined with Lhb subunit with a flexible linker of three glycine-serine repeats and six Histidines to form a mature protein, the beta-subunit formed the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit formed the C-terminal part. The ability of the rcLh to elicit biological response was tested by in vivo stimulation of estradiol (E2) and 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and by its in vivo potency to induce ovulation and spawning induction. rcLh tested in this work significantly enhanced both E2 and DHP secretion in a dose-dependent manner similar to the results obtained with CPE. E2 levels showed a moderate rise following the priming injection and a subsequent decrease during the rest of the trial. DHP levels were only increased after the resolving injection, approximately 5 h before spawning. At the highest dose of rcLh (350 microg/kg BW), the recombinant protein was more efficient than CPE in terms of both spawning success and fertilization rate. It is shown here that rcLh can elicit the secretion of DHP in vivo and actually trigger spawning. These novel findings introduce the potential of utilizing recombinant gonadotropins in aquaculture.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of recombinant human epidermal growth factor in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

For this aim, the hEGF gene was cloned into the pPIC9K expression vector, and then integrated into P. pastoris by electroporation. ELISA-based assay showed that the amount of hEGF secreted into the medium can be affected by the fermentation conditions especially by culture medium, pH and temperature. The best medium for the optimal hEGF production was BMMY buffered at a pH range of 6.0 and 7.0. The highest amount of hEGF with an average yield of 2.27mug/mL was obtained through an induction of the culture with 0.5% (v/v) methanol for 60h. The artificial neural network (ANN) analysis revealed that changes in both pH and temperature significantly affected the hEGF production with the pH change had slightly higher impact on hEGF production than variations in the temperature.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of Paranosema (Antonospora) locustae hexokinase in lepidopteran, Sf9, cells is followed by accumulation of the microsporidian protein in insect cell nuclei.</h4><p>S.

Here, the microsporidian protein was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and in lepidopteran Sf9 cells. During heterologous expression, P. locustae hexokinase was accumulated in the nuclei of insect cells but not in yeast cell nuclei. This confirms nuclear localization of hexokinase secreted by microsporidia into infected host cells and suggests convenient model for its further study.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural characterization of the alpha-mating factor prepro-peptide for secretion of recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S. Chahal et al., Gene   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27984193>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been used extensively for expressing recombinant proteins because it combines the ease of genetic manipulation, the ability to provide complex posttranslational modifications and the capacity for efficient protein secretion. The most successful and commonly used secretion signal leader in Pichia pastoris has been the alpha mating factor (MATalpha) prepro secretion signal. However, limitations exist as some proteins cannot be secreted efficiently, leading to strategies to enhance secretion efficiency by modifying the secretion signal leader. Based on a Jpred secondary structure prediction and knob-socket modeling of tertiary structure, numerous deletions and duplications of the MATalpha prepro leader were engineered to evaluate the correlation between predicted secondary structure and the secretion level of the reporters horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Candida antarctica lipase B. In addition, circular dichroism analyses were completed for the wild type and several mutant pro-peptides to evaluate actual differences in secondary structure. The results lead to a new model of MATalpha pro-peptide signal leader, which suggests that the N and C-termini of MATalpha pro-peptide need to be presented in a specific orientation for proper interaction with the cellular secretion machinery and for efficient protein secretion.</p></details><hr><h4>Synthetic Core Promoters as Universal Parts for Fine-Tuning Expression in Different Yeast Species.</h4><p>R. M. Portela et al., ACS Synth Biol   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973777>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering experiments frequently require the fine-tuning of gene expression to balance and optimize protein levels of regulators or metabolic enzymes. A key concept of synthetic biology is the development of modular parts that can be used in different contexts. Here, we have applied a computational multifactor design approach to generate de novo synthetic core promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) for yeast cells. In contrast to upstream cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), core promoters are typically not subject to specific regulation, making them ideal engineering targets for gene expression fine-tuning. 112 synthetic core promoter sequences were designed on the basis of the sequence/function relationship of natural core promoters, nucleosome occupancy and the presence of short motifs. The synthetic core promoters were fused to the Pichia pastoris AOX1 CRM, and the resulting activity spanned more than a 200-fold range (0.3% to 70.6% of the wild type AOX1 level). The top-ten synthetic core promoters with highest activity were fused to six additional CRMs (three in P. pastoris and three in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Inducible CRM constructs showed significantly higher activity than constitutive CRMs, reaching up to 176% of natural core promoters. Comparing the activity of the same synthetic core promoters fused to different CRMs revealed high correlations only for CRMs within the same organism. These data suggest that modularity is maintained to some extent but only within the same organism. Due to the conserved role of eukaryotic core promoters, this rational design concept may be transferred to other organisms as a generic engineering tool.</p></details><hr><h4>Non-canonical integration events in Pichia pastoris encountered during standard transformation analysed with genome sequencing.</h4><p>J.

Typically, the expression cassette is integrated into the genome via homologous recombination. Due to unknown integration events, a large clonal variability is often encountered consisting of clones with different productivities as well as aberrant morphological or growth characteristics. In this study, we analysed several clones with abnormal colony morphology and discovered unpredicted integration events via whole genome sequencing. These include (i) the relocation of the locus targeted for replacement to another chromosome (ii) co-integration of DNA from the E. coli plasmid host and (iii) the disruption of untargeted genes affecting colony morphology. Most of these events have not been reported so far in literature and present challenges for genetic engineering approaches in this yeast. Especially, the presence and independent activity of E. coli DNA elements in P. pastoris is of concern. In our study, we provide a deeper insight into these events and their potential origins. Steps preventing or reducing the risk for these phenomena are proposed and will help scientists working on genetic engineering of P. pastoris or similar non-conventional yeast to better understand and control clonal variability.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression, characterization, and application of a phospholipase B from Fusarium oxysporum.</h4><p>L. Su et al., J Biotechnol 242 92 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940286>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this study, a gene encoding a putative lipase from Fusarium oxysporum was optimized via codon optimization and expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71. The gene product was identified as a phospholipase B (PLB). The engineered P. pastoris was further cultured in a 3.6-L bioreactor. After optimization of the induction conditions, this system produced 6.6mgmL-1 protein and 6503.8UmL-1 PLB activity in the culture medium. Efficient expression of this PLB in P. pastoris should reduce the costs of production and application. The purified enzyme, with a specific activity of 1170Umg-1, was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. The results of a degumming experiment performed using the recombinant PLB showed that the phosphorus content of a test oil was decreased from 75.88ppm to 3.3ppm in 2h under optimal reaction conditions. This study provides a basis for the industrial use of F. oxysporum PLB in oil degumming applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Kinase Screening in Pichia pastoris Identified Promising Targets Involved in Cell Growth and Alcohol Oxidase 1 Promoter (PAOX1) Regulation.</h4><p>W.

However, the complicated signaling pathways involved in PAOX1 regulation when supplemented with different carbon sources are poorly understood. Here we constructed a kinase deletion library in P. pastoris and identified 27 mutants which showed peculiar phenotypes in cell growth or PAOX1 regulation. We analyzed both annotations and possible functions of these 27 targets, and then focused on the MAP kinase Hog1. In order to locate its potential downstream components, we performed the phosphoproteome analysis on glycerol cultured WT and Deltahog1 strains and identified 157 differentially phosphorylated proteins. Our results identified important kinases involved in P. pastoris cell growth and PAOX1 regulation, which could serve as valuable targets for further mechanistic studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Elimination of N-glycosylation by site mutation further prolongs the half-life of IFN-alpha/Fc fusion proteins expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

Three different forms of IgG1 Fc fragments, including the wild type, aglycosylated homodimer and aglycosylated single chain, were each fused with IFN-alpha and designated as IFN-alpha/Fc-WT, IFN-alpha/Fc-MD, and IFN-alpha/Fc-SC, respectively. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and tested using antiviral and pharmacokinetic assays in comparison with the commercial pegylated-IFN-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha). The in vitro study demonstrated that IFN-alpha/Fc-SC has the highest antiviral activity, while IFN-alpha/Fc-WT and IFN-alpha/Fc-MD exhibited antiviral activities comparable to that of PEG-IFN-alpha. The in vivo pharmacokinetic assay showed that both IFN-alpha/Fc-WT and IFN-alpha/Fc-MD have a longer half-life than PEG-IFN-alpha in SD rats, but IFN-alpha/Fc-SC has the shortest half-life among them. Importantly, the circulating half-life of 68.3 h for IFN-alpha/Fc-MD was significantly longer than those of 38.2 h for IFN-alpha/Fc-WT and 22.2 h for PEG-IFN-alpha.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The results demonstrate that the elimination of N-glycosylation by mutation of putative N-glycosylation site further prolongs the half-life of the IFN-alpha/Fc fusion protein and could present an alternative strategy for extending the half-life of low-molecular-weight proteins expressed by P. pastoris for in vivo studies as well as for future clinical applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Characteristics and applications of recombinant thermostable amylopullulanase of Geobacillus thermoleovorans secreted by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

The expression of the gene (Gt-apuDeltaC) was higher under GAP promoter (36.2 U ml-1, alpha-amylase; 33.5 U ml-1, pullulanase) than that under AOX1 promoter (32.5 and 28.6 U ml-1). The heavily glycosylated Gt-apuDeltaC from the recombinant P. pastoris displays higher substrate specificity, thermal stability and starch saccharification efficiency than that expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme hydrolyses maltotriose and maltotetraose unlike that expressed in E. coli. The enzyme action on wheat bran liberates maltose and glucose without detectable amount(s) of maltooligosaccharides. The sugars released from wheat bran (glucose and maltose) could be fractionated by ultrafiltration, as confirmed by TLC and HPLC analysis. This is the first report on the production of recombinant amylopullulanase extracellularly in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Effect of Glycosylation on the Biocatalytic Properties of Hydroxynitrile Lyase from the Passion Fruit, Passiflora edulis: A Comparison of Natural and Recombinant Enzymes.</h4><p>A.

Cyanohydrins are important building blocks for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Thus, to enhance production yields of PeHNL for industrial applications, we cloned and expressed recombinant PeHNL in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris GS115 cells without a signal peptide sequence. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of N-glycosylation on enzyme stability and catalytic properties in microbial expression systems. PeHNL from leaves (PeHNL-N) and that expressed in P. pastoris (PeHNL-P) were glycosylated, whereas that expressed in E. coli (PeHNL-E) was not. The enzymes PeHNL-N and PeHNL-P showed much better thermostability, pH stability, and organic solvent tolerance than the deglycosylated enzyme PeHNL-E and the deglycosylated mutant N105Q from P. pastoris (PeHNL-P-N105Q). The glycosylated PeHNL-P also efficiently performed transcyanation of (R)-mandelonitrile with a 98 % enantiomeric excess in a biphasic system with diisopropyl ether. These data demonstrate the efficacy of these methods for improving enzyme expression and stability for industrial application through N-glycosylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as a chassis organism for polyketide synthesis via the full citrinin biosynthetic pathway.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, we tested the potential of the industrial methylotrophic yeast strain Pichia pastoris for the heterologous synthesis of polyketides. A recombinant P. pastoris GS-pksCT-npgA carrying the Monascus purpureus citrinin polyketide synthase gene pksCT and the Aspergillus nidulans phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene npgA was constructed. Subsequently, a specific compound was isolated and identified as citrinin intermediate trimethylated pentaketide aldehyde. On account of the hypothetic functions of the genes in the citrinin gene cluster, mpl1 encoding serine hydrolase, mpl2 encoding oxygenase, and mpl4 encoding dehydrogenase were gradually expressed. Proteins were also normally expressed, but a new compound was undetected. Basing on the recently reported citrinin gene cluster in Monascus ruber, we obtained two other genes (mpl6 and mpl7) participating in citrinin biosynthesis by genome walking in M. purpureus. Then, we co-transformed intron-removed mpl6 and mpl7 into the P. pastoris strain carrying pksCT, npgA, mpl1, mpl2, and mpl4. All genes were activated by the methanol-induced AOX1 promoter, and a complete biosynthetic pathway of citrinin was assembled. Finally, citrinin was successfully produced under methanol induction in P. pastoris. These results prove that P. pastoris is a promising chassis organism for polyketide production.</p></details><hr><h4>A Simplified and Efficient Process for Insulin Production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

In this manuscript we describe improvements to key steps in the insulin production process in Pichia pastoris that reduce cost and time. The strategy for recovery and processing of human insulin precursor has been streamlined to two steps from bioreactor to the transpeptidation reaction. In the first step the insulin precursor secreted during the methanol induction phase is recovered directly from the culture broth using Tangential Flow Filtration with a Prostak module eliminating the laborious and time-consuming multi-step clarification, including centrifugation. In the second step the protein is applied at very high loadings on a cation exchange resin and eluted in a mixture of water and ethanol to obtain a concentrated insulin precursor, suitable for use directly in the transpeptidation reaction. Overall the yield from insulin precursor to human insulin was 51% and consisted of three purification chromatography steps. In addition we describe a method for recovery of the excess of H-Thr(tBu)-OtBu from the transpeptidation reaction mixture, one of the more costly reagents in the process, along with its successful reuse.</p></details><hr><h4>Recent advances of molecular toolbox construction expand Pichia pastoris in synthetic biology applications.</h4><p>Z.

Expressed mutant in E. coli showed 1.5-fold higher xylanase activity than XynHB at 60 degrees C. The mutant expressed in Pichia pastoris was glycosylated, remained stable for 30 min at 60 degrees C. XynHBN188A optimized based on codon usage bias for P. pastoris (xynHBN188As) showed an increase of 39.5% enzyme activity. The strain Y16 forming the largest hydrolysis halo in the xylan plate was used in shake flask experiments produced an enzyme activity of 6,403 U/ml. The Y16 strain had 9 copies of the recombinant xynHBN188As gene in the genome revealed by qPCR. The enzymatic activity increased to 48,241 U/ml in a 5 L fermentor. Supplement of 15 U/g xylanase enhanced the brightness of paper products by 2% in bleaching experiment, and thereby improved the tensile strength and burst factor by 13% and 6.5%, respectively. XynHBN188As has a great potential in paper industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification, eukaryotic expression and structure & function characterizations of beta-defensin like homologues from Pelodiscus sinensis.</h4><p>H.

Here, 26 genes encoding beta-defensin-like peptides have been identified for the first time in Pelodiscus sinensis using database mining approach. Phylogenetic study confirmed that beta-defensins are fast evolving genes with high rates of sequence substitutions. The expression level of several selected genes in different tissues was examined by RT-PCR. Ps-BDs mainly adopt beta-strands and/or alpha-helix conformations homology modeled by Rosetta program. Further, Ps-BD2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using Ni-NTA column and RT-HPLC. As expected, the rPs-BD2 showed strong antimicrobial activity, but displayed a negligible hemolytic and cytotoxic activity on human erythrocytes and Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cells, respectively. Our results suggested that the Ps-BD2 was produced efficiently in P. pastoris expression system, which makes the large-scale use of rPs-BDs possible in the future clinical practice.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and characterization of a Talaromyces marneffei active phospholipase B expressed in a Pichia pastoris expression system.</h4><p>Y. He et al., Emerg Microbes Infect 5 e120 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876784>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Phospholipase B is a virulence factor for several clinically important pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, but its role in the thermally dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei remains unclear. Here, we provide the first report of the expression of a novel phospholipase gene, designated TmPlb1, from T. marneffei in the eukaryotic expression system of Pichia pastoris GS115. Sensitive real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that the expression of TmPlb1 increased 1.85-fold in the yeast phase compared with the mycelial phase. TmPlb1 contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 732 bp that encodes a protein of 243 amino acids. The conserved serine, aspartate and histidine catalytic triad and the G-X-S-X-G domain of TmPLB1 provide the structural basis for its molecular activity. The ORF of TmPlb1 was successfully cloned into a pPIC9K vector containing an alpha-mating factor secretion signal that allowed the secretory expression of TmPLB1 in P. pastoris. The heterologous protein expression began 12 h after methanol induction and peaked at 96 h. Through analysis with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western blotting and mass spectrometry, we confirmed that TmPLB1 was successfully expressed. Through Ni-affinity chromatography, TmPLB1 was highly purified, and its concentration reached 240.4 mg/L of culture medium. With specific substrates, the phospholipase A1 and phospholipase A2 activities of TmPLB1 were calculated to be 5.96 and 1.59 U/mg, respectively. The high purity and activity of the TmPLB1 obtained here lay a solid foundation for further investigation.</p></details><hr><h4>Catalytic efficiency and thermostability improvement of Suc2 invertase through rational site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>N. Mohandesi et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 96 14 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871374>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Engineering of invertases has come to attention because of increasing demand for possible applications of invertases in various industrial processes. Due to the known physicochemical properties, invertases from micro-organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying SUC2 gene are considered as primary models. To improve thermostability and catalytic efficiency of SUC2 invertase (SInv), six influential residues with Relative Solvent Accessibility<5% were selected through multiple-sequence alignments, molecular modelling, structural and computational analyses. Consequently, SInv and 5 mutants including three mutants with single point substitution [Mut1=P152V, Mut2=S85V and Mut3=K153F)], one mutant with two points [Mut4=S305V-N463V] and one mutant with three points [Mut5=S85V-K153F-T271V] were developed via site-directed mutagenesis and produced using Pichia pastoris as the host. Physicochemical studies on these enzymes indicated that the selected amino acids which were located in the active site region mainly influenced catalytic efficiency. The best improvement belonged to Mut1 (54% increase in Kcat/Km) and Mut3 exhibited the worst effect (90% increase in Km). These results suggest that Pro152 and Lys153 play key role in preparation of the right substrate lodging in the active site of SInv. The best thermostability improvement (16%) was observed for Mut4 in which two hydrophilic residues located on the loops, far from the active site, were replaced by Valines. These results suggest that tactful simultaneous substitution of influential hydrophilic residues in both active site region and peripheral loops with hydrophobic amino acids could result in more thermostable invertases with enhanced catalytic efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient production of recombinant glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus type 2 in Pichia pastoris and its protective efficacy against viral challenge in mice.</h4><p>M.

However, there are no approved vaccines available to prevent HSV-2 infection. The glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-2 is the most important candidate antigen for vaccine development. In this study, a truncated form of gD (codons 1-340, gD1-340) was produced as a secretory protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant gD1-340 with a His6 tag was purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography. Mice immunized with the recombinant gD1-340 developed high levels of antigen-specific antibody responses with HSV-2 neutralizing activity. Immunization with the recombinant gD1-340 conferred significant protection against lethal HSV-2 infection in mice. Moreover, measurement of the secretion of gD1-340-specific cytokines demonstrated that the recombinant gD1-340 induced mixed Th1/Th2 cellular immune responses. These findings indicated that P. pastoris-derived gD1-340 represents a promising HSV-2 vaccine candidate with strong immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy.</p></details><hr><h4>Combined 13C-assisted metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis reveals the impacts of glutamate on the central metabolism of high beta-galactosidase-producing Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>P.

On the other hand, proteases are broadly used in industrial applications and resemble promising drug candidates. Bromelain is an herbal drug that is medicinally used for treatment of oedematous swellings and inflammatory conditions and consists in large part of proteolytic enzymes. Even though various experiments underline the requirement of active cysteine proteases for biological activity, so far no investigation succeeded to clearly clarify the pharmacological mode of action of bromelain. The potential role of proteases themselves and other molecules of this multi-component extract currently remain largely unknown or ill defined. Here, we set out to express several bromelain cysteine proteases as well as a bromelain inhibitor molecule in order to gain defined molecular entities for subsequent studies. After cloning the genes from its natural source Ananas comosus (pineapple plant) into Pichia pastoris and subsequent fermentation and purification, we obtained active protease and inhibitor molecules which were subsequently biochemically characterized. Employing purified bromelain fractions paves the way for further elucidation of pharmacological activities of this natural product. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

The two (His)6-tagged proteins were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography and obtained in quantities of 12 and 15 mg L-1 of culture volume, respectively. Glycosylation sites were identified for the native and for the enzymatically deglycosylated proteins by mass spectrometry, confirming five to six of the seven predicted glycosylation sites in the NxS/T sequence context. The predominant glycan structure was Man5GlcNAc2 with, however, a significant contribution of Man4-10GlcNAc2. Both dirigent proteins (DIRs) mediated the formation of (+)-gossypol by atropselective coupling of hemigossypol radicals. Similar to previously characterized DIRs, GbDIR2 and GhDIR3 lacked oxidizing activity and depended on an oxidizing system (laccase/O2) for the generation of substrate radicals. In contrast to DIRs involved in the biosynthesis of lignans, glycosylation was not essential for function. Quantitative enzymatic deglycosylation yielded active GbDIR2 and GhDIR3 in excellent purity. The described fermentation process in combination with enzymatic deglycosylation will pave the way for mechanistic and structural studies and, eventually, the application of cotton DIRs in a biomimetic approach towards atropselective biaryl synthesis.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and Characterization of a Novel Antifungal Exo-beta-1,3-glucanase from Chaetomium cupreum.</h4><p>C.

Its 1626-bp open reading frame encoded 541 amino acids. The corresponding amino acid sequence showed highest identity (67 %) with a glycoside hydrolase family 17 beta-1,3-glucanase from Chaetomium globosum. The recombinant protein Ccglu17A was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity with 10.1-fold purification and 47.8 % recovery yield. The protein's molecular mass was approximately 65 kDa, and its maximum activity appeared at pH 5.0 and temperature 45 degrees C. Heavy metal ions Fe2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ag+, and Hg2+ had inhibitory effects on Ccglu17A, but Ba2+ promoted the enzyme's activity. Ccglu17A exhibited high substrate specificity, almost exclusively catalyzing beta-1,3-glycosidic bond cleavage in various polysaccharoses to liberate glucose. The enzyme had a Km of 2.84 mg/mL and Vmax of 10.7 mumol glucose/min/mg protein for laminarin degradation under optimal conditions. Ccglu17A was an exoglucanase with transglycosylation activity based on its hydrolytic properties. It showed potential antifungal activity with a degradative effect on cell walls and inhibitory action against the germination of pathogenic fungus. In conclusion, Ccglu17A is the first functional exo-1,3-beta-glucanase to be identified from C. cupreum and has potential applicability in industry and agriculture.</p></details><hr><h4>Chicken IgY Fc Linked to Bordetella avium ompA and Taishan Pinus massoniana Pollen Polysaccharide Adjuvant Enhances Macrophage Function and Specific Immune Responses.</h4><p>W.

Mammalian IgG Fc fusion exhibits improved antigen-induced immune responses by providing aggregates with high avidity for the IgG Fc receptor and salvaging the antigenic portion from endosomal degradation. However, whether the linked chicken IgY Fc fragment shares similar characteristics to mammalian IgG Fc remains unclear. In this study, we linked the chicken IgY Fc gene to the outer membrane protein A (ompA) of Bordetella avium through overlapping PCR. The fusion gene was cloned into the pPIC9 plasmid to construct the recombinant Pichia pastoris transformant expressing the ompA-Fc fusion protein. The effects of the linked Fc on macrophage vitality, activity, efficiency of antigen processing, and immune responses induced by the fused ompA were investigated. Furthermore, the effect of Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), an immunomodulator, on chicken macrophage activation was evaluated. TPPPS was also used as an adjuvant to investigate its immunomodulatory effect on immunoresponses induced by the fused ompA-Fc in chickens. The pinocytosis, phagocytosis, secretion of nitric oxide and TNF-alpha, and MHC-II molecular expression of the macrophages treated with the fused ompA-Fc were significantly higher than those of the macrophages treated with ompA alone. The addition of TPPPS to the fused ompA-Fc further enhanced macrophage functions. The fused ompA-Fc elicited higher antigen-specific immune responses and protective efficacy compared with ompA alone. Moreover, the fused ompA-Fc conferred higher serum antibody titers, serum IL-2 and IL-4 concentrations, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte transformation rate, and protection rate compared with ompA alone. Notably, the prepared TPPPS adjuvant ompA-Fc vaccines induced high immune responses and protection rate. The linked Fc and TPPPS adjuvant can remarkably enhance macrophage functions and specific immune responses. This study provides new perspectives to improve the immune effects of subunit vaccines for prevention of poultry diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Matchout deuterium labelling of proteins for small-angle neutron scattering studies using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems and high cell-density cultures.</h4><p>O. Dunne et al., Eur Biophys J   (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27844110>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a powerful technique for the characterisation of macromolecular structures and interactions. Its main advantage over other solution state approaches is the ability to use D2O/H2O solvent contrast variation to selectively match out specific parts of a multi-component system. While proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids are readily distinguished in this way, it is not possible to locate different parts of a protein-protein system without the introduction of additional contrast by selective deuteration. Here, we describe new methods by which 'matchout labelled' proteins can be produced using Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris expression systems in high cell-density cultures. The method is designed to produce protein that has a scattering length density that is very close to that of 100% D2O, providing clear contrast when used with hydrogenated partner proteins in a complex. This allows the production of a single sample system for which SANS measurements at different solvent contrasts can be used to distinguish and model the hydrogenated component, the deuterated component, and the whole complex. The approach, which has significant cost advantages, has been extensively tested for both types of expression system.</p></details><hr><h4>A recombinant multi-antigen vaccine formulation containing Babesia bovis merozoite surface antigens MSA-2a1, MSA-2b and MSA-2c elicits invasion-inhibitory antibodies and IFN-gamma producing cells.</h4><p>A.

The vaccines currently available are based on attenuated parasites, which are difficult to produce, and are only recommended for use in bovines under one year of age. When used in older animals, these vaccines may cause life-threatening clinical symptoms and eventually death. The development of a multi-subunit recombinant vaccine against B. bovis would be attractive from an economic standpoint and, most importantly, could be recommended for animals of any age. In the present study, recombinant ectodomains of MSA-2a1, MSA-2b and MSA-2c antigens were expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast as secreted soluble peptides.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The antigens were purified to homogeneity, and biochemically and immunologically characterized. A vaccine formulation was obtained by emulsifying a mixture of the three peptides with the adjuvant Montanide ISA 720, which elicited high IgG antibody titers against each of the above antigens. IgG antibodies generated against each MSA-antigen recognized merozoites and significantly inhibited the invasion of bovine erythrocytes. Cellular immune responses were also detected, which were characterized by splenic and lymph node CD4+ T cells producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha upon stimulation with the antigens MSA-2a1 or MSA-2c.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> These data strongly suggest the high protective potential of the presented formulation, and we propose that it could be tested in vaccination trials of bovines challenged with B. bovis.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of construct design and fermentation strategy for the production of bioactive ATF-SAP, a saporin based anti-tumoral uPAR-targeted chimera.</h4><p>A.

We then moved the bioprocess to bioreactors and demonstrated that the fed-batch production of the recombinant protein can be successfully achieved, obtaining homogeneous discrete batches of the desired constructs. We also determined the cytotoxic activity of the obtained batch of ATF-SAP which was specifically cytotoxic for U937 leukemia cells, while another construct containing a catalytically inactive mutant form of SAP showed no activity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Our results demonstrate that the uPAR-targeted, saporin-based recombinant fusion ATF-SAP can be produced in a fed-batch fermentation with full retention of the molecules selective cytotoxicity and hence therapeutic potential.</p></details><hr><h4>Species Differences in Human and Rodent PEPT2-Mediated Transport of Glycylsarcosine and Cefadroxil in Pichia Pastoris Transformants.</h4><p>F.

However, unlike PEPT1 (SLC15A1), there is little information about species differences in the transport of PEPT2-mediated substrates. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PEPT2 exhibited a species-dependent uptake of glycylsarcosine (GlySar) and cefadroxil using yeast Pichia pastoris cells expressing cDNA from human, mouse, and rat. In such a system, the functional activity of PEPT2 was evaluated with [3H]GlySar as a function of time, pH, substrate concentration, and specificity, and with [3H]cefadroxil as a function of concentration. We observed that the uptake of GlySar was pH-dependent with an optimal uptake at pH 6.5 for all three species. Moreover, GlySar showed saturable uptake kinetics, with Km values in human (150.6 microM) > mouse (42.8 microM) approximately rat (36.0 microM). The PEPT2-mediated uptake of GlySar in yeast transformants was specific, being inhibited by di/tripeptides and peptide-like drugs, but not by amino acids and nonsubstrate compounds. Cefadroxil also showed a saturable uptake profile in all three species, with Km values in human (150.8 muM) > mouse (15.6 muM) approximately rat (11.9 muM). These findings demonstrated that the PEPT2-mediated uptake of GlySar and cefadroxil was specific, species dependent, and saturable. Furthermore, based on the Km values, mice appeared similar to rats but both were less than optimal as animal models in evaluating the renal reabsorption and pharmacokinetics of peptides and peptide-like drugs in humans.</p></details><hr><h4>cDNA Isolation and Functional Characterization of UDP-d-glucuronic Acid 4-Epimerase Family from Ornithogalum caudatum.</h4><p>S.

The incorporation of GalA into these polysaccharides from UDP-d-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA) was reasonably known. However, the cDNAs involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-GalA were still unknown. In the present investigation, one candidate UDP-d-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase (UGlcAE) family with three members was isolated from O. caudatum based on RNA-Seq data. Bioinformatics analyses indicated all of the three isoforms, designated as OcUGlcAE1~3, were members of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) and shared two conserved motifs. The three full-length cDNAs were then transformed to Pichia pastoris GS115 for heterologous expression. Data revealed both the supernatant and microsomal fractions from the recombinant P. pastoris expressing OcUGlcAE3 can interconvert UDP-GalA and UDP-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), while the other two OcUGlcAEs had no activity on UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalA. Furthermore, expression analyses of the three epimerases in varied tissues of O. caudatum were performed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results indicated OcUGlcAE3, together with the other two OcUGlcAE-like genes, was root-specific, displaying highest expression in roots. OcUGlcAE3 was UDP-d-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase and thus deemed to be involved in the biosynthesis of root polysaccharides. Moreover, OcUGlcAE3 was proposed to be environmentally induced.</p></details><hr><h4>Neutralization of TNFalpha in tumor with a novel nanobody potentiates paclitaxel-therapy and inhibits metastasis in breast cancer.</h4><p>X.

Researchers have suggested that inflammatory factors in the tumor environment can promote cancer invasion and metastasis, stimulating cancer progression. Thus, novel strategies that target cytokines and modulate the tumor microenvironment may emerge as important approaches for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specific neutralization of pathogenic TNF signaling using a TNFalpha antibody has gained increasing attention. Considering this, a selective human TNFalpha neutralized antibody was generated based on nanobody technology. A TNFalpha-specific nanobody was produced in Pichia pastoris with a molecular mass of 15 kDa and affinity constant of 2.05 nM. In the proliferation experiment, the TNFalpha nanobody could inhibit the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 induced by hTNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. In the microinvasion model, the TNFalpha nanobody could inhibit the migration of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 induced by hTNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. Drug administration of the combination of paclitaxel with the TNFalpha nanobody in vivo significantly enhanced the efficacy against 4T-1 breast tumor proliferation and lung metastasis; meanwhile, E-cadherin tumor epithelial marker expression was upregulated, supporting the anti-tumor therapeutic relevance of paclitaxel and the TNFalpha nanobody on EMT. This study highlights the importance of neutralizing low TNFalpha levels in the tumor microenvironment to sensitize the chemotherapeutic response, which has attractive potential for clinical applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimization of the fermentation and downstream processes for human enterokinase production in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

In this study, several fermentation strategies were assayed for the production of human enterokinase in Pichia pastoris under constitutive GAP promoter. Two of them with controlled specific growth rate during whole cultivation showed a very low enterokinase activity, under 1 U/ml, of the fermentation medium. On the contrary, the combined fermentation with a maximum specific growth rate at the initial phase of the fermentation and stationary-like phase during the rest of the fermentation showed a significant accumulation of the enterokinase in the medium, which counted up to 1400 U/ml. Lower cultivation temperature had a negative impact on the enzyme accumulation during this fermentation strategy. Downstream processes were focused on buffer environment optimization directly after cultivation, as at this time, the most amount of the activity is eliminated by endogenous proteases. Slightly positive effect on enzyme activity in the medium had an addition of liquid storage solution of EDTA and KOH to adjust pH to 8 and molarity of the EDTA to 50 mM. During the purification process, a significant amount of the enzyme was detected to be lost, which counted up to 90%. The purified enzyme, enterokinase, kept quality standard of the published enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of a ZEN-detoxifying gene by codon optimization and biobrick in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>Xiang et al., Microbiol Res 193 48 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27825486>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) can be degraded by a lactone hydrolase ZHD, which was derived from Gliocladium roseum. Here, based on the native ZHD encoding gene zhd101, a codon optimized zhd gene was synthesized, which was used for high expression of ZHD in Pichia pastoris GS115. Meanwhile, to further improve the expression of recombinant ZHD, the plasmids containing 1 to 4 copies of the zhd expression cassette were constructed, respectively, using the biobrick method. The protein expression in the recombinant P. pastoris X3c, which was transformed with the plasmid containing 3 copies of zhd expression cassette, was the highest. In addition, the enzymatic activity of ZHD against ZEN was defined for the first time based on a standard curve of peak area vs ZEN concentration. The ZEN degradation activity of ZHD from shake flask fermentation was calculated as 22.5U/mL with the specific activity of 4976.5U/mg. Furthermore, the high-density fermentation of P. pastoris X3c strain was also performed in 5L fermenter. The maximum enzyme activity of the supernatant was 150.1U/mL, which were 6.7-fold higher than that of the shake flask fermentation.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant Dengue Virus 4 Envelope Glycoprotein Virus-Like Particles Derived from Pichia pastoris are Capable of Eliciting Homotypic Domain III-Directed Neutralizing Antibodies.</h4><p>N.

An efficacious tetravalent vaccine, which can provide long-term immunity against all four serotypes in all target populations, is still unavailable. Despite the progress being made in the live virus-based dengue vaccines, the World Health Organization strongly recommends the development of alternative approaches for safe, affordable, and efficacious dengue vaccine candidates. We have explored virus-like particles (VLPs)-based nonreplicating subunit vaccine approach and have developed recombinant envelope ectodomains of DENV-1, 2, and 3 expressed in Pichia pastoris These self-assembled into VLPs without pre-membrane (prM) protein, which limits the generation of enhancing antibodies, and elicited type-specific neutralizing antibodies against the respective serotype. Encouraged by these results, we have extended this work further by developing P. pastoris-expressed DENV-4 ectodomain (DENV-4 E) in this study, which was found to be glycosylated and assembled into spherical VLPs without prM, and displayed critical neutralizing epitopes on its surface. These VLPs were found to be immunogenic in mice and elicited DENV-4-specific neutralizing antibodies, which were predominantly directed against envelope domain III, implicated in host-receptor recognition and virus entry. These observations underscore the potential of VLP-based nonreplicative vaccine approach as a means to develop a safe, efficacious, and tetravalent dengue subunit vaccine. This work paves the way for the evaluation of a DENV E-based tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, as an alternative to live virus-based dengue vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhancing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor expression in Pichia pastoris through fusion with human serum albumin.</h4><p>M.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a hematopoietic growth factor and is clinically used against neutropenia. Enhanced expression and stability of G-CSF were achieved in Pichia pastoris by the way of constructing a fusion protein with human serum albumin (HSA). The strategy involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fragments corresponding to codon-optimized G-CSF and domain 3 of HSA. Overlapping PCR was used to obtain the full-length fused gene (1,184 bp) with a 15-bp linker sequence comprising of 4 Gly and 1 Ser residues. Extracellular expression was carried out downstream of alpha-factor secretion signal sequence under the control of alcohol oxidase 1 promoter using pPICZalphaB. Excreted protein in the range of 110-380 mg L-1 was observed among the transformants. Effect of aeration and temperature was investigated in one of the transformants (35) overexpressing fusion protein and levels of G-CSF enhanced by 1.8-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively. Assay of biological activity indicated the fusion protein to retain similar cell proliferation activity as the commercial G-CSF preparation.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of a biologically active staphylokinase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H.

SAK variant of SAKsmall ef, CyrillicC was expressed in Pichia pastoris strains KM71H and GS115. The codon adaptation index of SAK was improved from 0.75 to 0.89. The expression of recombinant SAK (rSAK) reached to its maximum (310 mg/L of the culture medium) after 48-hr stimulation with 3% methanol and remained steady until day 5. The maximum activity of the enzyme was at pH 8.6 and 37 degrees C. It was highly active at temperatures 20-37 degrees C and pH ranges of 6.8-9 (relative residual activity more than 80%). It was determined that rSAK was 73.8% of the total proteins secreted by P. pastoris KM71H into the culture media. The specific activities of rSAK were measured as 9,002 and 21,042 U/mg for the nonpurified and purified proteins, respectively. The quantity of the purified protein (>99% purity) was 720 microg/mL with a purification factor of 2.34. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 22 and 18.6 kDa. It was concluded that P. pastoris is a proper host for expression of biologically active and endotoxin-free rSAK due to its high expression and low protein impurity in culture supernatant.</p></details><hr><h4>Is Pichia pastoris a realistic platform for industrial production of recombinant human interferon gamma?</h4><p>A.

Efficient expression of hIFNgamma has been reported once for Pichia pastoris (Wang et al., 2014) - a proven heterologous expression system. This study investigated hIFNgamma expression in P. pastoris replicating the previous study and expanding by using four different strains (X33: wild type; GS115: HIS-Mut+; KM71</p><p><strong>H:</strong> Arg+, Mut- and CBS7435: MutS) and three different vectors (pPICZalphaA, pPIC9 and pPpT4alphaS). In addition, the native sequence (NS) and two codon-optimised sequences (COS1 and COS2) for P. pastoris were used. Methanol induction yielded no expression/secretion of hIFNgamma in X33, highest levels were recorded for CBS7435: MutS ( approximately 16 mug. L-1). mRNA copy number calculations acquired from RT-qPCR for GS115-pPIC9-COS1 proved low abundance of mRNA. A 10-fold increase in expression of hIFNgamma was achieved by lowering the minimal free energy of the mRNA and 100-fold by MutS phenotypes, substantially lower than reported by Wang et al. (2014). We conclude that commercial production of low cost, eukaryotic recombinant hIFNgamma is not an economically viable in P. pastoris. Further research is required to unravel the cause of low expression in P. pastoris to achieve economic viability.</p></details><hr><h4>Lectin I from Bauhinia variegata (BVL-I) expressed by Pichia pastoris inhibits initial adhesion of oral bacteria in vitro.</h4><p>G.

Bauhinia variegata lectin I (BVL-I) is a Gal/GalNAc-specific, single-chain lectin isolated from Bauhinia variegata seeds that has been implicated in the inhibition of bacterial adhesion and the healing of damaged skin. Since the source of the native protein (nBVL) is limited, this study aimed to produce recombinant BVL-I in Pichia pastoris (rBVL-Ip). The coding sequence for BVL-I containing preferential codons for P. pastoris was cloned into the pPICZalphaB plasmid. A single expressing clone was selected and fermented, resulting in the secretion and glycosylation of the protein. Fed-batch fermentation in 7L-scale was performed, and the recombinant lectin was purified from culture supernatant, resulting in a yield of 1.5mg/L culture. Further, rBVL-Ip was compared to nBVL and its recombinant version expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (rBVL-Ie). Although it was expressed as a monomer, rBVL-Ip retained its biological activity since it was able to impair the initial adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguinis in an in vitro model of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion. In summary, rBVL-Ip produced in Pichia pastoris represents a viable alternative to large-scale production, encouraging further biological application studies with this lectin.</p></details><hr><h4>An Acid-Adapted Endo-alpha-1,5-L-arabinanase for Pectin Releasing.</h4><p>C.

Y702 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme was named AbnC702 with 20 U/mg of endo-arabinanase activity toward linear alpha-1,5-L-arabinan. The optimal pH and temperature of AbnC702 were 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The recombinant AbnC702 was highly stable at pH 5.0-7.0 and 50 degrees C. It could retain about 72.3 % of maximum specific activity at pH 5.0 after incubation for 2.5 h, which indicated AbnC702 was an acid-adapted enzyme. The K m and V max values were 24.8 +/- 4.7 mg/ml and 88.5 +/- 5.6 U/mg, respectively. A three-dimensional structure of AbnC702 was made by homology modeling, and the counting of acidic/basic amino residues within the region of 10 A around the active site, as well the hydrogen bonds within the area of 5 A around the active site, might theoretically interpret the acid adaptability of AbnC702. Analysis of hydrolysis products by thin layer chromatography (TLC) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) verified that the recombinant AbnC702 was an endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinanase, which yielded arabinobiose and arabinotriose as major products. AbnC702 was applied in pectin extraction from apple pomace with synergistic action of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase.</p></details><hr><h4>Overcoming difficulties on synthesis of cardiac troponin-I.</h4><p>S.

To produce the protein efficiently, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris systems were used. Initial trials for the expression in E. coli were not successful, although different expression vectors with different promoters were tested. This led us to use P. pastoris for the expression. After several trials with two different expression strains of P. pastoris, it was concluded that P. pastoris was also not an optimal expression host for cTnI. Comprehensive analysis of the expression systems indicated that an efficient expression is only possible when the gene is optimized for expression in E. coli. For this purpose, the gene was optimized in-silico, but edited manually afterwards. It was synthesized and cloned into pQE-2 vector. Expression was performed using routine experimental conditions. Thus, cTnI could be efficiently expressed from the optimized gene in E. coli. The expression and purification were practical and may be used for commercial purposes since a total yield of 25microg highly pure protein per milliliter of culture could be obtained. The protein was in its ready-to-use form for many biological applications, including as a standard in diagnostic tests and an antigen for antibody production.</p></details><hr><h4>Regulating unfolded protein response activator HAC1p for production of thermostable raw-starch hydrolyzing alpha-amylase in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Huang et al., Bioprocess Biosyst Eng 40 341 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27796570>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Unfolded protein response (UPR) usually happens when expressing heterologous proteins in high level, which may help cells to facilitate protein processing. Here, we evaluated the effects of the UPR activator HAC1p on a raw-starch hydrolyzing alpha-amylase (Gs4j-amyA), so as to improve heterologous production of the enzyme in Pichia pastoris. The gene (amyA) encoding Gs4j-amyA was first codon-optimized and expressed in P. pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. A high gene dosage (12 copies) of amyA facilitated amylase expression which produced an enzyme activity of 305 U/ml. A spliced HAC1 encoding an UPR activator HAC1p was then co-expressed and the dosage effects of HAC1 on amylase expression was investigated. Six copies of HAC1 driven by AOX1 promoter produced a high amylase activity of 2200 U/ml, further increasing by 621%. However, excessive gene dosages driven by the same promoter led to a titration effect of its transcription factors and decreased the amount of amyA transcripts. Thus, constitutive expression of HAC1 by GAP promotor was further involved and Gs4j-amyA activity reached 3700 U/ml finally, which was further increased by 68.2%. Moreover, Gs4j-amyA was glycosylated in P. pastoris which generated higher enzyme activity than that in E. coli. Generally, regulating HAC1p expression by different strategies enhanced amylase production by 11.1 folds, indicating a reference for expression of other proteins in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant exochitinase of the thermophilic mould Myceliopthora thermophila BJA: Characteristics and utility in generating N-acetyl glucosamine and in biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi.</h4><p>A.

To produce high enzyme titres, reduce fermentation time and overcome the need for induction, this enzyme has been heterologously expressed under GAP promoter in the GRAS yeast, Pichia pastoris. The production medium supplemented with the permeabilizing agent Tween-20 supported two-fold higher rMtChit production (5.5 x 103 U L-1 ). The consensus sequences S(132)xG(133)G(134) and D(168)xxD(171)xD(173)xE(175) in the enzyme have been found to represent the substrate binding and catalytic sites, respectively. The rMtChit, purified to homogeneity by a two-step purification strategy, is a monomeric glycoprotein of approximately 48 kDa, which is optimally active at 55 degrees C and pH 5.0. The enzyme is thermostable with t1/2 values of 113 and 48 min at 65 and 75 degrees C, respectively. Kinetic parameters Km , Vmax , kcat , and kcat /Km of the enzyme are 4.655 mg mL-1 , 34.246 nmol mg-1 s-1 , 3.425 x 106 min-1 , and 1.36 x 10-6 mg mL-1 min-1 , respectively. rMtChit is an unique exochitinase, since its action on chitin liberates N-acetylglucosamine NAG. The enzyme inhibits the growth of phytopathogenic fungi like Fusarium oxysporum and Curvularia lunata, therefore, this finds application as biofungicide at high temperatures during summer in tropics.

A total of 150,000 U/L of Ba-amy were attained under constitutive promoter in P. pastoris, which is 15-fold higher than that of the wild strain B. acidicola (10,000 U/L). The recombinant P. pastoris integrated two copies of Ba-amy under GAP promoter. The pure Ba-amy expressed in P. pastoris is a glycoprotein of 66 kDa, which is optimally active at pH 4.0 and 60 degrees C with a T 1/2 of 25 min at 70 degrees C. The K m, V max and K cat values of the recombinant Ba-amy are 1.66 mg/mL, 53.6 micromol/mg/min and 106.8/s, respectively. The enzyme generates maltose (30 %), maltotriose (20 %) and other higher maltooligosaccharides from starch, thus, useful in baking as an antistale.

To check the influence of the expression on interfacial properties of FSL and to study kinetic properties of FSL2, interfacial parameters of FSL2, native FSL, untagged recombinant and tagged recombinant forms of FSL were compared using the monomolecular film technique. Kinetic study on the dependence of the stereoselectivity of these lipases on the surface pressure was performed using three dicaprin isomers spread in the form of monomolecular films at the air-water interface. The FSL2 seems to have an important penetration power with a preference for adjacent ester groups and the heterologous expression accompanied or not with the N-His-tag extension on the FSL were found to modify the pressure preference and increase the catalytic hydrolysis rate of three dicaprin isomers. The heterologous expression was found to preserve the FSL regioselectivity without affecting its stereospecificity at high and low surface pressure. The evaluation of the recombinant expression Effects on Catalysis (REC), the N-Tag Effects on Catalysis (TEC), and the N-Tag and Recombinant expression Effects on Catalysis (TREC) showed that the heterologous expression was more efficient than the presence of the N-terminal tag extension on the FSL.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression, purification and antimicrobial activity of a novel antimicrobial peptide PaDef in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

In this study, an N-terminal 6 x His tagged recombinant PaDef (rPaDef) with a molecular weight of 7.5 KDa, for the first time, was expressed as a secreted peptide in Pichia pastoris. The optimal culture condition for rPaDef expression was determined to be incubation with 1.5% methanol for 72 h at 28 degrees C under pH 6.0. Under this condition, the amount of the rPaDef accumulation reached as high as 79.6 mug per 1 ml of culture medium. Once the rPaDef peptide was purified to reach a 95.7% purity using one-step nickel affinity chromatography, its strong and concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity was detected to be against a broad-spectrum of bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The growth of these bacterial pathogens was almost completely inhibited when the rPaDef peptide was at a concentration of as low as 90 mug/ml. In summary, our data showed that rPaDef derived from Mexican avocado fruit can be expressed and secreted efficiently when P. pastoris was used as a cell factory. This is the first report on heterologous expression of PaDef in P. pastoris and the approach described holds great promise for antibacterial drug development.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of the catalytic performance of a hyperthermostable GH10 xylanase from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802.</h4><p>X.

Purified recombinant TlXyn10A was acidic and hyperthermophilic, and retained stable over the pH range of 2.0-6.0 and at 90 degrees C. Sequence analysis of TlXyn10A identified seven residues probably involved in substrate contacting. Three mutants (TlXyn10A_P, _N and _C) were then constructed by substituting some or all of the residues with corresponding ones of hyperthermal Xyl10C from Bispora sp. MEY-1. TlXyn10A_P with mutations at subsites +2 to +4 exhibited improved specific activity (by 0.44-fold) and pH stability (2.0-10.0). Molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that mutations E229I and F232E probably weaken the substrate affinity at subsites +3 to +4, and G149D may introduce a new hydrogen bond. These modifications altogether account for the improved performance of TlXyn10A_P. Moreover, TlXyn10A_P was able to hydrolyze wheat straw persistently, and has the application potentials in various industries.</p></details><hr><h4>Bioprocess for the production of recombinant HAP phytase of the thermophilic mold Sporotrichum thermophile and its structural and biochemical characteristics.</h4><p>A.

Low extracellular phytase production by the mold is a major bottleneck for its application on a commercial scale. We have successfully overcome this problem by constitutive secretary expression of codon optimized rStPhy under glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter in Pichia pastoris. A approximately 41-fold improvement in rStPhy production has been achieved. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra revealed that rStPhy is composed of 26.65% alpha-helices, 5.26% beta-sheets and 68.09% random coils at pH 5.0 and 60 degrees C, the optima for the enzyme activity. The melting temperature (Tm) of the enzyme is approximately 73 degrees C. The 3D structure of rStPhy displayed characteristic signature sequences (RHGXRXP and HD) of HAP phytase. The catalytically important amino acids (Arg74, His75, Arg78, His368 and Asp369) were identified by docking and site directed mutagenesis. Fluorescence quenching by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CsCl exposed tryptophan residues surrounded by negative charges, which play a key role in maintaining structural integrity of rStPhy.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory expression of bovine herpesvirus type 1/5 glycoprotein E in Pichia pastoris for the differential diagnosis of vaccinated or infected cattle.</h4><p>B.

In this study a codon optimized synthetic sequence of gE containing highly conserved regions from BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 was expressed in Pichia pastoris. Following expression, the recombinant gE (rgE) was secreted and purified from the culture medium. The rgE was identified by Western blotting (WB) using sera from cattle naturally infected with BoHV-1 and/or BoHV-5, or sera from bovines experimentally infected with wild-type BoHV-5. Sera collected from cattle vaccinated with a BoHV-5 gI/gE/US9 marker vaccine failed to recognise rgE. Expression of rgE, based on a sequence containing highly conserved regions from BoHV-1 and BoHV-5, in P. pastoris enabled the production of large quantities of rgE suitable for use in immunoassays for the differentiation vaccinated or infected cattle.</p></details><hr><h4>Selective Assembly of Na,K-ATPase alpha2beta2 Heterodimers in the Heart: DISTINCT FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES AND ISOFORM-SELECTIVE INHIBITORS.</h4><p>M.

The beta subunit differentially regulates maturation, trafficking, and activity of alpha-beta heterodimers. It is not known whether the distinct role of alpha2 in the heart is related to selective assembly with a particular one of the three beta isoforms. We show here by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation that alpha2 is preferentially expressed with beta2 in T-tubules of cardiac myocytes, forming alpha2beta2 heterodimers. We have expressed human alpha1beta1, alpha2beta1, alpha2beta2, and alpha2beta3 in Pichia pastoris, purified the complexes, and compared their functional properties. alpha2beta2 and alpha2beta3 differ significantly from both alpha2beta1 and alpha1beta1 in having a higher K0.5K+ and lower K0.5Na+ for activating Na,K-ATPase. These features are the result of a large reduction in binding affinity for extracellular K+ and shift of the E1P-E2P conformational equilibrium toward E1P. A screen of perhydro-1,4-oxazepine derivatives of digoxin identified several derivatives (e.g. cyclobutyl) with strongly increased selectivity for inhibition of alpha2beta2 and alpha2beta3 over alpha1beta1 (range 22-33-fold). Molecular modeling suggests a possible basis for isoform selectivity. The preferential assembly, specific T-tubular localization, and low K+ affinity of alpha2beta2 could allow an acute response to raised ambient K+ concentrations in physiological conditions and explain the importance of alpha2beta2 for cardiac muscle contractility. The high sensitivity of alpha2beta2 to digoxin derivatives explains beneficial effects of cardiac glycosides for treatment of heart failure and potential of alpha2beta2-selective digoxin derivatives for reducing cardiotoxicity.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient heterologous expression of Fusarium solani lipase, FSL2, in Pichia pastoris, functional characterization of the recombinant enzyme and molecular modeling.</h4><p>R.

Based on sequence similarity with other fungal lipases, FSL2 contains a catalytic triad, consisting of Ser144, Asp198, and His256. FSL2 cDNA was subcloned into the pGAPZalphaA vector containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor signal sequence and this construct was used to transform Pichia pastoris and achieve a high-level extracellular production of a FSL2 lipase. Maximum lipase activity was observed after 48h. The optimum activity of the purified recombinant enzyme was measured at pH 8.0-9.0 and 37 degrees C. FSL2 is remarkably stable at alkaline pH values up to 12 and at temperatures below 40 degrees C. It has high catalytic efficiency towards triglycerides with short to long chain fatty acids but with a marked preference for medium and long chain fatty acids. FSL2 activity is decreased at sodium taurodeoxycholate concentrations above the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of this anionic detergent. However, lipase activity is enhanced by Ca2+ and inhibited by EDTA or Cu2+ and partially by Mg2+ or K+. In silico docking of medium chain triglycerides, monogalctolipids (MGDG), digalactolipids (DGDG) and long chain phospholipids in the active site of FSL2 reveals structural solutions.</p></details><hr><h4>A Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase with Broad Xyloglucan Specificity from the Brown-Rot Fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum and Its Action on Cellulose-Xyloglucan Complexes.</h4><p>Y. Kojima et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 82 6557 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590806>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Fungi secrete a set of glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) to degrade plant polysaccharides. Brown-rot fungi, such as Gloeophyllum trabeum, tend to have few LPMOs, and information on these enzymes is scarce. The genome of G. trabeum encodes four auxiliary activity 9 (AA9) LPMOs (GtLPMO9s), whose coding sequences were amplified from cDNA. Due to alternative splicing, two variants of GtLPMO9A seem to be produced, a single-domain variant, GtLPMO9A-1, and a longer variant, GtLPMO9A-2, which contains a C-terminal domain comprising approximately 55 residues without a predicted function. We have overexpressed the phylogenetically distinct GtLPMO9A-2 in Pichia pastoris and investigated its properties. Standard analyses using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and mass spectrometry (MS) showed that GtLPMO9A-2 is active on cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xyloglucan. Importantly, compared to other known xyloglucan-active LPMOs, GtLPMO9A-2 has broad specificity, cleaving at any position along the beta-glucan backbone of xyloglucan, regardless of substitutions. Using dynamic viscosity measurements to compare the hemicellulolytic action of GtLPMO9A-2 to that of a well-characterized hemicellulolytic LPMO, NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa revealed that GtLPMO9A-2 is more efficient in depolymerizing xyloglucan. These measurements also revealed minor activity on glucomannan that could not be detected by the analysis of soluble products by HPAEC-PAD and MS and that was lower than the activity of NcLPMO9C. Experiments with copolymeric substrates showed an inhibitory effect of hemicellulose coating on cellulolytic LPMO activity and did not reveal additional activities of GtLPMO9A-2. These results provide insight into the LPMO potential of G. trabeum and provide a novel sensitive method, a measurement of dynamic viscosity, for monitoring LPMO activity.</p><p><strong> IMPORTANCE:</strong> Currently, there are only a few methods available to analyze end products of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) activity, the most common ones being liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Here, we present an alternative and sensitive method based on measurement of dynamic viscosity for real-time continuous monitoring of LPMO activity in the presence of water-soluble hemicelluloses, such as xyloglucan. We have used both these novel and existing analytical methods to characterize a xyloglucan-active LPMO from a brown-rot fungus. This enzyme, GtLPMO9A-2, differs from previously characterized LPMOs in having broad substrate specificity, enabling almost random cleavage of the xyloglucan backbone. GtLPMO9A-2 acts preferentially on free xyloglucan, suggesting a preference for xyloglucan chains that tether cellulose fibers together. The xyloglucan-degrading potential of GtLPMO9A-2 suggests a role in decreasing wood strength at the initial stage of brown rot through degradation of the primary cell wall.</p></details><hr><h4>Nanofibrillar hydrogel scaffolds from recombinant protein-based polymers with integrin- and proteoglycan-binding domains.</h4><p>M. K.

With a view to bone tissue engineering applications, we equipped these variants with N-terminal extensions containing either (1) integrin-binding (RGD) or (2) less commonly studied proteoglycan-binding (KRSR) cell-adhesive motifs. The polymers were efficiently produced as secreted proteins using the yeast Pichia pastoris and were essentially monodisperse. The pH-responsive protein-based polymers are soluble at low pH and self-assemble into supramolecular fibrils and hydrogels at physiological pH. By mixing functionalized and nonfunctionalized proteins in different ratios, and adjusting pH, hydrogel scaffolds with the same protein concentration but varying content of the two types of cell-adhesive motifs were readily obtained. The scaffolds were used for the two-dimensional culture of MG-63 osteoblastic cells. RGD domains had a slightly stronger effect than KRSR domains on adhesion, activity, and spreading. However, scaffolds featuring both functional domains revealed a clear synergistic effect on cell metabolic activity and spreading, and provided the highest final degree of cell confluency. The mixed functionalized hydrogels presented here thus allowed to tailor the osteoblastic cell response, offering prospects for their further development as scaffolds for bone regeneration.

Landes et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 113 2633 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27345605>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is widely used for production of recombinant proteins. Here we characterize a vitamin-sensitive regulatory sequence, which can be controlled independently of the main culture medium compounds such as carbon, nitrogen, or phosphor source. The THI11 promoter (PTHI11 ) sequence derives from a gene involved in biosynthesis of thiamine. For characterization, a P. pastoris strain expressing recombinant human serum albumin under control of PTHI11 was grown in the controlled environment of a bioreactor. The thiamine sensitivity of PTHI11 was proven and specified in batch cultures containing different amounts of extracellular thiamine. Under non-repressing conditions PTHI11 offers a constitutive expression pattern with growth rate dependent product formation. Furthermore, promoter activity and thus product formation can be repressed for a desired period of time by supplementing the culture with a pre-defined amount of exogenous thiamine. Once a threshold of biomass is reached, PTHI11 driven expression starts autonomously without external intervention. Based on these findings a tailor-made process strategy was developed and experimentally verified. Additionally, we compared the THI11 promoter with the commonly used GAP promoter. In conclusion, the THI11 promoter is a versatile and easy to control regulatory sequence which enables the realization of novel protein production strategies. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 2633-2643.

All genes were found to be functional after heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. One of them, LIP09, showed high-level expression in Pichia pastoris with the yield of 2.0 g/L in a 3.7-L fermentor. Deduced amino acid sequence of LIP09 consists of a putative signal peptide (residues 1-19) and a mature polypeptide (residues 20-562). Compared with other fungal counterparts, purified recombinant LIP09 has some superior properties. It exhibited maximum activity at 60 degrees C and pH 5.0, had broad pH adaptability (>60% activity at pH 3.5-8.0) and stability (retaining >90% activity after incubation at pH 3.0-7.0 for 1 h at 40 degrees C), and was highly thermostable (retaining >96% activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for 30 min). The r-LIP09 had a preference for the medium-chain length p-nitrophenyl esters (C12) rather than short and long-chain length substrates. The high-level expression and excellent properties make LIP09 a potential enzyme candidate in food and feed industries.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression and biochemical characterization of a novel cold-active lipase from Rhizomucor endophyticus.</h4><p>X.

The recombinant lipase (RelipB) was purified and biochemically characterized. ReLipB was most active at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C. It was stable from pH 4.5-9.0. It exhibited broad substrate specificity towards p-nitrophenyl (pNP) esters (C2-C16) and triacylglycerols (C2-C12), showing the highest specific activities towards pNP laurate (231 U/mg) and tricaprylin (1840 U/mg), respectively.

Only 3 U/ml was obtained with the wild type sequence while the sequence optimized using both ICU and CC objectives showed intermediate performance of 10 U/ml. These results clearly show that CC is the most relevant parameter for the codon optimization of MFLS in P. pastoris, and there is no synergistic effect achieved by considering both ICU and CC together.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> The CC optimized MFLS increased secretory protein production of CAL-B in P. pastoris by fourfold.</p></details><hr><h4>Cross-Linking and Bundling of Self-Assembled Protein-Based Polymer Fibrils via Heterodimeric Coiled Coils.</h4><p>N.

We here demonstrate that the structure of these hydrogels can be tuned via heterodimeric coiled coils that cross-link and bundle the self-assembled protein polymer fibrils. We fused well-characterized, 47 amino acids-long heterodimeric coiled coil "linkers" (DA or DB) to the C-terminus of the triblock polymer. The resulting C2-SH48-C2-DA and C2-SH48-C2-DB polymers, were successfully produced as secreted proteins in Pichia pastoris, with titers of purified protein in the order of g L-1 of clarified broth. Atomic force microscopy showed that fibrils formed by either C2-SH48-C2-DA or C2-SH48-C2-DB alone already displayed extensive bundling, apparently as a result of homotypic (DA/DA and DB/DB) interactions. For fibrils prepared from protein polymers having no linkers, plus a small fraction of polymers containing either DA or DB linkers, no cross-linking and bundling was observed. At these same low concentrations of linkers, fibrils containing both the DA and the DB linkers did show cross-linking and bundling as a consequence of heterodimer formation. This work shows that we can control the extent of bundling and cross-linking of supramolecular fibrils by varying the density of heterodimerizing coiled coils in the fibrils, which is promising for the further development of materials that mimic the extracellular matrix.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel enzyme-Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase (SBLE)-responsible for sophorolipid lactonization.</h4><p>K. Ciesielska et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 100 9529 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251547>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We recently discovered a novel enzyme in the exoproteome of Starmerella bombicola, which is structurally related to Candida antarctica lipase A. A knockout strain for this enzyme does no longer produce lactonic sophorolipids, prompting us to believe that this protein is the missing S. bombicola lactone esterase (SBLE). SBLE catalyzes a rather unusual reaction, i.e., an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of acidic sophorolipids in an aqueous environment, which raised questions about its activity and mode of action. Here, we report the heterologous production of this enzyme in Pichia pastoris and its purification in a two-step strategy. Purified recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) was used to perform HPLC and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based assays with different sophorolipid mixtures. We experimentally confirmed that SBLE is able to perform ring closure of acetylated acidic sophorolipids. This substrate was selected for rSBLE kinetic studies to estimate the apparent values of K m . We established that rSBLE displays optimal activity in the pH range of 3.5 to 6 and has an optimal temperature in the range of 20 to 50 degrees C. Additionally, we generated a rSBLE mutant through site-directed mutagenesis of Ser194 in the predicted active site pocket and show that this mutant is lacking the ability to lactonize sophorolipids. We therefore propose that SBLE operates via the common serine hydrolase mechanism in which the catalytic serine residue is assisted by a His/Asp pair.</p></details><hr><h4>Genome mining and motif truncation of glycoside hydrolase family 5 endo-beta-1,4-mannanase encoded by Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 for potential konjac flour hydrolysis or feed additive.</h4><p>C.

The AoMan5A contains a predicted family 1 carbohydrate binding module (CBM-1), located at its N-terminal. The AoMan5A, AoMan5B and truncated mutant AoMan5ADeltaCL (truncating the N-terminal CBM and linker of AoMan5A) were expressed retaining the N-terminus of the native protein in Pichia pastoris GS115 by pPIC9KM. The specific enzyme activity of the purified reAoMan5A, reAoMan5B and reAoMan5ADeltaCL towards locust bean gum at pH 3.6 and 40 degrees C for 10min, was 8.3, 104.2 and 15.8U/mg, respectively. The temperature properties of the reAoMan5ADeltaCL were improved by truncating CBM. They can degrade the pretreated konjac flour and produce prebiotics. In addition, they had excellent stability under simulative gastric fluid and simulative prilling process. All these properties make these recombinant beta-mannanases potential additives for use in the food and feed industries.</p></details><hr><h4>AoAtg26, a putative sterol glucosyltransferase, is required for autophagic degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.</h4><p>T.

In filamentous fungi, autophagic degradation of organelles such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei occurs in basal cells after the prolonged culture, but its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we functionally analyzed the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae AoAtg26, an ortholog of the sterol glucosyltransferase PpAtg26 involved in pexophagy in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Deletion of Aoatg26 caused a severe decrease in conidiation and aerial hyphae formation, which is typically observed in the autophagy-deficient A. oryzae strains. In addition, cup-shaped AoAtg8-positive membrane structures were accumulated in the Aoatg26 deletion strain, indicating that autophagic process is impaired. Indeed, the Aoatg26 deletion strain was defective in the degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei. Taken together, AoAtg26 plays an important role for autophagic degradation of organelles in A. oryzae, which may physiologically contribute to the differentiation in filamentous fungi.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of l-glutamate oxidase in Pichia pastoris using multi-copy expression strains and high cell density cultivation.</h4><p>W.

In the present study, Pichia pastoris was used for heterologous production of GLOD following optimization of the gox coding sequence for expression in the yeast host. A series of constructs based on the pHBM905BDM plasmid were engineered and transformed into P. pastoris to increase the gox copy number. The results indicated that GLOD protein levels and enzyme activity increased with increasing gox copy number. Strain PGLOD4, which contained four copies of the target gene, was chosen for subsequent fermentation experiments, and a fermentation strategy involving two exponential feeding phases was developed. During the preinduction phase, glycerol was fed exponentially at muG = 0.15/h. When the cell density reached 300 g/l, methanol was fed exponentially at muM = 0.03/h to induce GLOD production. After 84 h of cultivation, the final cell density and total enzyme activity reached 420 g/L and 247.8 U/mL, respectively. The recombinant enzyme displayed an optimum temperature of 40 degrees C, which was higher than recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli. This is important because increasing the temperature could accelerate enzymatic transformation of l-glutamic acid to alpha-KG. Experiments also demonstrated superior thermo-stability for the enzyme produced in yeast, which further enhances its potential for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhanced detoxification and degradation of herbicide atrazine by a group of O-methyltransferases in rice.</h4><p>Y.

Lu et al., Chemosphere 165 487 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27677124>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Atrazine (ATR) as a toxic herbicide has become one of the seriously environmental contaminants worldwide due to its long-term intensive use in crop production. This study identified novel methyltransferases (MTs) involved in detoxification and degradation of ATR residues in rice plants. From a subset of MTs differentially expressed in ATR-exposed rice, forty-four O-methyltransferase genes were investigated. Total activities were significantly enhanced by ATR in rice tissues. To prove detoxifying capacity of the MTs in rice plants, two rice O-MTs (LOC_Os04g09604 and LOC_Os11g15040) were selected and transformed into yeast cells (Pichia pastoris X-33). The positive transformants accumulated less ATR and showed less toxicity. Using UPLC-TOF-MS/MS, ATR-degraded products in rice and yeast cells were characterized. A novel O-methylated-modified metabolite (atraton) and six other ATR-derivatives were detected. The topological interaction between LOC_Os04g09604 enzyme and its substrate was specially analyzed by homology modeling programs, which was well confirmed by the molecular docking analysis. The significance of the study is to provide a better understanding of mechanisms for the specific detoxification and degradation of ATR residues in rice growing in environmentally relevant ATR-contaminated soils and may hold a potential engineering perspective for generating ATR-resistant rice that helps to minimize ATR residues in crops.</p></details><hr><h4>Rapid and ultrasensitive detection of active thrombin based on the Vmh2 hydrophobin fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein.</h4><p>A. Piscitelli et al., Biosens Bioelectron 87 816 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27657843>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A fusion protein designed in order to combine the fluorescence emission of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) with the adhesion ability of the class I hydrophobin Vmh2 was heterologously produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The Vmh2-GFP fusion protein has proven to be a smart and effective tool for the study of Vmh2 self-assembling. Since the two proteins were linked by the specific cutting site of the thrombin, the fusion protein was used as the active biological element in the realization of a thrombin biosensor. When the thrombin present in the target solution specifically hydrolyzed its cleavage sequence, a consequent decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the sample could be observed. The Vmh2-GFP based assay allowed quantification of thrombin in solution with a detection limit of 2.27aM. The specificity of the assay with respect to other proteases and proteins granted the measurement of thrombin added to healthy human plasma with same high sensitivity and a limit of detection of 2.3aM. Further advantages of the developed biosensor are the simplicity of its design and preparation, and the low requirements in terms of samples, reagents and time.</p></details><hr><h4>The Y54(L)W mutation of anti-leukotriene C4 single-chain antibody increases affinity to leukotriene E4.</h4><p>Y.

To elucidate the individual contribution of Tyr-54 and Asn-58 in the light chain of mAbLTC, both of which formed a hydrogen bond with glutamic acid of LTC4, we examined whether substitution of the residues affects the antigen binding affinity and specificity using an anti-LTC4 single chain variable fragment (scFvLTC). Among the Tyr-54(L) mutants, Y54(L)W showed a dramatic increase in the affinity to LTE4 which was comparable to that to LTD4 Essentially the same results were obtained using the Y54(L)W mutant expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. The structural modeling suggested the formation of a novel hydrogen bond between the substituted tryptophan in the antibody and the cysteine residue in LTE4 The affinity of Y54(L)R, Y54(L)E and Y54(L)L to LTC4 was markedly reduced, whereas other tested Tyr-54(L) mutants as well as Asn-58(L) mutants did not show significant change in LT binding. The results may provide an insight into the molecular basis of specific LT recognition by the antibody.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of high activity Aspergillus niger BCC4525 beta-mannanase in Pichia pastoris and its application for mannooligosaccharides production from biomass hydrolysis.</h4><p>P.

The secreted enzyme hydrolyzed locust bean gum substrate with very high activity (1625 U/mL) and a relatively high kcat/Km (461 mg-1 s-1 mL). The enzyme is thermophilic and thermostable with an optimal temperature of 70 degrees C and 40% retention of endo-beta-1,4-mannanase activity after preincubation at 70 degrees C. In addition, the enzyme exhibited broad pH stability with an optimal pH of 5.5. The recombinant enzyme hydrolyzes low-cost biomass, including palm kernel meal (PKM) and copra meal, to produce mannooligosaccharides, which is used as prebiotics to promote the growth of beneficial microflora in animals. An in vitro digestibility test simulating the gastrointestinal tract system of broilers suggested that the recombinant beta-mannanase could effectively liberate reducing sugars from PKM-containing diet. These characteristics render this enzyme suitable for utilization as a feed additive to improve animal performance.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimized expression of prolyl aminopeptidase in Pichia pastoris and its characteristics after glycosylation.</h4><p>H.

In the present study, the prolyl aminopeptidase gene (pap) from Aspergillus oryzae JN-412 was optimized through the codon usage of Pichia pastoris. Both the native and optimized pap genes were inserted into the expression vector pPIC9 K and were successfully expressed in P. pastoris. Additionally, the activity of the intracellular enzyme expressed by the recombinant optimized pap gene reached 61.26 U mL(-1), an activity that is 2.1-fold higher than that of the native gene. The recombinant enzyme was purified by one-step elution through Ni-affinity chromatography. The optimal temperature and pH of the purified PAP were 60 degrees C and 7.5, respectively. Additionally, the recombinant PAP was recovered at a yield greater than 65 % at an extremely broad range of pH values from 6 to 10 after treatment at 50 degrees C for 6 h. The molecular weight of the recombinant PAP decreased from 50 kDa to 48 kDa after treatment with a deglycosylation enzyme, indicating that the recombinant PAP was completely glycosylated. The glycosylated PAP exhibited high thermo-stability. Half of the activity remained after incubation at 50 degrees C for 50 h, whereas the remaining activity of PAP expressed in E. coli was only 10 % after incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h. PAP could be activated by the appropriate salt concentration and exhibited salt tolerance against NaCl at a concentration up to 5 mol L(-1).</p></details><hr><h4>Functional expression and characterization of a glucuronoyl esterase from the fungus Neurospora crassa: identification of novel consensus sequences containing the catalytic triad.</h4><p>H.

The enzyme glucuronoyl esterase (GE) that constitutes a novel family of carbohydrate esterases, CE15, has been shown to display a unique ability to cleave the ester linkage between lignin alcohols and xylan-bound 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of hemicellulose. We herein report identification, expression, and functional characterization of a new GE, NcGE, from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. C-terminally c-myc and hexahistidine-tagged NcGE was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. NcGE purified from the culture supernatant through Ni-NTA and anion exchange chromatographies showed the ability to hydrolyze the substrate 3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propyl methyl 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosiduronate, which mimics the ester linkage of 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). This esterase showed the characteristic of a mesophilic enzyme with the temperature optimum at 40-50 degrees C, and displayed the optimal activity at pH 7 and broad pH stability. Based on the alignment of NcGE with other GEs so far characterized, we propose novel consensus sequences for GEs containing the catalytic triad.</p></details><hr><h4>The sequence variation and functional differentiation of CRDs in a scallop multiple CRDs containing lectin.</h4><p>M.

Its four CRDs with EPD/LSD, EPN/FAD, EPN/LND and EPN/YND key motifs were recombined separately. The recombinant proteins of CRD1 and CRD2 (designated as rCRD1 and rCRD2) could bind LPS and mannan, while the recombinant proteins of CRD3 and CRD4 (designated as rCRD3 and rCRD4) could bind LPS, PGN, mannan and glucan. Moreover, rCRD3 displayed broad microbe binding spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum, as well as fungi Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica. These results indicated CRD3 contributed more to CfLec-4's nonself-recognition ability. Furthermore, CRD1, CRD3 and CRD4 functioned as opsonin participating in the clearance against invaders in scallops. The sequence variation in Ca2+ binding site 2 among CRDs was suspected to be associated with such functional differentiation.</p></details><hr><h4>Psc-AFP from Psoralea corylifolia L. overexpressed in Pichia pastoris increases antimicrobial activity and enhances disease resistance of transgenic tobacco.</h4><p>X.

Its encoding gene was cloned by 3'- rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) combined with Y-shaped adaptor-dependent extension (YADE) method. The gene Psc-AFP encodes a protein of 203 amino acids with a deduced signal peptide of 24 residues. The growth inhibition effect exerted by the heterologously expressed Psc-AFP in Pichia pastoris revealed that the recombinant Psc-AFP inhibited mycelium growth of Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, and Alternaria brassicae and conidial germination of Alternaria alternata. The recombinant Psc-AFP also showed protease inhibitor activity manifested by the inhibition of trypsin. The transgenic tobacco bioassays confirmed that overexpressing Psc-AFP significantly enhanced the disease resistance of tobacco and that some of the transgenic lines were almost fully tolerant to Ralstonia solanacearum and A. alternata, whereas no apparent alteration in plant growth and development was observed. Collectively, these results indicate that the recombinant Psc-AFP is an active antimicrobial protein, with protease inhibitor activity that can be successfully produced in the yeast and tobacco and, therefore, maybe a potential antimicrobial candidate for practical use.</p></details><hr><h4>Feruloyl esterases from Schizophyllum commune to treat food industry side-streams.</h4><p>A.

Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) from Schizophyllum commune were functionally expressed in Pichia pastoris with extracellular activities of 6000UL(-1). The recombinant enzymes, ScFaeD1 and ScFaeD2, released ferulic acid from destarched wheat bran and sugar beet pectin. Overnight incubation of coffee pulp released caffeic (>60%), ferulic (>80%) and p-coumaric acid (100%) indicating applicability for the valorization of food processing wastes and enhanced biomass degradation. Based on substrate specificity profiling and the release of diferulates from destarched wheat bran, the recombinant FAEs were characterized as type D FAEs. ScFaeD1 and ScFaeD2 preferably hydrolyzed feruloylated saccharides with ferulic acid esterified to the O-5 position of arabinose residues and showed an unprecedented ability to hydrolyze benzoic acid esters.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of recombinant Newcastle disease virus F protein in Pichia pastoris and its immunogenicity using flagellin as the adjuvant.</h4><p>X.

Although both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are used to prevent and control the spread of ND among chickens, the increasing number of ND outbreaks in commercial poultry flocks worldwide indicates that routine vaccinations are insufficient to control ND. Hence, efforts are being invested into developing alternative and more effective vaccination strategies. In this study, we focus on F protein, the neutralizing and protective antigen of NDV, and flagellin (FliC), a toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist that is an effective inducer of innate immune responses. We amplified F gene from velogenic NDV strain F48E8. The recombinant histidine (His)-tagged F protein was efficiently expressed in a Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) eukaryotic system and verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. The conditions for F protein expression in P. pastoris were optimal. The immunogenicity of F protein with FliC as the adjuvant was evaluated in a C3H/HeJ mouse model. FliC was found to enhance both F-specific and NDV-specific IgG responses and F-specific cellular immune responses following intraperitoneal co-administration with F protein. Thus, the recombinant F protein expressed by P. pastoris when used with flagellin as the adjuvant has potential as a subunit vaccine candidate.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and purification of the kinase domain of PINK1 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D. Wu et al., Protein Expr Purif 128 67 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27546451>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a Ser/Thr kinase that specifically localizes on the mitochondrial membrane. It cooperates with Parkin to regulate mitochondrial quality control. Mutations in PINK1 protein which account for 8-15% of Parkinson's disease (PD), are the second most common cause of early-onset Autosomal Recessive Parkinson's disease (AR-PD). The lack of methods for PINK1 heterologous expression and purification has slowed progress in the AR-PD research field. To pave the way for direct structural study of this important protein, in this study, we developed an efficient expression system of recombinant PINK1 kinase domain (rPINK1) using Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Our results showed that rPINK1 is best expressed in P. pastoris at 25 degrees C induction. Additionally, we determined that the optimal induction time was 72 h and the optimal induction methanol concentration was 1% for the expression of rPINK1 in P. pastoris. Subsequent purification by Ni affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA) and cation-exchange chromatography (Mono S) produced the protein with purity higher than 95%. The pure rPINK1 was active to phosphorylate ubiquitin in a substrate phosphorylation assay. Overall, these studies provide the first effective method for heterologous expression and purification of the rPINK1 with a high purity. These findings can help contribute to further researches on the interactions study and biochemical characterization of PINK1.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression, purification and identification of a thermolysin-like protease, neutral protease I, from Aspergillus oryzae with the Pichia pastoris expression system.</h4><p>X.

This study was designed to obtain high expression levels of neutral protease I from Aspergillus oryzae 3.042 by using Pichia pastoris GS115 as the host strain for industrial purposes. The coding sequence of the target gene was modified, synthesized, and then cloned into the expression vector pHBM905BDM, which harbored the d1+2 x 201 AOX1 promoter and the MF4I leader sequence. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant strain was used for high-density fermentation in a 4-L fermenter. The yield of the target protein reached 12.87 mg/mL, and the enzyme activity was approximately 49370 U/mL, which indicated that this enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris at a high level. The target protein was purified and characterized. Its optimum temperature and pH were 55 degrees C and 8.0, respectively. This enzyme was extremely sensitive to EDTA, which is consistent with the previous reports that it is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. Our results indicated that low concentrations of zinc, calcium and magnesium ions stimulated the enzyme activity, whereas high concentrations inhibited its activity. In addition, calcium and magnesium ions increased the thermostability of the enzyme. All of the evidence indicated that this protease is a thermolysin-like peptidase.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and characterization of thermostable glucose dehydrogenases from thermophilic filamentous fungi.</h4><p>K.

In order to obtain a novel FAD-GDH gene homolog, we performed degenerate PCR screening of genomic DNAs from 17 species of thermophilic filamentous fungi. Two FAD-GDH gene homologs were identified and cloned from Talaromyces emersonii NBRC 31232 and Thermoascus crustaceus NBRC 9129. We then prepared the recombinant enzymes produced by Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Absorption spectra and enzymatic assays revealed that the resulting enzymes contained oxidized FAD as a cofactor and exhibited glucose dehydrogenase activity. The transition midpoint temperatures (T m) were 66.4 and 62.5 degrees C for glycosylated FAD-GDHs of T. emersonii and T. crustaceus prepared by using P. pastoris as a host, respectively. Therefore, both FAD-GDHs exhibited high thermostability. In conclusion, we propose that these thermostable FAD-GDHs could be ideal enzymes for use as thermotolerant glucose sensors with high accuracy.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant overexpression of camel hepcidin cDNA in Pichia pastoris: purification and characterization of the polyHis-tagged peptide HepcD-His.</h4><p>M.

The aim of this work was the expression, as secreted peptide, purification, and characterization of a new recombinant polyHis-tagged camel hepcidin (HepcD-His) in yeast Pichia pastoris. The use of this eukaryotic expression system, for the production of HepcD-His, having 6 histidine residues at its C terminus, was simpler and more efficient compared with the use of the prokaryotic system Escherichia coli. Indeed, a single purification step was required to isolate the soluble hepcidin with purity estimated more that 94% and a yield of 2.8 against 0.2 mg/L for the E coli system. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry of the purified HepcD-His showed 2 major peaks at m/z 4524.64 and 4634.56 corresponding to camel hepcidin with 39 and 40 amino acids. Evaluation of disulfide bond connectivity with the Ellman method showed an absence of free thiol groups, testifying that the 8 cysteine residues in the peptide are displayed, forming 4 disulfide bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that camel hepcidin structure was significantly modified at high temperature of 90 degrees C and returns to its original structure when incubation temperature drops back to 20 degrees C. Interestingly, this peptide showed also a greater bactericidal activity, at low concentration of 9.5muM, against E coli, than the synthetic analog DH3. Thus, the production, at a large scale, of the recombinant camel hepcidin, HepcD-His, may be helpful for future therapeutic applications including bacterial infection diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a high sweetness and heat-resistant mutant of sweet-tasting protein, monellin, in Pichia pastoris with a constitutive GAPDH promoter and modified N-terminus.</h4><p>C.

The sweetness threshold of wild-type and E2 N were 30 mug/ml and 20 mug/ml, respectively. Compared with the proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, the thermostability of both proteins was improved. The N-terminal sequence is determinative for the sweetness of the proteins expressed in yeast strains.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Site-directed mutagenesis, modification of the N-terminus of monellin, and without the need of methanol induction in P. pastoris expression system, indicate the possibility for large-scale production of this sweet-tasting protein.</p></details><hr><h4>High-yield fermentation and a novel heat-precipitation purification method for hydrophobin HGFI from Grifola frondosa in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

Here, we reported a high-yield fermentation method for hydrophobin HGFI from Grifola frondosa in Pichia pastoris, attaining production of 300 mg/L by keeping the dissolved oxygen level at 15%-25% by turning the methanol-feeding speed. We also developed a novel HGFI-purification method enabling large-scare purification of HGFI, with >90% recovery. Additionally, we observed that hydrophobin HGFI in fermentation broth precipitated at pH < 7.0 and temperatures >90 degrees C. We also identified the structure and properties of proteins purified by this method through atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water-contact angle measurement, which is similar to protein purification by ultrafiltration without heating treatment that enables our method to maintain native HGFI structure and properties. Furthermore, the purification method presented here can be applied to large-scale purification of other type I hydrophobins.</p></details><hr><h4>Endogenous signal peptides in recombinant protein production by Pichia pastoris: From in-silico analysis to fermentation.</h4><p>A.

The expression was conducted under glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (PGAP). The highest secretion efficiency among endogenous SPs was obtained by SP23 followed by SP24, SP34, SP13 and SP26, respectively. The fermentation characteristics of rhGH production by the use of SP23, the most favorable endogenous SP of P.pastoris, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor prepro sequence (alpha-MF) were compared. With respect to the SP23 which is 73 amino acids shorter in length compared to alpha-MF, in high cell density cultures, where carbon and energy source are limited, the substitution of SP23 for alpha-MF seems promising. alpha-MF higher secretion efficiency was verified by major physicochemical properties including hydropathy index, isoelectric point, and aliphatic index. Regarding the examined endogenous SPs, there was no clear correlation between secretion efficiency and major physicochemical properties when each of these properties was considered independently. To find a correlation, factors such as protein N-terminus effect, length of the SP, secondary structure of the SP, and interactions of the selected properties should also be investigated.</p></details><hr><h4>A new non-phagocytic TLR6 with broad recognition ligands from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.</h4><p>W.

Recently, the expansion of TLRs has been reported in invertebrate genomes, but the characters and immune functions of these expanded TLRs were still not well known. In the present study, a new member of TLR family with five LRR domains was identified in Crassostrea gigas (designated CgTLR6). It shared homology with TLRs from other organisms with the closest phylogenic relationship with molluscan TLRs. The recombinant protein of CgTLR6 (rCgTLR6) displayed direct bind activity to gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio splendidus, gram-positive bacteria Staphylococci aureus and Micrococcus luteus, and fungi Pichia pastoris, but not to fungi Yarrowia lipolytica. It also exhibited affinity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN), while no affinity to mannan (MAN). The mRNA of CgTLR6 was mainly detected in hemocytes and hepatopancreas, and was significantly induced (p < 0.01) in hemocytes after the oyster was stimulated with LPS, PGN or bacteria V. splendidus. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that CgTLR6 was mainly located at the membrane of hemocytes. The blockage of CgTLR6 by anti-rCgTLR6 antibody did not significantly inhibit the phagocytic rates of hemocytes toward recognized gram-negative bacteria V. anguillarum and V. splendidus, and unrecognized fungi Y. lipolytica. These results collectively implied that CgTLR6 was a novel non-phagocytic receptor of C. gigas to mediate humoral immune response by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the invaders.</p></details><hr><h4>Comparative thermal inactivation analysis of Aspergillus oryzae and Thiellavia terrestris cutinase: Role of glycosylation.</h4><p>A.

A detailed thermal inactivation analysis was performed for two well-characterized cutinases, Aspergillus oryzae Cutinase (AoC) and Thiellavia terrestris Cutinase (TtC). Both AoC and TtC are prone to thermal aggregation upon unfolding at high temperature, which was found to be a major reason for irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Our study demonstrates that glycosylation stabilizes TtC expressed in Pichia pastoris by inhibiting its thermal aggregation. Based on the comparative thermal inactivation analyses of non-glycosylated AoC, glycosylated (TtC-G), and non-glycosylated TtC (TtC-NG), a unified model for thermal inactivation is proposed that accounts for thermal aggregation and may be applicable to other cutinase homologues. Inspired by glycosylated TtC, we successfully employed glycosylation site engineering to inhibit AoC thermal aggregation. Indeed, the inhibition of thermal aggregation by AoC glycosylation was greater than that achieved by conventional use of trehalose under a typical condition. Collectively, this study demonstrates the excellent potential of implementing glycosylation site engineering for thermal aggregation inhibition, which is one of the most common reasons for the irreversible thermal inactivation of cutinases and many proteins.

To produce large quantity of Mytichitin-A to further investigate its biological activity, nucleotide sequence encoding a recombinant 6 x His-Mytichitin-A (rMytichitin-A) peptide was synthesized and inserted into the inducible yeast expression vector pPICZalphaA. With the availability of such an expression vector called pPICZalphaA-Mytichitin-A, we transformed Pichia pastoris GS115 cells with a SacI-linearized pPICZalphaA-Mytichitin-A by electroporation. Transgenic strains secreting rMytichitin-A with a molecular weight of approximate 10 KDa as expected were obtained. The optimal culture condition for rMytichitin-A expression was determined to be 1.0% methanol induction, 96 h incubation at 28 degrees C and the amount of rMytichitin-A reached 45.5 mug/ml. The percentage of rMytichitin-A was estimated to be 73.6% of the total protein. After rMytichitin-A was purified using nickel ions affinity chromatography, approximate 9.1 mg pure rMytichitin-A was obtained from 500 ml of cell culture medium with 97.8% purity. More importantly, both the culture supernatant and purified rMytichitin-A inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with a minimum inhibition concentration of as low as 31 and 48 mug/ml, respectively. Differently from the native protein, however, the rMytichitin-A is not active against Gram-negative bacteria. Taken together, this is the first report on the heterologous expression of Mytichitin-A in P. pastoris. Our study showed that P. pastoris is an effective expression system for producing large quantities of biologically active Mytichitin-A for both research and application purposes.</p></details><hr><h4>Constitutive expression of recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

A DNA fragment containing core domain of human PH20 gene was cloned into a constitutive expression plasmid (pGAPZalphaC) of Pichia pastoris to produce a fusion protein with alpha factor signal in the N-terminus and 6 x His as well as c-Myc tags in the C-terminus. The resulting plasmid pGAPZalphaC-PH20 was integrated into the genome of P. pastoris strain GS115. Functional recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20) was successfully expressed and secreted by the recombinant P. pastoris transformant. Highest hyaluronidase activity of 2 mU/mL could be obtained at 3 day in an YPD culture. After purified by phenylboronic acid resin adsorption, rHuPH20 with a specific activity of 230 mU/mg was obtained. Via periodic acid-Schiff staining and zymogram analysis, the partially purified rHuPH20 was determined to be highly glycosylated to various extents with molecular mass in the range of 100-300 kDa. The enzyme showed a maximal activity at pH 5.0 but no appreciable activity at pH </=3 and pH >/=8. The hyaluronidase activity could be stably maintained at 4 degrees C but lost 40% after incubating at 30 degrees C for 4 h. Both N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione showed a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8 mM against rHuPH20.</p></details><hr><h4>Penicillium purpurogenum produces a highly stable endo-beta-(1,4)-galactanase.</h4><p>V.

The filamentous fungus Penicillium purpurogenum, which grows on a number of natural carbon sources, among them sugar beet pulp which contains pectin, has a gene (ppgal1) coding an endo-beta-1,4-galactanase (PpGAL1). This enzyme was expressed heterologously in Pichia pastoris. It has a molecular mass of 38 kDa, a pH optimum of 4-4.5, and an optimal temperature of 60 degrees C. It is 100 % stable for up to 24 h at pH 4-4.5 and 40 degrees C. These stability properties, which exceed those from other endo-beta-1,4-galactanases reported to date, make it particularly suitable for industrial processes requiring acidic conditions and temperatures up to 40 degrees C. PpGAL1 is, therefore, a potentially effective tool in the food industry and in other biotechnological applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhanced cell-surface display and secretory production of cellulolytic enzymes with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sed1 signal peptide.</h4><p>K.

A crucial step for cell wall localization of the enzymes is the intracellular transport of proteins in yeast cells. Therefore, the addition of a highly efficient secretion signal sequence is important to increase the amount of the enzymes on the yeast cell surface. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel signal peptide (SP) sequence derived from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SED1 gene for cell-surface display and secretory production of cellulolytic enzymes. Gene cassettes with SP sequences derived from S. cerevisiae SED1 (SED1SP), Rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase (GLUASP), and S. cerevisiae alpha-mating pheromone (MFalpha1SP) were constructed for cell-surface display of Aspergillus aculeatus beta-glucosidase (BGL1) and Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II (EGII). These gene cassettes were integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome. The recombinant strains with the SED1SP showed higher cell-surface BGL and EG activities than those with the conventional SP sequences (GLUASP and MFalpha1SP). The novel SP sequence also improved the secretory production of BGL and EG in S. cerevisiae. The extracellular BGL activity of the recombinant strains with the SED1SP was 1.3- and 1.9-fold higher than the GLUASP and MFalpha1SP strains, respectively. Moreover, the utilization of SED1SP successfully enhanced the secretory production of BGL in Pichia pastoris. The utilization of the novel SP sequence is a promising option for highly efficient cell-surface display and secretory production of heterologous proteins in various yeast species. Biotechnol.

The chemometric tools for biomass estimation were multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and principal component regression (PCR). Variable importance in the projection (VIP) scores were used to rate the importance of model input variables, indicating tryptophan as the most important variable for biomass estimation. A direct correlation between the single fluorescence signals of tryptophan and biomass was additionally set up. Results indicate a successful fitting of the MLR, PLSR, PCR, and direct tryptophan correlation models for the present case and confirm the relevance of biogenic fluorophores for bioprocess state variables monitoring. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) between the predicted and measured values for the validation batches was 0.017, 0.023, 0.025, and 0.049 g L(-1) dry cell weight for MLR, PLSR, PCR, and direct tryptophan correlation, respectively. The presented approach of indirectly measuring biomass based on combined single-wavelength fluorescence measurements can be used for the development of a low-cost alternative to 2D fluorescence spectroscopy.

A peptide epitope from human papillomavirus (HPV) minor capsid protein L2 displayed on thioredoxin (Trx) has been validated preclinically as a broadly protective and low-cost alternative HPV vaccine. Focusing on thioredoxin from the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrx) as a scaffold, we have constructed a modified Pichia pastoris expression vector and used a PfTrx fusion derivative containing three tandemly repeated copies of a 19 amino acids peptide epitope from HPV-L2 for expression optimization and biochemical-immunological characterization of the Pichia-produced PfTrx-L2 antigen. We show that PfTrx-L2 is produced at high levels (up to 100 mg from a 100 ml starting culture using a multi-cycle induction protocol) and secreted into the culture medium as a highly enriched (>70% pure), non-glycosylated polypeptide that can be purified to homogeneity in a single step. Oxidation and aggregation state, thermal stability and immunogenicity of the endotoxin-free PfTrx-L2 antigen produced in P. pastoris were tested and found to be identical to those of the same antigen produced in Escherichia coli. Secretory production of endotoxin-free PfTrx-peptides in P. pastoris represents a cost- and time-effective alternative to E. coli production. Specifically designed for peptide antigens, the PfTrx-expression vector and conditions described herein are easily transferable to a variety of applications centred on the use of structurally constrained bioactive peptides as immune as well as target-specific binder reagents.</p></details><hr><h4>In-vitro and in-vivo biological activity of recombinant yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) follicle stimulating hormone.</h4><p>P.

They compare favorably to immobilized lipase and chemically catalyzed processes. Genetically modified whole-cell lipase-mediated in vitro route, together with in vivo and ex vivo microbial biosynthesis routes, constitutes emerging and rapidly developing research areas for effective production of biodiesel. This review presents recent advances in customizing microorganisms for producing biodiesel, via genetic engineering of lipases and metabolic engineering (including system regulation) of fatty-acids-derived pathways. Microbial hosts used include Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris and Aspergillus oryzae. These microbial cells can be genetically modified to produce lipases under different forms: intracellularly expressed, secreted or surface-displayed. They can be metabolically redesigned and systematically regulated to obtain balanced biodiesel-producing cells, as highlighted in this study. Such genetically or metabolically modified microbial cells can support not only in vitro biotransformation of various common oil feedstocks to biodiesel, but also de novo biosynthesis of biodiesel from glucose, glycerol or even cellulosic biomass. We believe that the genetically tractable oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica could be developed to an effective biodiesel-producing microbial cell factory. For this purpose, we propose several engineered pathways, based on lipase and wax ester synthase, in this promising oleaginous host.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering of Harobin for enhanced fibrinolytic activity obtained by random and site-directed mutagenesis.</h4><p>Z. Li et al., Protein Expr Purif 129 162 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363113>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We have previously published a report on the cloning and characterization of Harobin, a fibrinolytic serine protease. However, the broad application of this fibrinolytic enzyme is limited by its low expression level that was achieved in Pichia pastoris. To counteract this shortcoming, random and site-directed mutagenesis have been combined in order to improve functional expression and activity of Harobin. By screening 400 clones from random mutant libraries for enhanced fibrinolytic activity, two mutants were obtained: N111R, R230G. By performing site-directed mutagenesis, a Harobin double mutant, N111R/R230G, was constructed and can be functionally expressed at higher level than the wild type enzyme. In addition, it possessed much higher fibrinolytic and amidolytic activity than the wild type enzyme and other single mutants. The N111R/R230G expressed in basal salts medium was purified by a three step purification procedure. At pH of 6.0-9.0, and the temperature range of 40-90 degrees C, N111R/R230G was more active and more heat resistant. The fibrinolytic activities of Harobin mutants were completely inhibited by PMSF and SBTI, but not by EDTA, EGTA, DTT, indicating that Harobin is a serine protease. N111R/R230G showed much better anti-thrombosis effect than wild type Harobin and single mutants, and could significantly increase bleeding and clotting time. Intravenous injection of N111R/R230G in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p < 0.01), while heart rate (HR) was not affected. The in vitro and in vivo results of the present study revealed that Harobin double mutant N111R/R230G is an appropriate candidate for biotechnological applications due to its high expression level and high activity in area of thrombosis and hypertension.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous production of a feruloyl esterase from Pleurotus sapidus synthesizing feruloyl-saccharide esters.</h4><p>S. Kelle et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem 63 852 (2016).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272349>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene EST1 from the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Catalytically active recombinant Est1 was secreted using P. pastoris as a host. For expression in P. pastoris, the expression vector pPIC9K was applied. The EST1 gene was cloned with an N-terminal alpha-mating factor pre-pro sequence and expressed under the control of a methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promotor. Est1 was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant Est1 showed optima at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C, and released ferulic acid from saccharide esters and from the natural substrate destarched wheat bran. Substrate specificity profile and descriptor-based analysis demonstrated unique properties, showing that Est1 did not fit into the current FAE classification model. Transferuloylation synthesis of feruloyl-saccharide esters was proven for mono- and disaccharides.</p></details>
