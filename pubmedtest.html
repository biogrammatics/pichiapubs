CYP5150AN1 catalyzed the 2beta-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycortisol. It is interesting that they display different regioselectivity of hydroxylation from their isoenzyme, CYP5150AP2, which possesses 19- and 11beta-hydroxylase activity.IMPORTANCE The steroidal hydroxylases CYP5150AP3 and CYP5150AN1 together with the previously characterized CYP5150AP2 belong to the CYP5150A family of P450 enzymes with high amino acid sequence identity, but they showed completely different regioselectivities towards 11-deoxycortisol, suggesting the regioselectivity diversity of steroidal hydroxylases of CYP5150 family. They are also distinct from the known bacterial and fungal steroidal hydroxylases in substrate specificity and regioselectivity. Biocatalytic hydroxylation is one of the important transformations for the functionalization of steroid nucleus rings, but remains a very challenging task in organic synthesis. These hydroxylases are useful additions to the tool-box of hydroxylase enzymes for the functionalization of steroids at various positions.</p></details></div>

The growing problem of drug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, together with the lack of new effective compounds, has stimulated interest in developing AMPs as anti-infective molecules. PAF102 is an AMP that was rationally designed for improved antifungal properties. This cell penetrating peptide has potent and specific activity against major fungal pathogens. Cecropin A is a natural AMP with strong and fast lytic activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens, including multidrug resistant pathogens. Both peptides, PAF102 and Cecropin A, are alternative antibiotic compounds. However, their exploitation requires fast, cost-efficient production systems. Here, we developed an innovative system to produce AMPs in Pichia pastoris using the oleosin fusion technology. Oleosins are plant-specific proteins with a structural role in lipid droplet formation and stabilization, which are used as carriers for recombinant proteins to lipid droplets in plant-based production systems. This study reports the efficient production of PAF102 in P. pastoris when fused to the rice plant Oleosin 18, whereas no accumulation of Cecropin A was detected. The Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein targets the lipid droplets of the heterologous system where it accumulates to high levels. Interestingly, the production of this fusion protein induces the formation of lipid droplets in yeast cells, which can be additionally enhanced by the coexpression of a diacylglycerol transferase gene that allows a three-fold increase in the production of the fusion protein. Using this high producer strain, PAF102 reaches commercially relevant yields of up to 180 mg/l of yeast culture. Moreover, the accumulation of PAF102 in the yeast lipid droplets facilitates its downstream extraction and recovery by flotation on density gradients, with the recovered PAF102 being biologically active against pathogenic fungi. Our results demonstrate that plant oleosin fusion technology can be transferred to the well-established P. pastoris cell factory to produce the PAF102 antifungal peptide, and potentially other AMPs, for multiple applications in crop protection, food preservation and animal and human therapies.</p></details></div>

To accomplish high-throughput production of various nanobodies, utilization of microbes is an attractive option. In the present study, various chimeric nanobodies were prepared using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. We designed chimeric nanobodies with complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) based on the scaffold of GFP-nanobody. FLAG-tagged chimeric nanobodies were prepared by one-step cloning and produced using P. pastoris. Secreted chimeric nanobodies were purified from the culture media of P. pastoris transformants. Relative binding abilities of purified chimeric nanobodies to GFP and CD4 was tested using a BIACORE T-200. P. pastoris successfully produced a high yield of FLAG-tagged chimeric nanobodies. FLAG-tagged GFP- and CD4-nanobodies were shown to specifically bind to GFP and CD4, respectively. Chimeric nanobodies, in which the CDR2 or 3 of GFP-nanobody was replaced with CDRs of CD4-nanobody, acquired the ability to bind to CD4 without binding to GFP. These results demonstrate successful production of functional chimeric nanobodies using P. pastoris. These results also suggest that swapping of CDRs, especially CDRs 2 or 3, potentially enables a novel method of creating nanobodies.</p></details></div>

Setosphaeria turcica produced three active laccase isozymes: Stlac1, Stlac2, and Stlac6. Stlac2 was heterologously expressed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems. The eukaryotic recombinant Stlac2 expressed in Pichia pastoris was inactive, and also showed a higher molecular weight than predicted because of glycosylation. The depression of laccase activity was attributable to the incorrect glycosylation at Asn97. Stlac2 expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant Stlac2 exhibited activity of 28.23U/mg with 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate. The highest activity was observed at pH of 4.5 and the temperature of 60 degrees C. The activity of recombinant Stlac2 was inhibited by 10mM Na(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+), and increased by 10mM of Fe(3+) with a relatively activity of 315% compared with no addition.

Two of these residues were selected for mutations to improve the enzyme's thermostability, and the variants predicted by MD simulations to have improved thermostability were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 for further investigations. According to the proline rule, the high fluctuation site S115 or V213 was replaced with proline residue, the two lipase mutants S115P and V213P were obtained. The mutant V213P exhibited evidently enhanced thermostability with an approximately 70% longer half-life at 50 degrees C than that of the parent LIP2 expressed in P. pastoris. The temperature optimum of V213P was 42 degrees C, which was about 5.0 degrees C higher than that of the parent LIP2, while its specific catalytic activity was comparable to that of the parent and reached 876.5U/mg. The improved thermostability of V213P together with its high catalytic efficiency indicated that the rational design strategy employed here can be efficiently applied for structure optimization of industrially important enzymes.</p></details></div>

Hence, suitable systems need to be developed to validate the sensor readings prior to their use in monitoring and control systems. This study presents a novel approach for online validation of sensor readings. The basic idea is to compare the original sensor reading with predictions for this sensor reading based on the remaining sensor network's information. Deviations between original and predicted sensor readings are used to indicate sensor faults. Since especially batch processes show varying lengths and different phases (e.g., lag and exponential phase), prediction models that are dependent on process time are necessary. The binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to select the best prediction models for each time step. A regularization approach is utilized to avoid overfitting. Models with high complexity and prediction errors are penalized, resulting in optimal predictions for the sensor reading at each time step (5% mean relative prediction error). The sensor reliability is calculated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of model-based predictions and the distribution of a moving window of original sensor readings (moving window size = 10 readings). The developed system allows for the online detection of sensor faults. This is especially important when sensor data are used as input to soft sensors for critical quality attributes or the process control system. The proof-of-concept is exemplarily shown for a turbidity sensor that is used to monitor a Pichia pastoris-batch process.</p></details></div>

The complete degradation of xylan requires the action of several enzymes, among them beta-xylosidase. The fungus Penicillium purpurogenum secretes a number of enzymes participating in the degradation of xylan. In this study, a beta-xylosidase from this fungus was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized. This enzyme (Xyl2) is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 3; it consists of a sequence of 792 residues including a signal peptide of 20 residues, with a theoretical molecular mass for the mature protein of 84.2KDa and an isoelectric point of 5.07. The highest identity with a characterized fungal enzyme, is with a beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (70%). The optimal activity of Xyl2 is found at pH 2.0 and 28 degrees C. The enzyme is most stable at pH 2.0 and conserves 40% of activity at 42 degrees C (after 1h incubation). The kinetic parameters for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside are: KM 0.53 mM, kcat 1*10(7) s(-1) and kcat/KM 1.9*10(10)M(-1)s(-1). The enzyme is about 10% active on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside. Xyl2 exhibits a high hydrolytic activity on xylooligosaccharides; it liberates xylose from beechwood and birchwood glucuronoxylan and it acts synergistically with endoxylanases in the degradation of xylan. Its low pH optimum make this enzyme particularly useful in potential applications requiring a low pH such as increasing the flavor of wine.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a novel CTL (designated as CgCLec-3) was identified from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. There was only one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of 151amino acid residues within the deduced amino acid sequence of CgCLec-3. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgCLec-3 CRD shared low homology with the CRDs of other CTLs in oyster with the identities ranging from 12% to 22%. A novel DIN motif was found in Ca(2+)-binding site 2 of CgCLec-3. The relative expression level of CgCLec-3 in hemocytes was up-regulated significantly after the stimulations of bacteria and Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). Immunohistochemistry assay showed that CgCLec-3 protein was mainly distributed in gill and mantle, less in gonad, and could not be detected in adductor muscle and hepatopancreas. The recombinant protein (rCgCLec-3) could bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mannose (MAN) and peptidoglycan (PGN), but not poly (</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C). rCgCLec-3 exihibited strong binding ability to Vibrio anguillarum and V. splendidus, moderate binding activities to Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica, weak binding affinity to Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. rCgCLec-3 could agglutinate microorganisms, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and its activity to agglutinate V. splendidus was remarkably higher than that to agglutinate E. coli, S. aureus and P. pastoris. The phagocytic activity of oyster hemocytes was significantly enhanced after incubation with rCgCLec-3. rCgCLec-3 also exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. The results clearly suggested that CgCLec-3 in Pacific oyster C. gigas not only served as a PRR involved in the PAMPs recognition and microbes binding, but also functioned as an immune effector participating in the clearance of invaders.</p></details></div>

Despite being an efficient producer, we observed previously that certain recombinant proteins were mistargeted to the vacuole on their route to secretion. Simultaneous disruption of one vacuolar sorting pathway together with vacuolar proteases prevented this mis-sorting and resulted in higher levels of secreted heterologous protein. Inspired by the positive results, we now set out to investigate the influence of further parts of the vacuolar pathway, namely the Cvt-pathway and the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Strains impaired in the Cvt pathway (atg11, atg8) had no effect on secretion of the model protein carboxylesterase (CES), but resulted in lower secretion levels of the antibody fragment HyHEL-Fab. Disruption of genes involved in the HOPS complex led to vacuole-like compartments of the B category of vps mutants, which are characteristic for the deleted genes YPT7, VPS41 and VAM6. In particular ypt7 and vam6 strains showed an improvement in secreting the model proteins HyHEL-Fab and CES. Additional disruption of the vacuolar protease Pep4 and the potential protease Vps70 led to even further enhanced secretion in ypt7 and vam6 strains. Nevertheless, intracellular product accumulation was still observed. Therefore, the secretory route was strengthened by overexpression of early or late secretory genes in the vacuolar sorting mutants. Thereby, overexpression of Sbh1, a subunit of the ER translocation pore, significantly increased HyHEL-Fab secretion, leading up to fourfold higher extracellular Fab levels in the ypt7 strain. The beneficial impact on protein secretion and the suitability of these strains for industrial applicability was confirmed in fed-batch cultivations.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Disruption of genes involved in the HOPS complex, especially YPT7, has a great influence on the secretion of the two different model proteins HyHEL-Fab and CES. Therefore, disruption of HOPS genes shows a high potential to increase secretion of other recombinant proteins as well. Secretion of HyHEL-Fab was further enhanced when overexpressing secretion enhancing factors. As the positive effect was also present in fed-batch cultivations, these modifications likely have promising industrial relevance.</p></details></div>

A major source of variability is related to viral genotypes and subgenotypes. Their possible influence on diagnosis and prophylaxis is poorly known and has mostly been evaluated for genotypes A, B, C and D. Robust data showing the detection efficiency of HBsAg from genotype F is lacking. This study examined the effect of virus-like particles containing HBsAg from genotypes A and F (particularly, F1b and F4) produced in Pichia pastoris in relation to the anti-HBs antibodies used in the immunoassays for in vitro diagnosis and compared it with that exerted by the G145R S-escape mutant. The results showed that HBsAg detection rates for subgenotypes F1b and F4 differed significantly from those obtained for genotype A and that subgenotype F1b had a major impact on the sensitivity of the immunoassays tested. Prediction of the tertiary structure of subgenotypes F1b and F4 revealed changes inside and outside the major hydrophilic region (aa 101-160) of the HBsAg compared to genotype A and the G145R variant. A phosphorylation site (target for protein kinase C) produced by the G145R substitution might prevent recognition by anti-HBs antibodies. In conclusion, the use of different genotypes or variants for diagnosis could improve the rate of detection of HBV infection. The incorporation of a genotype-F-derived HBsAg vaccine in areas where this genotype is endemic should be evaluated, since this might also affect vaccination efficacy.</p></details></div>

In this study, we show that this difference is partly due to the N-glycosylation of the recombinant CFP32 (rCFP32) by the yeast Pichia pastoris. In addition, SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis of Mycobacterium bovis BCG and yeast-produced rCFP32 showed the presence of a band corresponding to a homodimeric state of the protein, unlike that of rCFP32 produced in E. coli. Computational modeling indicates that a single cysteine residue at position 193 of each monomer might bond to stabilize the homodimeric state of CFP32. Computational study showed that this residue is buried inside the protein core of E. coli-produced rCFP32 suggesting that rCFP32 may adopt a different folding in P. pastoris and BCG, in which C193 is solvent exposed. Surprisingly, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a generated monoclonal antibody (14D4) reveals the presence of a differential epitope that appears to be the consequence of the protein dimerization of the yeast- and BCG-, but not E.coli- produced, CFP32 recombinant form. We conclude that, in addition to N-glycosylation, homodimeric folding significantly enhances the immunoreactivity of rCFP32 and may these post-translational modifications may factor into the structure and function of native M. tuberculosis CFP32.</p></details></div>

A linear cationic hybrid peptide, LL-37Talpha1 was derived from two parental peptides (LL-37 and Talpha1) recognized as potent anti-endotoxin without any hemolytic or cytotoxic activity. We successfully cloned the gene of hybrid peptide LL-37Talpha1 in PpICZalphaA vector and expressed in the Pichia pastoris. The recombinant peptide was purified by Ni-affinity column and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with an estimated molecular mass of 3.9 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. We analyzed the LPS neutralization by limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) activity and the results indicate that the hybrid peptide LL-37Talpha1 directly binds endotoxin and significantly (p < 0.05) neutralizes the effect of LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay revealed that LL-37Talpha1 successfully reduces the LPS-induced cytotoxicity in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, it significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the levels of nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and diminished the number of apoptotic cells in LPS-stimulated mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Our results suggest that the P. pastoris expression system is cost-effective for commercial production of the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory hybrid peptide (IAHP) LL-37Talpha1 and the peptide may serve as effective anti-endotoxin/anti-inflammatory agent with minimal cytotoxicity.</p></details></div>

The hydrolyzation products from these substrates were detected by thin-layer chromatography as oligosaccharides with minimal disaccharides. These results suggested that T. matsutake produces a typical endoglucanase in solid-state culture, and the fungus has the potential to degrade beta-linkage polysaccharides.</p></details></div>

A new thermo-stable feruloyl esterase gene, TtfaeB was identified from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris h408. Deduced protein sequence shares the identity of 67% with FAEB from Neurospora crassa. The expression vector pPIC9K-TtfaeB was successfully constructed and electro-transformed into GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. One transformant with high feruloyl esterase yield was obtained through plate screening and named TtFAEB1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of fermentation supernatant from transformant TtFAEB1 showed a distinct protein band appearing at the position of about 35-kDa, indicating that TtfaeB gene has been successfully expressed in P. pastoris. The recombinant TtFAEB was purified by affinity chromatography and the specific activity of purified TtFAEB was 6.06 +/- 0.72 U/mg. The optimal temperature and pH for purified recombinant TtFAEB was 60 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. TtFAEB was thermostable, retaining 96.89 and 84.16% of the maximum activity after being treated for 1 h at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the enzyme was stable in the pH range 4.5-8.0. The homology model of TtFAEB showed that it consists of a single domain adopting a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser117, Asp201, and His260. TtFAEB in association with xylanase from Trichoderma reesei could release 77.1% of FA from destarched wheat bran. The present results indicated that the recombinant TtFAEB with excellent enzymatic properties is a promising candidate for potential applications in biomass deconstruction and biorefinery.</p></details></div>

This research reported a glycosyl hydrolase (Tk-ChiA) form T. Kodakarensis with dual hydrolytic activity due to the presence of three binding domains with affinity toward chitin and cellulose. The Tk-ChiA gene was cloned and expressed on Pichia pastoris GS115. The molecular weight of the purified Tk-ChiA is about 130.0 kDa. By using chitosan, CMC-Na and other polysaccharides as substrates, we confirmed that Tk-ChiA with dual hydrolysis activity preferably hydrolyzes both chitosan and CMC-Na. Purified Tk-ChiA showed maximal activity for hydrolyzing CMC-Na at temperature 65 degrees C and pH 7.0. It showed thermal stability on incubation for 4 h at temperatures ranging from 70 to 80 degrees C and remained more than 40% of its maximum activity after pre-incubation at 100 degrees C for 4 h. Particularly, Tk-ChiA is capable of degrading shrimp shell and rice straw through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The main factors affecting shell and straw degradation were determined to be reaction time and temperature; and both factors were optimized by central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) to enhance the efficiency of degradation. Our findings suggest that Tk-ChiA with dual thermostable hydrolytic activities maybe a promising hydrolase for shell and straw waste treatment, conversion, and utilization.</p></details></div>

Its ability to produce phase I (oxidative) metabolites of drugs is associated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity; however, almost nothing is known about these enzymes in the fungus. In this paper we report the in silico analysis of the genome sequence of C. elegans B9769, which contains 32 genes putatively coding for CYPs. Based on their predicted amino acid sequences these were classified as belonging to CYP509, 5203, 5208, 5313, 5210, 61 and 51 families. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed that the gene coding for CYP5313D1 was significantly upregulated when C. elegans DSM1908 was cultivated in sabouraud dextrose in contrast to its expression in cells grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium. This corresponded to the fungus' xenobiotic biotransformation ability when grown in the two media. Heterologous expression of cyp5313D1 in Pichia pastoris resulted in a recombinant strain that biotransformed flurbiprofen to 4'-hydroxyflurbiprofen, the same metabolite generated by C. elegans cultures.

In human, multiple diseases are associated with malfunction of these organelles, which causes accumulation of ROS species and consequently the inefficient detoxification of cells. Despite intense research, much remains to be clarified about the precise molecular role of catalase in cellular homeostasis. Yeast peroxisomes and their peroxisomal catalases have been used as eukaryotic models for oxidative metabolism, ROS generation and detoxification, and associated pathologies. In order to provide reliable models for oxidative metabolism research, we have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of peroxisomal catalase from two important biotechnology and basic biology yeast models, Pichia pastoris and Kluyveromyces lactis. We have performed an extensive functional, biochemical and stability characterization of both enzymes in order to establish their differential activity profiles. Furthermore, we have analyzed the role of the peroxisomal catalase under study in the survival of yeast to oxidative burst challenges combining methanol, water peroxide, and sodium chloride. Interestingly, whereas catalase activity was induced 200-fold upon challenging the methylotrophic P. pastoris cells with methanol, the increase in catalase activity in the non-methylotrophic K. lactis was only moderate. The inhibitory effect of sodium azide and beta-mercaptoethanol over both catalases was analyzed, establishing IC50 values for both compounds that are consistent with an elevated resistance of both enzymes toward these inhibitors. Structural comparison of these two novel catalase structures allows us to rationalize the differential susceptibility to inhibitors and oxidative bursts. The inherent worth and validity of the P. pastoris and K. lactis yeast models for oxidative damage will be strengthened by the availability of reliable structural-functional information on these enzymes, which are central to our understanding of peroxisomal response toward oxidative stress.</p></details></div>

The NEPVs were designed by engineering of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) determined by in silico analyses and manual curation systematically, by (a) single-handedly replacement of specified TFBSs with synthetic motifs for Mxr1, Cat8, and Aca1 binding, and synthetic TATA-box integration; and, (b) nucleosome optimization. PADH2-Cat8-L2 and PADH2-Cat8-L1 designed by the integration of synthetic Cat8 binding sites were superior, and then PADH2-NucOpt . Compared to that with PADH2 at t = 20 hr of the fermentations, PADH2-Cat8-L2 allowed the highest increase in enhanced green fluorescent protein expression as 4.8-fold on ethanol and 3.8-fold on methanol; and, PADH2-NucOpt upregulated the expression 1.5-fold on ethanol and enhanced 3.2-fold on methanol. Using the superior two tools, Cat8-L2 and NucOpt, we designed PADH2-NucOpt-Cat8-L2 . With PADH2-NucOpt-Cat8-L2 , the expression in the fermentation of ethanol was upregulated 3.7-fold that is distinctly higher than that with PADH2-NucOpt but lower than that with PADH2-Cat8-L2 ; while on methanol compared to that with PADH2 , the expression was enhanced 8.8-fold. Extracellular recombinant human serum albumin production was also studied with PADH2-Cat8-L2 and PADH2-NucOpt , and average recombinant human serum albumin yield (YP/X ) on ethanol was 1.13 and 0.38 mg/gWCW, respectively; whereas with PADH2 , YP/X was 0.26 mg/gWCW . We conclude that as upregulation of transcription and enhanced expression correlate with the sequence of synthetic motifs and their location in the hybrid-promoter architectures of NEPVs in coordination with trans-acting factors, which are the design parameters in the engineering of binding sites; the NEPVs generated promising recombinant protein production platforms with a high impact on industrial scale production processes, as well as would open up new avenues for research in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

In this regard, Pichia pastoris has become one of the most attractive host platforms for large-scale production of xylanases. However, genomic engineering is still required for overexpression and efficient secretion. In this paper, we applied droplet-based method to screen directed evolved extracellular xylanase producing P. pastoris strain. Xylanase-producing P. pastoris cells were encapsulated in gel microdroplets with a fluorogenic reporter substrate. Improved production of xylanase increases fluorescence intensity of gel microdroplets, enabled accurate selection of evolved clones by droplet sorting. The screening strategy was validated by identifying yeast with improved xylanase production from a mixed sample with a positive selection accuracy of up to 98%. After three rounds of mutagenesis and selection, approximately 10(8) variants were screened, and a P. pastoris clone with more than 1.3-fold increase in xylanase activity was identified, representing cellular functions improvement of the production host. The throughput of this approach was at least 10(3)-fold higher than that of the robot-assisted microtiter plate reader, and reagent consumption was reduced by approximately 10(6)-fold. Furthermore, the greatly shortened incubation time prior screening significantly accelerated the process of directed evolution.</p></details></div>

We previously produced a full-length single chain recombinant yellowtail kingfish FSH using the Pichia pastoris expression system. We used the same method to produce the beta subunit of the hormone, against which polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits. We first confirmed immunoreactivity of the polyclonal antibodies with the recombinant full length FSH and FSHbeta as well as plasma and pituitary FSH of sexually immature and mature yellowtail kingfish by Western blot analysis. We then developed a precise and reproducible ELISA for yellowtail kingfish FSH and validated the assay in plasma and pituitary extracts. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation was <2.2% and 10.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay was 78pg/ml. For further validation of the assay, we measured the plasma FSH in immature yellowtail kingfish treated with increasing doses (blank, 50, 100 and 150microg/kg) of kisseptin2-10 peptide from a previous study. The dose response observed in treated females was not significant, however the increased plasma FSH levels coincided with the significantly higher estradiol levels we previously reported in the treated groups. We assessed the applicability of the assay in measuring circulating FSH in other species. We observed parallelism between the linearized FSH standard curve and displacement curves of serially diluted plasma from Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). We also observed similar parallelism with full length recombinant giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) FSH.

To elucidate this hypothesis, in this study, firstly we demonstrated that rLcc9 and nLcc9 were glycoproteins, and then enzymatically deglycosylated them. The obtained drLcc9 and dnLcc9 showed an apparent decrease in their specific activities. Three putative N-glycosylation sites (N293, N313, and N454) were then predicted in Lcc9 and substituted to evaluate their roles in its specific activity. Molecular weight analysis on those mutants suggested that glycosylation should have occurred on N313 and N454 whereas not on N293 in rLcc9. Comparison of catalytic properties of those mutants revealed that glycosylation at N313 and N454 in rLcc9 could affect the binding affinity to substrates and the catalytic rate, respectively. In addition, the glycosylation could also affect the thermal stability of rLcc9 and nLcc9 since deglycosylation of those Lcc9s resulted in decreases in their thermal stability to some extent. These results will help us to understand the effect of glycosylation on biochemical characteristics of fungal laccases, and provide us support for the improvement of fungal laccase activity based on N-linked glycosylation modification.</p></details></div>

The use of such an approach is restricted by how well a targeted polypeptide can be efficiently ligated. Recently, an Asx-specific peptide ligase identified from a tropical cyclotide-producing plant and named butelase 1 exhibited excellent cyclization kinetics that cannot be matched by other known ligases, including intein, PATG, PCY1, and sortase A. In this work, we aimed to examine whether butelase 1 facilitated protein conformational stability for structural investigation. First, we successfully expressed recombinant butelase 1 (rBTase) in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Next, rBTase was shown to be highly efficient in the cyclization of the p53-binding domain (N-terminal domain) of murine double minute X (N-MdmX), an important target for designing anticancer drugs. The cyclized N-MdmX (cMdmX) exhibited increased conformational stability and improved interaction with the ligand compared with those of noncyclized N-MdmX. Importantly, the thermal melting process was completely reversible, contrary to noncyclized N-MdmX, and the melting temperature ( Tm) of cMdmX was increased to 47 from 43 degrees C. This stable conformation of cMdmX was further confirmed by (15)N-(1)H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The complex of cMdmX and the ligand was tested for protein crystallization, and several promising findings were revealed. Therefore, our work not only provides a recombinant version of butelase 1 but also suggests a conventional approach for preparing stable protein samples for both protein crystallization and NMR structural investigation.</p></details></div>

AGT is specifically cleaved by renin to produce angiotensin-I, the first product of the angiotensin-processing cascade. Ovine angiotensinogen (oAGT) is considered an effective substrate for human renin and consequently finds application in clinical renin assays. In this study, oAGT was cloned into the genome of Pichia pastoris and expressed under the control of alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter for high-level production. Compared to the shake flask study, the high cell density cultivation in bioreactor resulted in multifold increase in oAGT titer (420 +/- 9.26 mg/L), which is its highest reported titer to date. We purified recombinant oAGT to homogeneity using two chromatography steps. The characterization studies revealed oAGT underwent a two-state transition during thermal denaturation process as assessed by differential scanning fluorimetry, and the melting temperature (Tm ) of the purified oAGT from P. pastoris was 48.3 degrees C. Renin reactivity with recombinant oAGT from P. pastoris (0.51 nM angiotensin-I/min) was slightly lower than the renin reactivity for recombinant oAGT from Escherichia coli (0.67 nM angiotensin-I/min), possibly because of its mannosylated N-glycan content. Enhanced production of functionally active recombinant oAGT using P. pastoris expression system reported in this study envisage the effective utilization of oAGT in clinical studies related to renin in near future.</p></details></div>

It was found that no CGTase was expressed using traditional defined medium (basal salt medium [BSM]) because of pH value decreasing significantly. CGTase was expressed by recombinant K. phaffii through pH maintenance in range of 5.5-7.0. beta-CGTase activity increased to 122.0 U/mL after optimization of glycerol, phosphate buffer, pH value, ammonium sulfate, temperature, methanol, and additives based on BSM, establishing a modified defined medium.

The clinical outcome of the approved recombinant human IFN alpha2b drugs in the market suffers from short plasma half-life, rapid clearance and other side effects. Human IFN alpha2b expression in mammalian cell lines results in significant heterogeneity in glycan moieties, inconsistent product quality and high production cost. Potential scope exists for the design and development of a successful expression platform for enhanced human IFN alpha2b production with improved pharmacokinetic property. Glycoengineering strategy was employed to construct IFN alpha2b with potential N-glycosylation site to evade the drawbacks of approved recombinant human IFN alpha2b drugs. Heterogeneity of glycosylation and hypermannosylation in the wild-type strains of Pichia pastoris was circumvented by employing glycoengineered strain (SuperMan5) to produce glycosylated IFN alpha2b with human type N-glycans. Recombinant SuperMan5 strain expressed human type N-glycosylated IFN alpha2b with greater homogeneity elucidated by glycan analysis (MALDI-TOF/MS). The purified glycosylated IFN alpha2b was biologically active, inhibiting the viral replication of HCV and HEV at 85% and 66%, respectively.

The advantages of using hydrocyclone in biomass separation could be summarized in its suitability for continuous separation and its low risk of contamination. To evaluate the performance of hydrocyclone, concentration ratio in underflow to feed stream, capacity, and centrifugal force by considering three parameters of pressure drop, concentration, and the type of hydrocyclone were investigated. Using three level factorial design a concentration ratio equation was developed, with the correlation coefficient R(2) = 0.977 ensured the good fitness of the predicted data with the experimental results. In optimal conditions, maximum concentration ratio was 1.246, for flow rate 13.5 LPM and C-force equal to 1276.11 at maximum pressure drop (3 bar) and minimum concentration (0.5% w/w) in hydrocyclone 1.

For this purpose, in large-scale fed-batch fermentation, using methanol for HBsAg induction and cell growth, three parameters of average specific growth rate, biomass yield, and dry biomass concentration-in the definite integral form with respect to fermentation time-were selected as input vectors; the final concentration of HBsAg was selected for the ANN output.

For the generation of knockouts in the industrially important yeast Pichia pastoris, several protocols have been published to date. Nevertheless, creating a targeted knockout in P. pastoris still is a time-consuming process, as the existing protocols are labour-intensive and/or prone to accumulate nucleotide mutations. In this study, we introduce a novel, user-friendly vector-based system for the generation of targeted knockouts in P. pastoris. Upon confirming the successful knockout, respective selection markers can easily be recycled. Excision of the marker is mediated by Flippase (Flp) recombinase and occurs at high frequency (>/=95%). We validated our knockout system by deleting 20 (confirmed and putative) protease genes and five genes involved in biosynthetic pathways. For the first time, we describe gene deletions of PRO3 and PHA2 in P. pastoris, genes involved in proline and phenylalanine biosynthesis, respectively. Unexpectedly, knockout strains of PHA2 did not display the anticipated auxotrophy for phenylalanine, but rather showed a bradytroph phenotype on minimal medium hinting at an alternative but less efficient pathway for production of phenylalanine exists in P. pastoris. Overall, all knockout vectors can easily be adapted to the gene of interest and strain background by efficient exchange of target homology regions and selection markers in single cloning steps. Average knockout efficiencies for all 25 genes were shown to be 40%, which is comparably high.</p></details></div>

However, episomal plasmids for heterologous gene expression and the CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome editing have not been well developed in P. pastoris. In the present study, a panel of episomal plasmids containing various autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) were constructed and their performance in transformation efficiency, copy numbers, and propagation stability were systematically compared. Among the five ARSs with different origins, panARS isolated from Kluyveromyces lactis was determined to have the best performance and used to develop an efficient CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing system. Compared with a previously reported system using the endogenous and most commonly used ARS (PARS1), the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing efficiency was increased for more than tenfold. Owing to the higher plasmid stability with panARS, efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing with a type III promoter (i.e. SER promoter) to drive the expression of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) was achieved for the first time.

Evaluation of different induction strategies indicated that it was possible to increase Pgp expression by inducing the culture with 20% media containing 2.5% methanol. By quantifying methanol, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and formate, and by measuring alcohol oxidase, catalase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases, it was possible to correlate Pgp expression to the induction strategy. Inducing the culture by adding methanol with fresh media was associated with decreases in formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, and increases in formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases. At these conditions, Pgp expression was 1400-fold higher, an indication that Pgp expression is affected by increases in formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. It is possible that Pgp is responsible for this behaviour, since the increased metabolite concentrations and decreased enzymatic activities were not observed when parental Pichia was subjected to the same growth conditions.

However, thrombin-like serine proteases differ from thrombin by being unable to activate factor XIII, thus leading to the formation of loose clots and fibrinogen consumption. We report the functional and biological characterization of a recombinant thrombin-like serine protease from Crotalus durissus collilineatus, named rCollinein-1. Methods: Heterologous expression of rCollinein-1 was performed in Pichia pastoris system according to a previously standardized protocol, with some modifications. rCollinein-1 was purified from the culture medium by a combination of three chromatographic steps. The recombinant toxin was tested in vitro for its thrombolytic activity and in mice for its edematogenicity, blood incoagulability and effect on plasma proteins. Results: When tested for the ability to induce mouse paw edema, rCollinein-1 demonstrated low edematogenic effect, indicating little involvement of this enzyme in the inflammatory processes resulting from ophidian accidents. The rCollinein-1 did not degrade blood clots in vitro, which suggests that this toxin lacks fibrinolytic activity and is not able to directly or indirectly activate the fibrinolytic system. The minimal dose of rCollinein-1 that turns the blood incoagulable in experimental mice is 7.5 mg/kg. The toxin also led to a significant increase in activated partial thromboplastin time at the dose of 1 mg/kg in the animals. Other parameters such as plasma fibrinogen concentration and prothrombin time were not significantly affected by treatment with rCollinein-1 at this dose. The toxin was also able to alter plasma proteins in mouse after 3 h of injection at a dose of 1 mg/kg, leading to a decrease in the intensity of beta zone and an increase in gamma zone in agarose gel electrophoresis. Conclusion: These results suggest that the recombinant enzyme has no potential as a thrombolytic agent but can be applied in the prevention of thrombus formation in some pathological processes and as molecular tools in studies related to hemostasis.</p></details></div>

Compared with the normally spliced transcript bgl1A, bgl1B had an extra 51bp insertion, which was confirmed to be the sixth (the last) intron of this beta-glucosidase gene. The bgl1A and bgl1B were expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified enzymes were used to compare their catalytic properties. The results showed that the intron retention didn't impair the catalytic function. Instead, the intron-retained enzyme BGL1B had a better thermostability with a higher optimal temperature and a longer half-life under 50 degrees C.

After the magnetic separation, the sample loading in SDS gel shows a reduction in protein band and the protein absorption at a wavelength of 280nm. Finally, we evaluate the ability of amine functionalized nanoparticles for protein separation that demonstrate the adsorption capacity significantly increased compare with silica-coated nanoparticles. The amine functionalized nanoparticles provide the maximum adsorption capacity of 235.21mug/mg and after the elution, protein concentration determined 476mg/L. This work indicates the functionalized magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles can be used as the best candidate for the separation of different biological macromolecules.</p></details></div>

Pharmacologic inhibition of factor XII is an attractive alternative in providing protection from pathologic thrombus formation while minimizing hemorrhagic risk. Large quantity of recombinant active factor XII is required for screening inhibitors and further research. In the present study, we designed and expressed the recombinant serine protease domain of factor XII in Pichia pastoris strain X-33, which is a eukaryotic expression model organism with low cost. The purification protocol was simplified and the protein yield was high (~20 mg/L medium). The purified serine protease domain of factor XII behaved homogeneously as a monomer, exhibited comparable activity with the human betaFXIIa, and accelerated clot formation in human plasma.

The efficient utilization and complete hydrolysis of xylans necessitate the understanding of the mode of action of xylan degrading enzymes. The glycoside hydrolase family 30 (GH30) xylanases comprise a less studied group of such enzymes, and differences regarding the substrate recognition have been reported between fungal and bacterial GH30 xylanases. Besides their role in the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for bioenergy, such enzymes could be used for the tailored production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides (XOS) due to their substrate specificity. Results: The expression of a putative GH30_7 xylanase from the fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila (synonyms Myceliophthora thermophila, Sporotrichum thermophile) in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production and isolation of a novel xylanase with unique catalytic properties. The novel enzyme designated TtXyn30A, exhibited an endo- mode of action similar to that of bacterial GH30 xylanases that require 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) decorations, in contrast to most characterized fungal ones. However, TtXyn30A also exhibited an exo-acting catalytic behavior by releasing the disaccharide xylobiose from the non-reducing end of XOS. The hydrolysis products from beechwood glucuronoxylan were MeGlcA substituted XOS, and xylobiose. The major uronic XOS (UXOS) were the aldotriuronic and aldotetrauronic acid after longer incubation indicating the ability of TtXyn30A to cleave linear parts of xylan and UXOS as well. Conclusions: Hereby, we reported the heterologous production and biochemical characterization of a novel fungal GH30 xylanase exhibiting endo- and exo-xylanase activity. To date, considering its novel catalytic properties, TtXyn30A shows differences with most characterized fungal and bacterial GH30 xylanases. The discovered xylobiohydrolase mode of action offers new insights into fungal enzymatic systems that are employed for the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. The recombinant xylanase could be used for the production of X2 and UXOS from glucuronoxylan, which in turn would be utilized as prebiotics carrying manifold health benefits.</p></details></div>

The FDA-approved thrombolytics such as Tissue Plasminogen Activator, Streptokinase etc. are used to lyse the clots in thrombotic disorders such as myocardial infarction, stroke etc. but re-occlusion and bleeding that are co-incident to their clinical usage are not addressed. Hence, there is need to develop thrombolytics having properties like increased fibrin clot specificity and thrombin inhibition capability to prevent re-occlusion. In the present work, a fusion protein construct containing two components i.e. Staphylokinase (SAK) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) 4, 5, 6-like domains of human thrombomodulin (THBD) was expressed in Pichia pastoris after genetic optimization. SAK isolated from Staphylococcus aureus is a fibrin-specific plasminogen activator while EGF 4, 5, 6-like domains are reported to be responsible for imparting thrombin inhibition to human thrombomodulin, and therefore, expected could help prevent re-occlusion in the novel construct - SAK_EGF, which is a 43kDa protein. After expression, it was purified (approx. 13-fold) using two-step purification protocol involving ion-exchange followed by Gel Filtration Chromatography (GFC). The functional characterization including plasminogen activation and thrombin inhibition showed that both the fusion partners viz. SAK and 4,5,6 EGF-like domains retained their respective activities after fusion, confirming it to be a bio-active construct. Thus, this engineered protein could be clinically promising due to the combinatorial effect of fibrin-specific thrombus lysis and prevention of re-occulusion.</p></details></div>

In the present study, we have aimed to understand the effect of two natural variants of HSA, such as Herborn (K240E) and Milano Slow (D375H) on the binding of phenylbutazone and ibuprofen. For this, we have generated K240E and D375H mutants and also double mutant (K240E/D375H) of HSA using site directed mutagenesis. The recombinant HSA and its variants were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The interaction of HSA and its variants to phenylbutazone and ibuprofen was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results showed that there is no significant effect of K240E and D375H mutations on phenylbutazone and ibuprofen binding. But the effect is significant when both the mutations were there in a single protein (K240E/D375H). Further, the CD spectroscopy data showed that there is no effect of phenylbutazone and ibuprofen binding on the conformation of protein, except in case of D375H, where there is a conformational change in the binding pocket with the ibuprofen binding.</p></details></div>

ZIKV is a neurotropic virus capable of causing congenital neurodevelopmental birth defects. As ZIKV antibodies (Abs) can potentially enhance infection by DENVs, a preventive ZIKV vaccine must be designed to eliminate antibody dependent enhancement of infection. We developed a Zika Subunit Vaccine (ZSV) consisting of two proteins, ZS and S, in a genetically pre-determined ratio of 1:4, using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. ZS is an in-frame fusion of ZIKV envelope domain III with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, and S is the un-fused HBV surface antigen. Using specific monoclonal Abs we showed the presence of ZS and S in the co-purified material which were found to co-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), based on dynamic light scattering and electron microscopic analyses. These VLPs were immunogenic in BALB/c mice, eliciting Abs capable of neutralizing ZIKV reporter virus particles. Further, the VLP-induced Abs did not enhance a sub-lethal DENV-2 challenge in AG129 mice. This important safety feature, coupled to the well-documented advantage of P. pastoris expression system, warrants further exploration of ZSV VLP as a possible vaccine candidate.</p></details></div>

We describe a combined method using screening and in silico algorithms for ranking chromatographic steps to rapidly design orthogonally selective integrated processes for purifying protein therapeutics from both process- and product-related impurities. IFN-alpha2b produced in Pichia pastoris containing a significant product variant challenge was used as a case study. The product and product-related variants were screened on a set of 14 multimodal, ion exchange, and hydrophobic charge induction chromatography resins under various pH and salt linear gradient conditions. Data generated from reversed-phase chromatography of the fractions collected were used to generate a retention database for IFN-alpha2b and its variants. These data, in combination with a previously constructed process-related impurity database for P. pastoris, were input into an in silico process development tool that generated and ranked all possible integrated chromatographic sequences for their ability to remove both process and product-related impurities. Top-ranking outputs guided the experimental refinement of two successful three step purification processes, one comprising all bind-elute steps and the other having two bind-elute steps and a flowthrough operation. This approach suggests a new platform-like approach for rapidly designing purification processes for a range of proteins where separations of both process- and product-related impurities are needed.</p></details></div>

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the biochemical and structural properties of recombinant NS1 (rNS1) vary depending on the protein expression system used. Aiming to improve current tools for studying NS1 multiple roles, a recombinant tag-free NS1 protein was expressed and purified from P. pastoris yeast cells. The best expression condition was achieved using GS115 strain and induction for 72h with 0.7% methanol addition every 24h. Total secreted rNS1 reached 2.18mg in 1L culture and the final yield of the purified protein was 1mg per liter of culture (recovery yield of approximately 45.9%). Size-exclusion chromatography and treatment with EndoH and PNGase indicate that it exists as an N-glycosylated homodimer. Moreover, an ELISA assay with specific DENV anti-NS1 antibody that recognizes conformational epitopes revealed that rNS1 has most of its conformational epitopes preserved. The expression of rNS1 in its native conformation is an important tool for further studies of its role in DENV pathogenesis and replication.</p></details></div>

The cellobiohydrolase from Lentinula edodes (LeCel7A) was produced in Pichia pastoris. The optimal temperature and pH for LeCel7A were 60 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The recombinant protein enhanced the hydrolysis of three straws. During in vitro rumen fermentation of three straws, the fiber digestibility, concentration of acetate and total volatile fatty acids, and fermentation liquid microbial protein were increased by LeCel7A. High throughput sequencing and real-time PCR data showed that the effects of LeCel7A on ruminal microbial community depended on the fermentation substrates. The relative abundances of Prevotellaceae_UCG_003 and Saccharofermentans were increased by LeCel7A regardless of agricultural straws. With rice straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Desulfovibrio, Ruminococcaceae and its some genus. With wheat straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus.

The use of glucose as a carbon source in the growth phase led to a remarkable increase in cell size compared with glycerol, while the smallest cells were obtained with sucrose likely due to the occurrence of an energetic stress. The scFv concentration seemed to be related to cell number rather than to cell concentration, which in its turn showed no significant dependence on the carbon source. Yeast cells grown on sucrose had a mean diameter (0.736 +/- 0.097 mum) about 35% shorter than those grown on glucose and allowed for the highest final concentration of the scFv antibody fragment (93.7 +/- 0.2 mg/L).

This study aims to improve on the characterization of a thermostable Aspergillus fumigatus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase GH7 (Af-EGL7). To this end, Af-EGL7 was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were estimated and suggested a robust enzyme. The recombinant protein was highly stable within an extreme pH range (3.0-8.0) and was highly thermostable at 55 degrees C for 72 h. Low Cu(2+) concentrations (0.1-1.0 mM) stimulated Af-EGL7 activity up to 117%. Af-EGL7 was tolerant to inhibition by products, such as glucose and cellobiose. Glucose at 50 mM did not inhibit Af-EGL7 activity, whereas 50 mM cellobiose inhibited Af-EGL7 activity by just 35%. Additionally, the Celluclast((R)) 1.5L cocktail supplemented with Af-EGL7 provided improved hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse "in natura", sugarcane exploded bagasse (SEB), corncob, rice straw, and bean straw.

Therefore, searching for more effective compounds to reduce the toxicity of treatments, while still producing similar effects as current chemotherapy regimens, is required. Currently, the search for potential anticancer agents involves a random, inaccurate process with strategic deficits and a lack of specific targets. For this reason, the initial in vitro highthroughput steps in the screening process should be reviewed for rapid identification of the compounds that may serve as anticancer agents. The present study aimed to investigate the potential use of the Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H expressing DNA topoisomerase I (SMD1168HTOPOI) in a yeastbased assay for screening potential anticancer agents. The cell density that indicated the growth of the recombinant yeast without treatment was first measured by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the effects of glutamate (agonist) and camptothecin (antagonist) on the recombinant yeast cell density were investigated using the same approach, and finally, the effect of camptothecin on various cell lines was determined and compared with its effect on recombinant yeast. The current study demonstrated that growth was enhanced in SMD1168HTOPOI as compared with that in SMD1168H. Glutamate also enhanced the growth of the SMD1168H; however, the growth effect was not enhanced in SMD1168HTOPOI treated with glutamate. By contrast, camptothecin caused only lower cell density and growth throughout the treatment of SMD1168HTOPOI. The findings of the current study indicated that SMD1168HTOPOI has similar characteristics to MDAMB231 cells; therefore, it can be used in a yeastbased assay to screen for more effective compounds that may inhibit the growth of highly metastatic breast cancer cells.</p></details></div>

High performance anion exchange chromatography and mass spectrometry confirmed that purified protein was active against an array of cellulosic (avicel, carboxy methyl cellulose) and hemicellulosic (birch wood xylan, wheat arabinoxylan and rye arabinoxylan) substrates, releasing both oxidized and unoxidized cello-oligosaccharide and xylo-oligosaccharide products respectively.

Human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) is an important pharmaceutical protein, playing a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of innate immune cells. In this study, a methanol-free expression platform for extracellular expression of hGM-CSF was developed. To attain this goal, a novel constructed expression vector pEP(alpha)101, carrying the FMD promoter regulating recombinant expression by glycerol derepression was designed.

A C-terminally truncated E(rns) recombinant protein lacking the previously identified heparin-binding domain (HBD) bound to heparin column, suggesting the presence of another HBD in CSFV E(rns). Sequence analyses of the CSFV E(rns) coding region revealed a common potential N-terminal HBD at residues 301311.

In the present study, we present a series of experiments aiming to validate and apply an original high-tech implantable device, consisting of the coupling, for the first time, of an amperometric biosensor for brain ethanol detection, with a sensor for detecting the microvibrations of the animal. This device allows the real-time comparison between the ethanol intake, its cerebral concentrations, and their effect on the motion when the animal is in the condition of voluntary drinking. To this end, we assessed in vitro the efficiency of three different biosensor designs loading diverse alcohol oxidase enzymes (AOx) obtained from three different AOx-donor strains: Hansenula polymorpha, Candida boidinii, and Pichia pastoris. In vitro data disclosed that the devices loading H. polymorpha and C. boidinii were similarly efficient (respectively, linear region slope [LRS]: 1.98 +/- 0.07 and 1.38 +/- 0.04 nA/mM) but significantly less than the P. pastoris-loaded one (</p><p><strong>LRS:</strong> 7.57 +/- 0.12 nA/mM). The in vivo results indicate that this last biosensor design detected the rise of ethanol in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) after 15 minutes of voluntary 10% ethanol solution intake. At the same time, the microvibration sensor detected a significant increase in the rat's motion signal. Notably, both the biosensor and microvibration sensor described similar and parallel time-dependent U-shaped curves, thus providing a highly sensitive and time-locked high-resolution detection of the neurochemical and behavioral kinetics upon voluntary ethanol intake. The results overall indicate that such a dual telemetry unit represents a powerful device which, implanted in different brain areas, may boost further investigations on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie ethanol-induced motor activity and reward.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a C1qDC with a collagen-like domain (designated CgC1qDC-6) was identified from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and its possible involvement in immune responses was also characterized.

CgC1qDC-6 was clustered with the C1qDCs from several mollusks in the phylogenetic tree. CgC1qDC-6 was detected at both mRNA and protein levels in all tested tissues including hepatopancreas, gonad, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, and hemocytes.

Fungal defensin-like peptides (DLPs) are emerging as a potential source of new antibacterial drugs due to their potent antibacterial activity. In this study, nine novel fungal DLPs were firstly identified by querying against UniProt databases and expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their antibacterial and anti-biofilm ability were tested against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus. Results showed that among them, P2, the highest activity and expression level, showed low toxicity, no resistance, and high stability. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of P2 against Gram-positive bacteria were < 2 mug/mL. P2 exhibited the potent activity against intracellular MDR S. aureus (bacterial reduction in 80-97%) in RAW264.7 macrophages. P2 bound to/disrupted bacterial DNA, wrinkled outer membranes and permeabilized cytoplasmic membranes, but maintained the integrity of bacterial cells. P2 inhibited/eradicated the biofilm and killed 99% persister bacteria, which were resistant to 100x MIC vancomycin. P2 upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha/IL-1beta) and chemokine (MCP-1) levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages and in mice, respectively. Five milligram per kilogram P2 enhanced the survival of S. aureus-infected mice (100%), superior to vancomycin (30 mg/kg), inhibited the bacterial translocation, and alleviated multiple-organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney, and lung). These data suggest that P2 may be a candidate for novel antimicrobial agents against MDR staphylococcal infections.</p></details></div>

This trend is mostly met by the use of artificial non-nutritive sweeteners. However, these sweeteners have also been proven to have adverse health effects such as dizziness, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, and mood changes for aspartame. One of the solutions lies in the commercialization of sweet proteins, which are not associated with adverse health effects. Of these proteins, thaumatin is one of the most studied and most promising alternatives for sugars and artificial sweeteners. Since the natural production of these proteins is often too expensive, biochemical production methods are currently under investigation. With these methods, recombinant DNA technology is used for the production of sweet proteins in a host organism. The most promising host known today is the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. This yeast has a tightly regulated methanol-induced promotor, allowing a good control over the recombinant protein production. Great efforts have been undertaken for improving the yields and purities of thaumatin productions, but a further optimization is still desired. This review focuses on (i) the motivation for using and producing sweet proteins, (ii) the properties and history of thaumatin, (iii) the production of recombinant sweet proteins, and (iv) future possibilities for process optimization based on a systems biology approach.</p></details></div>

Rapid results, small-volume reactions, irrelevance of protein toxicity, flexibility, and openness of the system are strong points in favor of the cell-free system. However, the in vitro situation lacks the cellular quality control machinery comprising e.g., the translocon for inserting membrane proteins into lipid bilayers, and chaperon-assisted protein degradation pathways. Here, we compare yield and protein quality of the lactate transporter, PfFNT, from malaria parasites when produced in Pichia pastoris yeast, or in an Escherichia coli S30-extract-based cell-free system. Besides solubilization and correct folding, PfFNT requires oligomerization into homopentamers. We assessed PfFNT folding/oligomerization and function by transmission electron microscopy imaging, transport assays, and binding of small-molecule inhibitors. For the latter, we used chromatography of the PfFNT-inhibitor complex with dual-wavelength detection, and biolayer interferometry. Our data show, that PfFNT possesses an intrinsic capability for assuming the correct fold, oligomerization pattern, and functionality during in vitro translation. This competence depended on the detergent present in the cell-free reaction. The choice of detergent further affected purification and inhibitor binding. In conclusion, in the presence of a suitable detergent, cell-free systems are very well capable of producing high quality membrane proteins.</p></details></div>

Drugs are useful against hookworm infections, but hookworms rapidly reinfect people, and the parasites can develop drug resistance.

METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> We investigated the vaccine efficacy in outbred Syrian hamsters of three A. ceylanicum hookworm antigen candidates from two classes of proteins previously identified as promising vaccine candidates. These include two intestinally-enriched, putatively secreted cathepsin B cysteine proteases (AceyCP1, AceyCPL) and one small Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (AceySKPI3). Recombinant proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris, and adsorbed to Alhydrogel. Recombinant AceyCPL (rAceyCPL)/Alhydrogel and rAceySKPI3/Alhydrogel induced high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in 8/8 vaccinates, but were not protective. rAceyCP1/Alhydrogel induced intermediate serum IgG titers in ~60% of vaccinates in two different trials. rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had highly significantly decreased hookworm burdens, fecal egg counts and clinical pathology compared to Alhydrogel controls and nonresponders. Protection was highly correlated with rAceyCP1 serum IgG titer. Antisera from rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders, but not nonresponders or rAceyCPL/Alhydrogel vaccinates, significantly reduced adult A. ceylanicum motility in vitro.

In yeasts, pexophagy depends mostly on the pexophagy receptors, such as Atg30 for Pichia pastoris and Atg36 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the autophagy scaffold proteins, Atg11 and Atg17, and the core autophagy machinery. In P. pastoris, the receptors for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) include the PTS1 receptor, Pex5, and the PTS2 receptor and co-receptor, Pex7 and Pex20, respectively. These shuttling receptors are predominantly cytosolic and only partially peroxisomal. It remains unresolved as to whether, when and how the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal receptors, as well as the peroxisomal matrix proteins, are degraded under pexophagy conditions. These cytosolic pools exist both in normal and mutant cells impaired in peroxisome biogenesis. We report here that Pex5 and Pex7, but not Pex20, are degraded by an Atg30-independent, selective autophagy pathway. To enter this selective autophagy pathway, Pex7 required its major PTS2 cargo, Pot1. Similarly, the degradation of Pex5 was inhibited in cells missing abundant PTS1 cargoes, such as alcohol oxidases and Fox2 (hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase). Furthermore, in cells deficient in PTS receptors, the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal matrix proteins, such as Pot1 and Fox2, were also removed by Atg30-independent, selective autophagy, under pexophagy conditions. In summary, the cytosolic pools of PTS receptors and their cargoes are degraded via a pexophagy-independent, selective autophagy pathway under pexophagy conditions. These autophagy pathways likely protect cells from futile enzymatic reactions that could potentially cause the accumulation of toxic cytosolic products.

Moreover, TlGA had high resistance to most metal ions and chemical reagents tested. Various starch substrates could be hydrolyzed by TlGA, including soluble starch (255.6+/-15.3) U/mg, amylopectin (342.3+/-24.7) U/mg, glycogen (185.4+/-12.5) U/mg, dextrin (423.3+/-29.3) U/mg and pullulan (65.7+/-8.1) U/mg.

Two laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes were identified in the genome of M. importuna SCYDJ1-A1 as putative laccase-encoding genes. The two genes, belonging to Auxiliary Activity family 1 subfamily 3, were named as MiLacA and MiLacB. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences showed that MiLacA is closest to a LMCO of M. importuna 22J1, while MiLacB had low similarity with known Morchella LMCOs. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that MiLacA was expressed at much higher levels than MiLacB throughout the entire course of artificial cultivation. MiLacA was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris as a recombinant protein. Biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme showed that MiLacA simultaneously possessed laccase and polyphenol-oxidase activities. MiLacA could be strongly inhibited by Fe(2+), which is unusual. The optimum pH was four and optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. The enzyme retained over 74% of the laccase activity after 16-h incubation at 60 degrees C, which means that its thermostability is at the forefront among the currently known laccases. Our findings may help to elucidate how the laccase of M. importuna is involved in decaying lignin in plant litter, and could also provide a candidate thermostable laccase for potential industrial application.</p></details></div>

Herein, two distinct A2M genes (designated as PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2, respectively) were isolated from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 encoded proteins with 1541 or 1516 amino acids, respectively, containing the typically functional domains of A2M. Unlike highly expressed in hemocytes of most arthropods, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 were predominantly detected in gill, eyestalk and digestive tracks. During the embryonic stages, PtA2Ms were found to be expressed most highly in fertilized eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. After challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcripts of PtA2Ms showed similar time-dependent response expression pattern, while PtA2M-1 was more sensitive to Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris infection than PtA2M-2. Knockdown of PtA2M-1 or PtA2M-2 could significantly enhance the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and serine protease related genes (PtcSP1-3 and PtSPH), however, PtLSZ and the phagocytosis-related genes (PtMyosin and PtRab5) were effectively inhibited. These results were further supported by the PO and lysozyme activities in hemolymph of the PtA2M-1- or PtA2M-2-silenced crabs. In addition, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 could regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (PtALF1-3, PtCrustin1 and PtCrustin3) through the Toll and NF-kappaB pathways.

This study focused on identifying the removal of two widely used pesticides, isoproturon (IPU) and acetochlor (ACT), by a genetically developed paddy (or rice) plant overexpressing an uncharacterized glycosyltransferase (IRGT1). IRGT1 conferred plant resistance to isoproturon-acetochlor, which was manifested by attenuated cellular injury and alleviated toxicity of rice under isoproturon-acetochlor stress. A short-term study showed that IRGT1-transformed lines removed 33.3-48.3% of isoproturon and 39.8-53.5% of acetochlor from the growth medium, with only 59.5-72.1 and 58.9-70.4% of the isoproturon and acetochlor remaining in the plants compared with the levels in untransformed rice. This phenotype was confirmed by IRGT1-expression in yeast ( Pichia pastoris) which grew better and contained less isoproturon-acetochlor than the control cells. A long-term study showed that isoproturon-acetochlor concentrations at all developmental stages were significantly lower in the transformed rice, which contain only 59.3-69.2% (isoproturon) and 51.7-57.4% (acetochlor) of the levels in wild type. In contrast, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that more isoproturon-acetochlor metabolites were detected in the transformed rice. Sixteen metabolites of isoproturon and 19 metabolites of acetochlor were characterized in rice for Phase I reactions, and 9 isoproturon and 13 acetochlor conjugates were characterized for Phase II reactions in rice; of these, 7 isoproturon and 6 acetochlor metabolites and conjugates were reported in plants for the first time.</p></details></div>

Exploration of alternatives production systems like as extracellular expression in microorganisms generally recognized as safe (such as Pichia pastoris Glycoswitch((R))) could be advantageous, in particular, if this system is able to produce homogeneous glycosylation. Here, we evaluated extracellular expression into Glycoswitch((R)) using two different strains constructions containing the asnB gene coding for Erwinia chrysanthemi L-ASNase (with and without His-tag), in order to find the best system for producing the extracellular and biologically active protein. When the His-tag was absent, both cell expression and protein secretion processes were considerably improved. Three-dimensional modeling of the protein suggests that additional structures (His-tag) could adversely affect native conformation and folding from L-ASNase and therefore the expression and cell secretion of this enzyme.</p></details></div>

The phospholipase D-mediated green synthesis of phosphatidylserine has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In this study, the phospholipase D was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. The highest activity of phospholipase D was observed in C. glutamicum, which was 0.25 U/mL higher than these in B. subtilis (0.14 U/mL) and P. pastoris (0.22 U/mL). System engineering of three potential factors, including (1) signal peptides, (2) ribosome binding site, and (3) promoters, was attempted to improve the expression level of phospholipase D in C. glutamicum. The maximum phospholipase D activity reached 1.9 U/mL, which was 7.6-fold higher than that of the initial level. The enzyme displayed favorable transphosphatidylation activity and it could efficiently catalyze the substrates L-serine and soybean lecithin for synthesis of phosphatidylserine after optimizing the conversion reactions in detail. Under the optimum conditions (trichloromethane/enzyme solution 4:2, 8 mg/mL soybean lecithin, 40 mg/mL L-serine, and 15 mM CaCl2, with shaking under 40 degrees C for 10 h), the reaction process showed 48.6% of conversion rate and 1.94 g/L of accumulated phosphatidylserine concentration. The results highlight the use of heterologous expression, system engineering, and process optimization strategies to adapt a promising phospholipase D for efficient phosphatidylserine production in synthetic application.</p></details></div>

The results showed that EG27II has a double-psi six-stranded beta-barrel and that the structure of EG27II more closely resembles those of subfamily C enzymes than those of subfamily A enzymes. The structure of EG27II complexed with cellobiose was also determined under cryoconditions and at room temperature at three pH values, pH 4.0, 5.5 and 8.0, and no structural changes were found to be associated with the change in pH. The structural comparison and catalytic activity measurements showed that Asp137 and Asn112 function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively, and that Asp27 is also an important residue for catalysis.

Thus, they can act on water-insoluble carboxylic esters releasing long-chain fatty acids but also on sterol esters, although with different activity and affinity. The differences in the catalytic properties among the proteins of this family are explained by small changes in the hydrophobicity of some regions. One of such versatile enzymes is the sterol esterase/lipase from Ophiostoma piceae (OPE) that acts very efficiently on the two types of substrates. Structurally, OPE is characterized by the presence of a lid formed by a alpha-helix and two 310-helices rich in hydrophobic amino acids. In this study, the ope gene was modified by directed mutagenesis in order to change specific amino acids in the lid region to modify its structure with the aim of increasing its hydrophobicity. Several recombinant forms of OPE were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. In silico molecular dynamics simulations have been used to decipher the mechanistic principles behind the improvements in substrate catalysis. The analyses suggested that the enhanced activity toward hydrophobic substrates such as triglycerides could be due to a better stabilization of the substrate in the lid region as a result of an increased hydrophobicity and an improved topology. These results indicate that in silico simulations can be useful for the optimization of the activity of lipases from the C. rugose-like family for different biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

It has been challenging to develop a high performance alpha-galactosidase excelled on catalytic efficiency, thermostability, pH stability and protease-resistance that could efficiently hydrolyze RFOs. In this study, the first GH family 27 alpha-galactosidase gene from Irpex lacteus was cloned. The gene had an open reading frame of 1314bp interrupted by 12 introns. The recombinant alpha-galactosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris (rILgalA) had an apparent molecular mass of 64kDa and was highly N-glycosylated. rILgalA was maximally active at pH4.8 and 70 degrees C. It was stable over a broad pH range of 3-11, retained 90% of its activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 10h and exhibited strong resistance to digestive proteases. Unlike many other alpha-galactosidases, rILgalA was hyperactive on RFOs. Its specific activities toward melibiose, raffinose and stachyose were 644, 755 and 833Umg(-1), respectively. The corresponding Kcat/Km values were 120, 130 and 180mM(-1)s(-1), which were the highest among reported alpha-galactosidases. rILgalA almost completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose in soymilk at 60 degrees C in 30min.

In mammals, p40 can be secreted as a monomer or homodimer and acts independently to mediate cellular responses. Recently, three p40 paralogues were isolated and identified from grass carp and other fish species, but whether they exist independently as well as their functional consequences and significance remain unclear. In the present study, using grass carp as the model, we for the first time demonstrated the existence of natural fish p40a, p40b and p40c (gcp40a, gcp40b and gcp40c) mainly as a monomer in culture supernatant of head kidney leukocytes (HKLs). Particularly, their excessive secretion induced by various immune stimuli suggests possible involvement of free p40s in fish immune responses. To define their functions, recombinant grass carp p40a/b/c (rgcp40a, rgcp40b and rgcp40c) were prepared by Pichia pastoris expression system, and they possessed the activities to enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) in grass carp HKLs. These pro-inflammatory properties of p40 isoforms prompted us to investigate their roles during the inflammatory process. In line with this, in vivo study revealed the pathogenic effect of rgcp40a on intestinal inflammation, whereas gcp40a polyclonal antibodies remarkably ameliorated Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal histopathological changes. Taken together, our results uncover the biological significance of free p40s in teleost, and provide new clue for targeting fish intestinal inflammation.</p></details></div>

In this study, a novel mannose-binding lectin was cloned from the swimmimg crab Portunus trituberculatus (designated as PtMBL). The complete cDNA of PtMBL gene was 1208 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 732 bp that encoded 244 amino acid proteins. PtMBL shared lower amino acid similarity with other MBLs, yet it contained the conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with QPD motif and was clearly member of the collectin family. PtMBL transcripts were mainly detected in eyestalk and gill with sexually dimorphic expression. The temporal expression of PtMBL in hemocytes showed different activation times after challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The recombinant PtMBL protein revealed antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It could also bind and agglutinate (Ca(2+)-dependent) both bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, the agglutinating activity could be inhibited by both d-galactose and d-mannose, suggesting the broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition spectrum of PtMBL. These results together indicate that PtMBL could serve as not only a PRR in immune recognition but also a potential antibacterial protein in the innate immune response of crab.</p></details></div>

Fusion protein was optimized in terms of best expression condition and fibrinolytic activity and compared with the rSAK. Expression level of the designed construct reached up to 175 mg/L of the culture medium after 72-hr stimulation with 2.5% methanol and remained steady for 3-4 days. The highest expression was obtained at the range of 2-3% methanol. The SAK-2RGD-TT (relative activity >82%) was more active at 25-37 degrees C than rSAK (relative activity of 93%). Further, it showed relative activity >80% at pH ranges of 7-9. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 27 and 24 kDa at ratio of 5 to 3, respectively. The specific fibrinolytic activity of the SAK-2RGD-TTI was measured as 8,269 U/mg, and 19,616 U/mg for the nonpurified and purified proteins, respectively. Deglycosylation by using tunicamycin in culture medium resulted in higher fibrinolytic activity of SAK-2RGD-TTI (2.2 fold). Consequently, compared to the rSAK, at the same equimolar proportion, addition of RGD and TTI fragments could increase fibrinolytic activity. Also, P. pastoris can be considered as an efficient host for overexpression of the soluble SAK-2RGD-TTI with high activity without requiring a complicated purification procedure.</p></details></div>

Moreover, we propose a quality control protocol based on (1) a metabolite containing selenium to assess the instrument performance and on (2) in vivo synthesized isotopically enriched Pichia pastoris to validate the accuracy of carbon isotopologue distributions (CIDs), in this case considering each isotopologue of a targeted metabolite panel. Finally, validation involved a thorough assessment of procedural blanks and matrix interferences. We compared the analytical figures of merit regarding CID determination for over 40 metabolites between the three methods. Excellent precisions of less than 1% and trueness bias as small as 0.01-1% were found for the majority of compounds, whereas the CID determination of a small fraction was affected by contaminants. For most compounds, changes of labeling pattern as low as 1% could be measured. Graphical abstract.</p></details></div>

In this study, the effects of increasing hydrophobin gene copy number and overexpressing endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone proteins Kar2p, Pdi1p, and Ero1p were explored as a means to enhance recombinant yields of the class II hydrophobin HFBI in the eukaryotic expression host Pichia pastoris. One-, 2-, and 3-copy-HFBI strains were attained using an in vitro multimer ligation approach, with strains displaying copy number stability following subsequent transformations as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Increasing HFBI copy number alone had no effect on increasing HFBI secretion, but increasing copy number in concert with chaperone overexpression synergistically increased HFBI secretion. Overexpression of PDI1 or ERO1 caused insignificant changes in HFBI secretion in 1- and 2-copy strains, but a statistically significant HFBI secretion increase in 3-copy strain. KAR2 overexpression consistently resulted in enhanced HFBI secretion in all copy number strains, with 3-copy-HFBI secreting 22+/-1.6 fold more than the 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. The highest increase was seen in 3-copy-HFBI/Ero1p overexpressing strain with 30+/-4.0 fold increase in HFBI secretion over 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. This corresponded to an expression level of approximately 330 mg/L HFBI in the 5 ml small-scale format used in this study.</p></details></div>

In this study, volumetric mass transfer (kLa) and volumetric gassed power input (Pg/V) were evaluated within values attainable in large-scale production as scale-up criteria for recombinant dextranase production by Mut(S) P. pastoris strain. Cultures were oxygen limited when the volumetric gassed power supply was limited to 2 kW m(-3). Specific growth rate, and then dextranase production, increased as kLa and Pg/V did. Meanwhile, specific production and methanol consumption rates were constant, due to the limited methanol condition also achieved at 2 L bioprocesses. The specific dextranase production rate was two times higher than the values previously reported for a Mut(+) strain. After a scale-up process, at constant kLa, the specific growth rate was kept at 30 L bioprocess, whereas dextranase production decreased, due to the effect of methanol accumulation. Results obtained at 30 L bioprocesses suggest that even under oxygen-limited conditions, methanol saturated conditions are not adequate to express dextranase with the promoter alcohol oxidase. Bioprocesses developed within feasible and scalable operational conditions are of high interest for the commercial production of recombinant proteins from Pichia pastoris.</p></details></div>

MSTN inhibition by myostatin propeptide (MSPP) increased skeletal muscle mass, myofiber growth and muscle force. Thus, this study was designed to produce wild-type porcine MSPP (WT-MSPP) and its mutated form (D75A-MSPP) in yeast Pichia pastoris and to investigate its potential enhancement of myoblast growth and differentiation. In an in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP (10mug/mL) in either a regular culture medium or in a differentiation medium for 72h. In an animal trial, post-weaning C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were administered WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP for 6weeks. The results showed that C2C12 myoblasts treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP could dramatically promote cell proliferation. Both myoD and myogenin were significantly increased (p<.05) after WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP treatment. D75A-MSPP was particularly more effective than WT-MSPP in promoting myotube formation (p<.05). The post-weaning mice treated with D75A-MSPP significantly increased both body and muscle weights compared with the mock and WT-MSPP groups (p<.05). Furthermore, the mice treatment with D75A-MSPP could prevent increased glucose injection from inducing glucose elevation. Our data indicated that a mutant-type MSPP (D75A-MSPP) was superior to WT-MSPP in effectively enhancing myofiber growth due to the highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage by the bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid (BMP-1/TLD) and thus has potential applications for clinical muscle wasting diseases or for increasing muscle mass in meat-producing animals.</p></details></div>

The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-beta-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs and similarly to expansins, FgCPPs are trapped by cellulose and not by chitin, thus suggesting that these proteins interact with cellulose. A double knock-out mutant deleted of both FgCPPs encoding genes produces much more cellulase activity than the corresponding wild type strain when grown on CMC, likely compensating the absence of FgCPPs. This result prompted us to investigate a possible synergistic effect of these proteins with fungal cellulases. The incubation of FgCPPs in the presence of a fungal cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) determines an increased enzymatic activity on CMC, filter paper and wheat cell walls. The observation that FgCPPs act with a non-hydrolytic mechanism indicates that these proteins favor fungal cellulase activity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections.</p></details></div>

In this study, we bridged Mycobacterium neoaurum with Pichia pastoris to establish a step-wise biotransformation strategy for efficient biosynthesis of boldenone (BD) from phytosterol (PS). Firstly, the producing strains were rationally designed with overexpression of 3-ketosteroid-Delta1-dehydrogenase (KsdD) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17betaHSD) in M. neoaurum and P. pastoris, respectively. Then, to shorten the total biotransformation process and provide reducing power, semi-batch fermentation strategy and glucose supplementation strategy were introduced at side-chain degradation stage and carbonyl reduction stage, respectively. Under the optimal transformation conditions, the productivity of BD was increased from 10% to 76% and the total biotransformation process was shortened by 41.7%, which is the shortest among the ever reported. Our results demonstrated an excellent biological strategy for production of many other valuable microbial products from bioresources.</p></details></div>

However, pIFN-gamma is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-gamma in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-gamma protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-gamma protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-gamma gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-gamma gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-gamma gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-gamma protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0-24 h at 28 degrees C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24-72 h at 25 degrees C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression level of pIFN-gamma in Pichia pastoris was improved significantly by gene optimization with 3' end mutation and a fermentation process that maintained good biological activity, which is beneficial to the application of pIFN-gamma in animal husbandry.</p></details></div>

Methanol induction however poses several drawbacks. One approach to improve processes is to use MutS strains with reduced methanol catabolic ability. Various reports claim that MutS allows higher recombinant protein production levels than Mut+ but scarcely elaborate on reasons for differences. In this study, enhanced green fluorescent protein was used as a PAOX1 -driven reporter for the investigation of expression differences between Mut+ and MutS strains. Mut+ exhibited higher responses to methanol, with faster growth (0.07 vs. 0.01 hr(-1) ) and higher consumption of methanol (2.25 vs. 1.81 mmol/gDCW .hr) and oxygen (2.2 vs. 0.66 mmol/gDCW .hr) than MutS. Mut+ yielded more biomass than MutS (2.3 vs. 1.3 gDCW /L), and carbon dioxide analysis of bioreactor off-gas suggested that considerable amounts of methanol were consumed by Mut+ via the dissimilatory pathway. In contrast, it was demonstrated that the MutS population switched to an induced state more rapidly than Mut+. In addition, MutS exhibited 3.4-fold higher fluorescence levels per cell (77,509 vs. 23,783 SFU) indicative of higher recombinant protein production. The findings were verified by similar results obtained during the expression of a lipase. Based on the differences in response to methanol versus recombinant protein production, it was proposed that higher energy availability occurs in MutS for recombinant protein synthesis, contrary to Mut+ that uses the energy to maintain high levels of methanol catabolic pathways and biomass production.</p></details></div>

To promote the research and application of acid protease, an acid protease gene (pepA) from Aspergillus oryzae was obtained from fermented soy based on metagenome sequencing, and then cloned and transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 for heterologous expression. The characteristic of recombinant PepA was also investigated. The activity of acid protease in the culture supernatant of P. pastoris was 50.62 U/mL. The molecular mass of PepA was about 50 kDa, and almost no other proteins in the supernatant were observed, as shown by SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature of PepA were determined as pH 4.5 and 50 . Mn(2)(+) and Cu(2)(+) enhanced the activity of PepA, whereas Fe(3)(+), Fe(2)(+) and Ca(2) had inhibitory effects on its activity.

Here, we show that an evolutionary transition from covalent conjugation to non-covalent interaction has occurred in the ubiquitin-like autophagy-related 12 (ATG12) conjugation system. ATG12 is covalently conjugated to its sole substrate, ATG5, by a ubiquitylation-like mechanism. However, the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium and Toxoplasma and some yeast species such as Komagataella phaffii (previously Pichia pastoris) lack the E2-like enzyme ATG10 and the most carboxy (C)-terminal glycine of ATG12, both of which are required for covalent linkage. Instead, ATG12 in these organisms forms a non-covalent complex with ATG5. This non-covalent ATG12-ATG5 complex retains the ability to facilitate ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation. These results suggest that ubiquitin-like covalent conjugation can evolve to a simpler non-covalent interaction, most probably when the system has a limited number of targets.</p></details></div>

To obtain enzymes with enhanced catalytic efficiency (pH5.5) and excellent activity in acidic pH range, we performed structure-based rational design of a thermostable phytase (PhyAn). For this, six mutants based on different rational design strategies were constructed and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Particularly, the extracellular enzymatic activity was assessed to ensure that the produced enzymes met requirements of further analyses. Several positive mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency or pH-profile shifts were carefully examined. Biochemical and kinetic investigations of purified mutants revealed that E79K, E80K, E79K+E80K and D68K had higher catalytic efficiency than the parent enzyme by approximately 49%, 67%, 86% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, the optimum pH of mutant Y65H was shifted from 5.0 to 3.0, and the peak of D68K shifted to pH5.5. Analysis of the structural-functional relationships revealed that changes in amino acid charges, structural flexibility and space hindrance could significantly influence certain enzyme characteristics.

In this research, FOS produced by BfrA were characterized by HPAE-PAD analysis as a mixture of 1-kestotriose, 6(G)-kestotriose (neokestose), and to a major extent 6-kestotriose. In order to increase the FOS yield, three BfrA mutants (W14Y, W14Y-N16S and W14Y-W256Y), designed from sequence divergence between hydrolases and transferases, were constructed and constitutively expressed in the non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant glycoproteins were purified and characterized. The three mutants synthesized 6-kestotriose as the major component of a FOS mixture that includes minor amounts of tetra- and pentasaccharides. In all cases, sucrose hydrolysis was the predominant reaction. All mutants reached a similar overall FOS yield, with the average value 37.6% (w/w) being 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (12.6%, w/w). None of the mutations altered the enzyme thermophilicity and thermostability.

Due solely to their presence in the Wsc-family proteins working as a plasma membrane sensor for surface stress and in a fungal beta-1,3-exoglucanse, WSC domains have been presumed to possess carbohydrate-binding property without any experimental evidence. Aiming at elucidation of function(s) of WSC domains, we characterized a WSC domain-containing alcohol oxidase from the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (PoAlcOX). Recombinant PoAlcOX produced with Pichia pastoris showed alcohol oxidase activity toward a wide range of substrates including two aliphatic alcohols, a branched-chain alcohol, a diol, and a polyol. Deletion of the WSC domain virtually unaffected oxidation of these substrates by PoAlcOX, indicating that the domain makes no contribution to the catalytic activity. In analogy to some carbohydrate-binding modules, we inferred that the WSC domain plays a role in protein anchoring, and evaluated binding capability of PoAlcOX to a set of polysaccharide components of fungal and plant cell walls. This revealed that PoAlcOX binds to xylans and fungal chitin/beta-1,3-glucan in the WSC domain-dependent manner, demonstrating for the first time the carbohydrate-binding property of the domain. Additionally, we provide evidence that PoAlcOX immobilized on birch wood xylan retains the catalytic activity. Overall, the data we collected suggest that the role of the WSC domain of PoAlcOX is not recognition of substrates but attaching the enzyme to plant and/or fungal cell wall.</p></details></div>

Therefore, we investigated the conditions required for high-yield heterologous production of this enzyme using Pichia pastoris. When we employed P. pastoris to express His-ChuaHNL, the yield was very low (22.6 +/- 3.8 U/L culture). Hence, we investigated the effects of ChuaHNL codon optimization and the co-production of two protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) [from P. pastoris (PpPDI) and C. hualienensis (ChuaPDI1, ChuaPDI2)] on His-ChuaHNL production. The productivity of His-ChuaHNL was increased approximately 140 times per unit culture to 3170 +/- 144.7 U/L by the co-expression of codon-optimized ChuaHNL and PpPDI. Moreover, we revealed that the N-glycosylation on ChuaHNL had a large effect on the stability, enzyme secretion, and catalytic properties of ChuaHNL in P. pastoris. This study demonstrates an economical and efficient approach for the production of HNL, and the data show that glycosylation has a large effect on the enzyme properties and the P. pastoris expression system.</p></details></div>

In this study, an ordered biotransformation method was proposed employing Arthrobacter simplex and recombinant Pichia pastoris with 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce BD from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (AD) efficiently. To lower the oxidation towards BD in A. simplex, the transformation was conducted sequentially by C1,2 dehydrogenation in A. simplex and 17beta-carbonyl reduction in recombinant P. pastoris GS115. Moreover, the reaction system was inactivated before recombinant P. pastoris GS115 was added to further inhibit the oxidation of BD by A. simplex, and the productivity of BD was improved 10.6% compared with the control. Furthermore, by optimizing the conditions of transformation from AD to BD, 4.2 g/L BD was generated with 83% productivity from 5.0 g/L AD, which was the highest productivity reported by biological method. This study offers a promising method to produce BD by ordered biotransformation system, which can also be used to manufacture other steroidal compounds that are difficult to acquire directly.</p></details></div>

The purified 39.2kDa monomeric enzyme was optimally active at pH 6.5 and 50 degrees C and showed activity over a wide range of temperatures (30-70 degrees C) and pH (4.0-9.0), with a half-life of 1386min at 50 degrees C. The enzyme preferred NADPH as cofactor and showed broad substrate specificity. The enzyme was inhibited by Cu(2+), Fe(2+) and Zn(2+), while ferulic acid was found to be the most potent lignocellulosic inhibitor. Recombinant S. cerevisiae with the XRTL gene showed 34% higher xylitol production than the control strain. XRTL can therefore be used in a cell-free xylitol production process or as part of a pathway for utilization of xylose from lignocellulosic waste.</p></details></div>

This fungus also has another alpha-glucosidase-like protein, AgdB. To learn its function, wild-type AgdB was expressed in Pichia pastoris. However, the enzyme displayed two electrophoretic forms due to heterogeneity of N-glycosylation at Asn354. The deglycosylation mutant N354D shared the same properties with wild-type AgdB. N354D demonstrated hydrolytic specificity toward alpha-(1-->3)- and alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic linkages, indicating that AgdB is an alpha-1,3-/alpha-1,4-glucosidase. N354D-catalyzed transglucosylation from maltose was analyzed in short- and long-term reactions, enabling us to learn the transglucosylation specificity and product accumulation, respectively. A short-term reaction (<15 min) synthesized 3(II)- O-alpha-glucosyl-maltose and maltotriose, indicating alpha-1,3-/alpha-1,4-transferring specificity. A long-term reaction (<24 h) accumulated kojibiose and nigerose using formed glucose as an acceptor substrate. AgdA and AgdB are distinct alpha-glucosidases. At a high concentration of glucose added exogenously, AgdB largely generated the rare sugars kojibiose and nigerose (exhibiting beneficial physiological functions) with 19% and 24% yields from maltose, respectively.</p></details></div>

Currently, several new systems are commercially available; some of them are private and need licensing. The potential for secretory expression of heterologous proteins in yeast proposed this system as a candidate for the production of complex eukaryotic proteins.

Furthermore, the gene fusion yielded a positive effect with respect to the wild-type recombinant enzyme in terms of both immobilization and stability. The multi-well plate with the immobilized chimera was used to develop an optical biosensor to monitor two phenolic compounds: L-DOPA ((S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid) and caffeic acid (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid); the estimation of which is a matter of interest in the pharmaceutics and food field.

Glucuronoyl esterases are considered to play a unique role as accessory enzymes in lignocellulosic material biodegradation by cleaving the covalent ester linkage between 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) and lignin in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). Two glucuronoyl esterases from T. terrestris named TtGE1 and TtGE2 were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Both esterases displayed features of thermophilic enzymes, with the optimal temperature at 45 degrees C and 55 degrees C. TtGE1 and TtGE2 exhibited activity towards methyl (4-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranosid) uronate (Me-GlcA-pNP) but no catalytic activity to benzyl-D-glucuronate (BnzGlcA), indicating the difference in substrate specificity from previously studied fungal GEs. A substantial increase in the release of monomeric sugars and glucuronic acid from autohydrolysis of corn bran was observed by the supplementing TtGEs into commercial xylanase; the results clearly demonstrated that the TtGEs played a significant role in this degradation process. This research on TtGEs enriches our knowledge of this novel class of fungal GEs. These newly characterized TtGEs could be used as promising accessory enzymes to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of commercial enzymes in saccharification of lignocellulosic materials due to their thermophilic characteristics.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp. ) is one of the strongest promoters for heterologous gene expression. Although increasing the gene dosage is a common strategy to improve recombinant protein productivities, P. pastoris strains harboring more than two copies of a Rhizopus oryzae lipase gene (ROL) have previously shown a decrease in cell growth, lipase production, and substrate consumption, as well as a significant transcriptional downregulation of methanol metabolism. This pointed to a potential titration effect of key transcriptional factors methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1) and methanol-induced transcription factor (Mit1) regulating methanol metabolism caused by the insertion of multiple expression vectors. To prove this hypothesis, a set of strains carrying one and four copies of ROL (1C and 4C, respectively) were engineered to coexpress one or two copies of MXR1*, coding for an Mxr1 variant insensitive to repression by 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, or one copy of MIT1. Small-scale cultures revealed that growth, Rol productivity, and methanol consumption were improved in the 4C-MXR1* and 4C-MIT1, strains growing on methanol as a sole carbon source, whereas only a slight increase in productivity was observed for re-engineered 1C strains. We further verified the improved performance of these strains in glycerol-/methanol-limited chemostat cultures.</p></details></div>

Tachyplesin I (TP-I) is an antimicrobial peptide, which exhibits potent and broad-spectrum activities against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and tumor cells. However, limited amounts of TP-I produced in horseshoe crab restrict its large-scale use. In order to solve this problem, a eukaryotic expression system of Pichia pastoris with high TP-I expression was constructed by gene engineering. To achieve high expression of TP-I, 74 amino acid-long peptide (4TP-1) was designed containing 4 copies of TP-I, and specific cleavage sites for pancreatic elastase (-Ala downward arrow or -Gly downward arrow) and carboxypeptidase A (cleaves C terminal amino acid); these cleavage sites for enzymes were located between the four copies of TP-I. The gene sequence for the designed peptide was synthesized taking into consideration codon preferences for P. pastoris, and cloned into the highly efficient expression vector pGAPZalpha B. Host Pichia pastoris strain GS115cells were transfected by the constructed expression vector pGAPZalpha B-4tp-I by electroporation. Tricine-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was carried out to detect the expression of target peptides in the fermentation medium. This analysis showed a protein band of 3.3kDa, identical to that of chemically synthesized TP-I, verifying that successful synthesis and secretion of TP-I by genetically engineered P. pastoris. The concentration of TP-I in the fermentation broth was 27.24-29.53mg/L. High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis documented that the TP-I monomer had the same molecular weight, 2262.85, as the designed 17-amino acid sequence. The recombinant TP-I peptide displayed different levels of bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.

Expressions of FBP1 and TAL2 were upregulated by non-fermentative carbon sources, especially methanol was the best inducer for them, and FBA2 was induced only by methanol. On the other hand, FBA1, TAL1 and TKL1 showed constitutive expression. Strain fbp1Delta showed severe growth defect on methanol and non-fermentable carbon sources, and growth rate of strain fba2Delta in methanol medium was slightly decreased.

However, due to lack of biochemical and enzymatic studies, PDAT has not carried forward in biocatalyst application. Here, the PDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified enzymes were studied using different acyl donors and acceptors by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography. In addition of the preferred acyl donor of PE and PC, the results identified that ScPDAT was capable of using broad acyl donors such as PA, PS, PG, MGDG, DGDG, and acyl-CoA, and ScPDAT was more likely to use unsaturated acyl donors comparing 18:0/18:1 to 18:0/18:0 phospholipids. With regard to acyl acceptors, ScPDAT preferred 1,2 to 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG), while 12:0/12:0 DAG was identified as the optimal acyl acceptor, followed by 18:1/18:1 and 18:1/16:0 DAG. Additionally, ScPDAT reveals esterification activity that can utilize methanol as acyl acceptor to generate fatty acid methyl esters.

Various optimization strategies of processes based on AOX1 promoter have been investigated, including methanol co-feeding with glycerol or sorbitol during the induction stage. Compared with carbon sources, comparatively little research has been devoted to the effects of nitrogen sources. Several reports have described the benefits of adding casamino acids (CA) to the recombinant protein production medium, however, without considering its effects at the gene expression level. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter protein, monitored using flow cytometry, CA was shown to downregulate AOX1 promoter induction. Despite higher growth rates, cultures containing CA exhibited slower transition to the induced state, whereas metabolite analysis revealed that methanol consumption was reduced in the presence of CA compared with its absence. The repressive effect of CA was further confirmed by analysing the synthesis of extracellular recombinant Candida antarctica lipase under control of the AOX1 promoter.

Previous studies have shown that PLRA3 in Pichia pastoris is a strong rhamnose-inducible promoter for driving the industrial production of recombinant proteins. However, another important profile of PLRA3, the basal transcription, was not investigated yet. In this study, the basal transcription of PLRA3 was assessed according to the profiles of two test strains grown in media lacking rhamnose: (1) the production of secretory beta-galactosidase in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-LacB, in which lacB expression was regulated by PLRA3, and (2) growth in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-MazF, in which the expression of mazF, which encodes an intracellular toxic protein, was controlled by PLRA3. Analyses revealed low beta-galactosidase production and non-obviously inhibited growth of the test strains, which suggests that there was a low basal transcription level of PLRA3 when rhamnose was absent. Thus, PLRA3 was an excellent candidate for genetic manipulation in P. pastoris due to its strict regulation, a strong and a low transcriptional activity with and without rhamnose, respectively. Subsequently, two systems were developed based on PLRA3 in P. pastoris: (1) an efficient markerless gene deletion system for single or multiple genes and (2) a high efficient piggyBac transposase-mediated mutation system for investigating the functions of unknown genes, as well as for the screening of expected mutants.</p></details></div>

GlcNAc has many important physiological functions in organism, which can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis clinically and be used as food antioxidant, infant food additive and diabetic sweetener. Thus, it is very important to develop genetic-engineering strains with high-yield NAGase to hydrolyze chitin into GlcNAc. Here, the NAGase gene of Bacillus subtilis 168 (BsnagZ) was synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris and expressed in P. pastoris. The expression level of BsNagZ in P. pastoris increased over the induced time and the highest activity reached 0.76 U/mL at the 7th day. The recombinant BsNagZ was purified for characterization. The optimal temperature and pH are 60 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. It can both keep over 80% activities after pre-incubation at 55 degrees C for one hour and at 4 degrees C for 12 h from pH 4.5 to 10.0. To further improve the expression level of BsNagZ, a recombinant strain with four copy BsnagZs was screened using a high concentration of zeocin. The highest BsNagZ activity reached 3.2 U/mL at the 12th day, which was fourfold higher than that of single-copy strain. Combined with commercial chitinase CtnSg, GlcNAc can be produced by recombinant BsNagZ when used colloidal chitin as the substrate. Our study highlights that the NAGase was first successfully expressed in P. pastoris and GlcNAc can be produced via NAGase hydrolyzing the colloidal chitin.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp.). Nonetheless, the reduced number of carbon atoms and the symmetry of the glycerol molecule has hampered the comprehensive determination of metabolic fluxes when used as the labelled C-source. Moreover, metabolic models typically used for (13)C-based flux balance analysis may be incomplete or misrepresent the actual metabolic network. To circumvent these limitations, we reduced the genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026-v3.0 into a core model and used it for the iterative fitting of metabolic fluxes to the measured mass isotope distribution of proteinogenic amino acids obtained after fractional (13)C labelling of cells with [1,3-(13)C]-glycerol. This workflow allows reliable estimates to be obtained for in vivo fluxes in P. pastoris cells growing on glycerol as sole carbon source, as well as revising previous assumptions concerning its metabolic operation, such as alternative metabolic branches, calculation of energetic parameters and proposed specific cofactor utilisation.</p></details></div>

In this study, a novel aspartic protease gene (Tlap) was identified in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Using casein as the substrate, purified recombinant TlAP showed optimal activities at pH 3.0 and 55 degrees C with a specific activity of 1795.4+/-62.8U/mg, and remained stable over a pH range of 3.0-6.0 and at temperatures of 45 degrees C and below. Moreover, the enzyme was highly resistant to most metal ions and chemical reagents except for Fe(3+) and beta-mercaptoethanol. When added to apple, orange, grape and kiwi fruit juice, it showed excellent proteolytic activity against haze-forming proteins, decreasing the turbidity by up to 49.9 nephelometry turbidity units (NTU). These favorable enzymatic properties make TlAP attractive for potential use in the juice industry.</p></details></div>

Recombinant riceXIP (rePriceXIP) was secreted into the supernatant and purified to homogeneity with the use of Ni-affinity resin. The molecular mass of rePriceXIP was approximately 44.0kDa. RePriceXIP significantly inhibited the activity of GH11 xylanases in a concentration-dependent manner. The optimal inhibitory activity of rePriceXIP on GH11 xylanases (TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526) occurred at 40 degrees C for 30min. The IC50 values of rePriceXIP inhibiting TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 (0.5 U) were 45, 40, and 40nM, respectively. The Ki of rePriceXIP on TfxA_CD214 xylanase was 12.2nM. Increasing the concentration of rePriceXIP did not change Vmax, but increased Km, thereby suggesting that the inhibition was competitive. Analysis of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the Kq values for TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 exceeded 2.0x10(10)Lmol(-1)*s(-1), implying that static quenching occurred. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that rePriceXIP bound to xylanase, thereby changing the secondary structure and reducing the catalytic activity of xylanase. Lower levels of hydrolytes are released from beechwood xylan by xylanases in the presence of rePriceXIP.</p></details></div>

Here, we report the cloning, heterologous expression, purification and characterization of a novel LMCO from the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila. The 1953 bp lmco gene sequence comprises of 3 exons interrupted by 2 introns and according to the LccED database the translated sequence belongs to superfamily 6 of multicopper oxidases. After removal of the introns, the gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris, under the control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous enzyme was purified with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa. TtLMCO1 displayed optimum activity at pH 4 and 50 degrees C and appeared thermostable up to 50 degrees C. A variety of phenolic compounds were oxidized by TtLMCO1, including standard laccase substrates such as ABTS and 2,6 dimethoxyphenol. The UV/Vis spectrum of purified TtLMCO1 indicates that it belongs to yellow laccase-like oxidases. The enzyme was used for the bioconversion of 2',3,4-trihydroxychalcone to 3',4'-dihydroxy-aurone, a bioactive aurone recently shown to possess inhibitory activity against several isoforms of the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Overall, the thermophilic yellow LMCO TtLMCO1 presents a number of superior properties with potential use in industrial biocatalysis.</p></details></div>

The membrane-bound enzyme alternative oxidase (AOX) is critical for M. perniciosa virulence and resistance to fungicides, which has also been observed in other phytopathogens. Notably AOX is an escape mechanism from strobilurins and other respiration inhibitors, making AOX a promising target for controlling WBD and other fungal diseases.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We present the first study aimed at developing novel fungal AOX inhibitors. N-Phenylbenzamide (NPD) derivatives were screened in the model yeast Pichia pastoris through oxygen consumption and growth measurements. The most promising AOX inhibitor (NPD 7j-41) was further characterized and displayed better activity than the classical AOX inhibitor SHAM in vitro against filamentous fugal phytopathogens, such as M. perniciosa, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Venturia pirina. We demonstrate that 7j-41 inhibits M. perniciosa spore germination and prevents WBD symptom appearance in infected plants. Finally, a structural model of P. pastoris AOX was created and used in ligand structure-activity relationships analyses.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> We present novel fungal AOX inhibitors with antifungal activity against relevant phytopathogens.

The roles of lncRNAs in Pichia pastoris remain unclear. In this work, we focused on the identification of lncRNAs in P. pastoris and exploration of their potential roles in stress response to PLA2 overexpression and methanol induction. By strand specific RNA sequencing, 208 novel long non-coding RNAs were identified and analyzed. Bioinformatic analysis showed potential trans-target genes and cis-regulated genes of 39 differential lncRNAs. Functional annotation and sequence motif analysis indicated that lncRNAs participate in pathways related to methanol degradation and production of the recombinant protein. The differential expression of lncRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR. Lastly, the potential functions of three lncRNAs were evaluated by knockdown of their expression and analysis of the expression levels of target genes. Our study identifies novel lncRNAs in P. pastoris induced during use as a bioreactor, facilitating future functional research.</p></details></div>
