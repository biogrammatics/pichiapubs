Drugs are useful against hookworm infections, but hookworms rapidly reinfect people, and the parasites can develop drug resistance. Therefore, having a hookworm vaccine would be of tremendous benefit. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> We investigated the vaccine efficacy in outbred Syrian hamsters of three A. ceylanicum hookworm antigen candidates from two classes of proteins previously identified as promising vaccine candidates. These include two intestinally-enriched, putatively secreted cathepsin B cysteine proteases (AceyCP1, AceyCPL) and one small Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (AceySKPI3). Recombinant proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris, and adsorbed to Alhydrogel. Recombinant AceyCPL (rAceyCPL)/Alhydrogel and rAceySKPI3/Alhydrogel induced high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in 8/8 vaccinates, but were not protective. rAceyCP1/Alhydrogel induced intermediate serum IgG titers in ~60% of vaccinates in two different trials. rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had highly significantly decreased hookworm burdens, fecal egg counts and clinical pathology compared to Alhydrogel controls and nonresponders. Protection was highly correlated with rAceyCP1 serum IgG titer. Antisera from rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders, but not nonresponders or rAceyCPL/Alhydrogel vaccinates, significantly reduced adult A. ceylanicum motility in vitro. Furthermore, rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had canonical Th2-specific recall responses (IL4, IL5, IL13) in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> These findings indicate that rAceyCP1 is a promising vaccine candidate and validates a genomic/transcriptomic approach to human hookworm vaccine discovery.</p></details></div>

In yeasts, pexophagy depends mostly on the pexophagy receptors, such as Atg30 for Pichia pastoris and Atg36 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the autophagy scaffold proteins, Atg11 and Atg17, and the core autophagy machinery. In P. pastoris, the receptors for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) include the PTS1 receptor, Pex5, and the PTS2 receptor and co-receptor, Pex7 and Pex20, respectively. These shuttling receptors are predominantly cytosolic and only partially peroxisomal. It remains unresolved as to whether, when and how the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal receptors, as well as the peroxisomal matrix proteins, are degraded under pexophagy conditions. These cytosolic pools exist both in normal and mutant cells impaired in peroxisome biogenesis. We report here that Pex5 and Pex7, but not Pex20, are degraded by an Atg30-independent, selective autophagy pathway. To enter this selective autophagy pathway, Pex7 required its major PTS2 cargo, Pot1. Similarly, the degradation of Pex5 was inhibited in cells missing abundant PTS1 cargoes, such as alcohol oxidases and Fox2 (hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase). Furthermore, in cells deficient in PTS receptors, the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal matrix proteins, such as Pot1 and Fox2, were also removed by Atg30-independent, selective autophagy, under pexophagy conditions. In summary, the cytosolic pools of PTS receptors and their cargoes are degraded via a pexophagy-independent, selective autophagy pathway under pexophagy conditions. These autophagy pathways likely protect cells from futile enzymatic reactions that could potentially cause the accumulation of toxic cytosolic products.

In this study, microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris strain GS115, and the enzyme activity was approximately 0.70U/ml. The recombinant MTG expressed in P. pastoris was used in the investigation of restructured pork and crosslinking of soy protein isolate (SPI) and chicken myofibrillar protein (MP). Results showed that the hardness, chewiness, and F1 of the restructured pork increased, and the adhesiveness decreased after MTG treatment, However, high temperature had greater effect on the texture of restructured pork after MTG treatment than that of the control. MTG can crosslink SPI component acidic subunits, subunits of beta-conglycinin and MP component myosin heavy chain, and actin. MTG, as a food additive, can be successfully heterologously expressed, and the recombinant MTG has potential application in restructured meat products.</p></details></div>

Two laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes were identified in the genome of M. importuna SCYDJ1-A1 as putative laccase-encoding genes. The two genes, belonging to Auxiliary Activity family 1 subfamily 3, were named as MiLacA and MiLacB. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences showed that MiLacA is closest to a LMCO of M. importuna 22J1, while MiLacB had low similarity with known Morchella LMCOs. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that MiLacA was expressed at much higher levels than MiLacB throughout the entire course of artificial cultivation. MiLacA was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris as a recombinant protein. Biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme showed that MiLacA simultaneously possessed laccase and polyphenol-oxidase activities. MiLacA could be strongly inhibited by Fe(2+), which is unusual. The optimum pH was four and optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. The enzyme retained over 74% of the laccase activity after 16-h incubation at 60 degrees C, which means that its thermostability is at the forefront among the currently known laccases. Our findings may help to elucidate how the laccase of M. importuna is involved in decaying lignin in plant litter, and could also provide a candidate thermostable laccase for potential industrial application.</p></details></div>

Herein, two distinct A2M genes (designated as PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2, respectively) were isolated from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 encoded proteins with 1541 or 1516 amino acids, respectively, containing the typically functional domains of A2M. Unlike highly expressed in hemocytes of most arthropods, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 were predominantly detected in gill, eyestalk and digestive tracks. During the embryonic stages, PtA2Ms were found to be expressed most highly in fertilized eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. After challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcripts of PtA2Ms showed similar time-dependent response expression pattern, while PtA2M-1 was more sensitive to Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris infection than PtA2M-2. Knockdown of PtA2M-1 or PtA2M-2 could significantly enhance the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and serine protease related genes (PtcSP1-3 and PtSPH), however, PtLSZ and the phagocytosis-related genes (PtMyosin and PtRab5) were effectively inhibited. These results were further supported by the PO and lysozyme activities in hemolymph of the PtA2M-1- or PtA2M-2-silenced crabs. In addition, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 could regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (PtALF1-3, PtCrustin1 and PtCrustin3) through the Toll and NF-kappaB pathways. Our findings together suggest that PtA2Ms might function in crab host defense via regulating the proPO system, phagocytosis and the expression of AMP genes.</p></details></div>

This study focused on identifying the removal of two widely-used pesticides isoproturon (IPU) and acetochlor (ACT) by a genetically developed paddy (or rice) plant overexpressing an uncharacterized glycosyltransferase (IRGT1). IRGT1 conferred plant resistance to isoproturon/acetochlor, which was manifested by attenuated cellular injure and alleviated toxicity of rice growth under isoproturon/acetochlor stress. A short-term study showed that IRGT1-transformed lines removed 33.3-48.3% and 39.8-53.5% from the growth medium and remained only 59.5-72.1% and 58.9-70.4% isoproturon and acetochlor in plants compared to untransformed rice, respectively. This phenotype was well confirmed by IRGT1-expression in yeast (Pichia pastoris) which grew better and contained less isoproturon/acetochlor than control cells. A long-term study showed that isoproturon/acetochlor concentrations at all developmental stages were significantly lower in the transformed rice containing only 59.3-69.2% (isoproturon) and 51.7-57.4% (acetochlor) of those in wild-type. In contrast, UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that more isoproturon/acetochlor metabolites were detected in the transformed rice. Sixteen metabolites of isoproturon (19 for acetochlor) for Phase I reaction and 9 isoproturon conjugates (13 for acetochlor) for Phase II reaction in rice were characterized, of which 7 isoproturon and 6 isoproturon metabolites or conjugates were reported in plants for the first time.</p></details></div>

Exploration of alternatives production systems like as extracellular expression in microorganisms generally recognized as safe (such as Pichia pastoris Glycoswitch((R))) could be advantageous, in particular, if this system is able to produce homogeneous glycosylation. Here, we evaluated extracellular expression into Glycoswitch((R)) using two different strains constructions containing the asnB gene coding for Erwinia chrysanthemi L-ASNase (with and without His-tag), in order to find the best system for producing the extracellular and biologically active protein. When the His-tag was absent, both cell expression and protein secretion processes were considerably improved. Three-dimensional modeling of the protein suggests that additional structures (His-tag) could adversely affect native conformation and folding from L-ASNase and therefore the expression and cell secretion of this enzyme.</p></details></div>

The phospholipase D-mediated green synthesis of phosphatidylserine has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In this study, the phospholipase D was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. The highest activity of phospholipase D was observed in C. glutamicum, which was 0.25 U/mL higher than these in B. subtilis (0.14 U/mL) and P. pastoris (0.22 U/mL). System engineering of three potential factors, including (1) signal peptides, (2) ribosome binding site, and (3) promoters, was attempted to improve the expression level of phospholipase D in C. glutamicum. The maximum phospholipase D activity reached 1.9 U/mL, which was 7.6-fold higher than that of the initial level. The enzyme displayed favorable transphosphatidylation activity and it could efficiently catalyze the substrates L-serine and soybean lecithin for synthesis of phosphatidylserine after optimizing the conversion reactions in detail. Under the optimum conditions (trichloromethane/enzyme solution 4:2, 8 mg/mL soybean lecithin, 40 mg/mL L-serine, and 15 mM CaCl2, with shaking under 40 degrees C for 10 h), the reaction process showed 48.6% of conversion rate and 1.94 g/L of accumulated phosphatidylserine concentration. The results highlight the use of heterologous expression, system engineering, and process optimization strategies to adapt a promising phospholipase D for efficient phosphatidylserine production in synthetic application.</p></details></div>

The results showed that EG27II has a double-psi six-stranded beta-barrel and that the structure of EG27II more closely resembles those of subfamily C enzymes than those of subfamily A enzymes. The structure of EG27II complexed with cellobiose was also determined under cryoconditions and at room temperature at three pH values, pH 4.0, 5.5 and 8.0, and no structural changes were found to be associated with the change in pH. The structural comparison and catalytic activity measurements showed that Asp137 and Asn112 function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively, and that Asp27 is also an important residue for catalysis. These high-resolution structures of EG27II provide a large amount of information for structure-based enzyme modification and cell-surface engineering, which will advance biofuel production using animal-derived cellulases.</p></details></div>

Thus, they can act on water-insoluble carboxylic esters releasing long-chain fatty acids but also on sterol esters, although with different activity and affinity. The differences in the catalytic properties among the proteins of this family are explained by small changes in the hydrophobicity of some regions. One of such versatile enzymes is the sterol esterase/lipase from Ophiostoma piceae (OPE) that acts very efficiently on the two types of substrates. Structurally, OPE is characterized by the presence of a lid formed by a alpha-helix and two 310-helices rich in hydrophobic amino acids. In this study, the ope gene was modified by directed mutagenesis in order to change specific amino acids in the lid region to modify its structure with the aim of increasing its hydrophobicity. Several recombinant forms of OPE were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. In silico molecular dynamics simulations have been used to decipher the mechanistic principles behind the improvements in substrate catalysis. The analyses suggested that the enhanced activity toward hydrophobic substrates such as triglycerides could be due to a better stabilization of the substrate in the lid region as a result of an increased hydrophobicity and an improved topology. These results indicate that in silico simulations can be useful for the optimization of the activity of lipases from the C. rugose-like family for different biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

In this study, the first GH family 27 alpha-galactosidase gene from Irpex lacteus was cloned. The gene had an open reading frame of 1314bp interrupted by 12 introns. The recombinant alpha-galactosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris (rILgalA) had an apparent molecular mass of 64kDa and was highly N-glycosylated. rILgalA was maximally active at pH4.8 and 70 degrees C. It was stable over a broad pH range of 3-11, retained 90% of its activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 10h and exhibited strong resistance to digestive proteases. Unlike many other alpha-galactosidases, rILgalA was hyperactive on RFOs. Its specific activities toward melibiose, raffinose and stachyose were 644, 755 and 833Umg(-1), respectively. The corresponding Kcat/Km values were 120, 130 and 180mM(-1)s(-1), which were the highest among reported alpha-galactosidases. rILgalA almost completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose in soymilk at 60 degrees C in 30min.

In mammals, p40 can be secreted as a monomer or homodimer and acts independently to mediate cellular responses. Recently, three p40 paralogues were isolated and identified from grass carp and other fish species, but whether they exist independently as well as their functional consequences and significance remain unclear. In the present study, using grass carp as the model, we for the first time demonstrated the existence of natural fish p40a, p40b and p40c (gcp40a, gcp40b and gcp40c) mainly as a monomer in culture supernatant of head kidney leukocytes (HKLs). Particularly, their excessive secretion induced by various immune stimuli suggests possible involvement of free p40s in fish immune responses. To define their functions, recombinant grass carp p40a/b/c (rgcp40a, rgcp40b and rgcp40c) were prepared by Pichia pastoris expression system, and they possessed the activities to enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) in grass carp HKLs. These pro-inflammatory properties of p40 isoforms prompted us to investigate their roles during the inflammatory process. In line with this, in vivo study revealed the pathogenic effect of rgcp40a on intestinal inflammation, whereas gcp40a polyclonal antibodies remarkably ameliorated Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal histopathological changes. Taken together, our results uncover the biological significance of free p40s in teleost, and provide new clue for targeting fish intestinal inflammation.</p></details></div>

The recombinant PtMBL protein revealed antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It could also bind and agglutinate (Ca(2+)-dependent) both bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, the agglutinating activity could be inhibited by both d-galactose and d-mannose, suggesting the broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition spectrum of PtMBL. These results together indicate that PtMBL could serve as not only a PRR in immune recognition but also a potential antibacterial protein in the innate immune response of crab.</p></details></div>

To increase the potency of SAK and to minimize vessel reocclusion, a new construct bearing SAK motif fused to tsetse thrombin inhibitor (TTI) via a 20-amino acid linker with 2 RGD (2 x Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid inhibiting platelet aggregation via attachment to integrin receptors of platelet) was codon optimized and expressed comparatively in Pichia pastoris GS115 as a Mut(+) strain and KM71H as a Mut(s) strain. Fusion protein was optimized in terms of best expression condition and fibrinolytic activity and compared with the rSAK. Expression level of the designed construct reached up to 175 mg/L of the culture medium after 72-hr stimulation with 2.5% methanol and remained steady for 3-4 days. The highest expression was obtained at the range of 2-3% methanol. The SAK-2RGD-TT (relative activity > 82%) was more active at 25-37 degrees C than rSAK (relative activity of 93%). Further, it showed relative activity > 80% at pH ranges of 7-9. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 27 and 24 kDa at ratio of 5 to 3, respectively. The specific fibrinolytic activity of the SAK-2RGD-TTI was measured as 8269 U/mg, and 19616 U/mg for the non-purified and purified proteins, respectively. Deglycosylation by using tunicamycin in culture medium resulted in higher fibrinolytic activity of SAK-2RGD-TTI (2.2 fold). Consequently, compared to the rSAK, at the same equimolar proportion, addition of RGD and TTI fragments could increase fibrinolytic activity. Also, P. pastoris can be considered as an efficient host for overexpression of the soluble SAK-2RGD-TTI with high activity without requiring a complicated purification procedure.

Here, we present a validation scheme including a comparison of different LC methods that allow for customization of analytical strategies for tracer studies with regard to the targeted metabolites. As the measurement of significant changes in labeling patterns depends on the spectral accuracy, we investigate this aspect comprehensively for high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry combined with reversed-phase chromatography, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, or anion-exchange chromatography. Moreover, we propose a quality control protocol based on (1) a metabolite containing selenium to assess the instrument performance and on (2) in vivo synthesized isotopically enriched Pichia pastoris to validate the accuracy of carbon isotopologue distributions (CIDs), in this case considering each isotopologue of a targeted metabolite panel. Finally, validation involved a thorough assessment of procedural blanks and matrix interferences. We compared the analytical figures of merit regarding CID determination for over 40 metabolites between the three methods. Excellent precisions of less than 1% and trueness bias as small as 0.01-1% were found for the majority of compounds, whereas the CID determination of a small fraction was affected by contaminants. For most compounds, changes of labeling pattern as low as 1% could be measured. Graphical abstract.</p></details></div>

Currently, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using an enzyme produced in CHO cells represents the main treatment option for MPS IVA patients. As an alternative, we reported the production of an active GALNS enzyme produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris (prGALNS), which showed internalization by cultured cells through a potential receptor-mediated process and similar post-translational processing as human enzyme. In this study, we further studied the therapeutic potential of prGALNS through the characterization of the N-glycosylation structure, in-vitro cell uptake and KS reduction, and in-vivo biodistribution and generation of anti-prGALNS antibodies. Taken together, these results represent an important step in the develop of a P. pastoris-based platform for production of a therapeutic GALNS for MPS IVA ERT.</p></details></div>

Far UV CD structure analysis revealed major beta-sheet and minor alpha helical segments present in the Lcc1. A significant change in the spectrum of Lcc1, indicative of unfolding of secondary structures, was observed with increasing concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) during Trp fluorescence, absorption and CD measurements. A similar trend was also noticed for enzyme activity with respect to GdnHCl concentrations. To establish the role of copper ion in the catalytic activity of laccase, a complete removal of copper was carried out and addition of copper was found to restore the structure and activity during the refolding process. The apo form was also reconstituted by addition of zinc ion which restored nearly 84% of enzyme activity, indicating non-essential role of copper in maintaining conformation and activity. Structural studies and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry data supported these observations.</p></details></div>
