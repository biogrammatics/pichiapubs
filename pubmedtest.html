Komagataella spp.) is a popular cell factory for recombinant protein production. Yeasts in general provide a good starting point for cell factory engineering. They are intrinsically robust and easy to manipulate and cultivate. However, their secretory pathway is not evolutionarily adapted to high loads of secretory protein. In particular, more complex proteins, like the antibody fragment (Fab) used in this study, overwhelm the folding and secretion capacity. This triggers cellular stress responses, which may cause excessive intracellular degradation. Previous results have shown that, in fact, about 60 % of the newly synthesized Fab is intracellularly degraded. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is one possible intracellular degradation pathway for proteins aimed for secretion. We therefore targeted ERAD for cell factory engineering and investigated the impact on recombinant protein secretion in P. pastoris. Three components of the ERAD-L complex, which is involved in the degradation of luminal proteins, and a protein involved in proteasomal degradation, were successfully disrupted in Fab-secreting P. pastoris. Contrary to expectation, the effect on secretion was marginal. In the course of more detailed investigation of the impact of ERAD, we took a closer look at the intracellular variants of the recombinant protein. This enabled us to further zero in on the issue of intracellular Fab degradation and exclude an overshooting ER quality control. We propose that a major fraction of the Fab is actually degraded before entering the secretory pathway.</p></details></div>

Despite its highly selective mechanism of action, the presence of this flavooxidase in different biotechnological settings has hitherto been hampered by the lack of appropriate heterologous expression systems. We recently described the functional expression of the AAO from Pleurotus eryngii in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by fusing a chimeric signal peptide (prealphaproK) and applying structure-guided evolution. Here, we have obtained an AAO secretion variant that is readily expressed in S. cerevisiae and overproduced in Pichia pastoris. First, the functional expression of AAO in S. cerevisiae was enhanced through the in vivo shuffling of a panel of secretion variants, followed by the focused evolution of the prealphaproK peptide. The outcome of this evolutionary campaign -an expression variant that accumulated 4 mutations in the chimeric signal peptide, plus two mutations in the mature protein- showed 350-fold improved secretion (4.5 mg/L) and was stable. This secretion mutant was cloned into P. pastoris and fermented in a fed-batch bioreactor to enhance production to 25 mg/L. While both recombinant AAO from S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris were subjected to the same N-terminal processing and had a similar pH activity profile, they differed in their kinetic parameters and thermostability. The strong glycosylation observed in the evolved AAO from S. cerevisiae underpinned this effect, since when the mutant was produced in the glycosylation-deficient S. cerevisiae strain triangle upkre2, its kinetic parameters and thermostability were comparable to its poorly glycosylated P. pastoris recombinant counterpart.

Methods: A total of 180 weanling pigs (initial body weights were 8.47 +/- 1.40 kg) were assigned randomly to 5 dietary treatments. Each treatment had 6 replicates with 6 pigs per replicate. The experimental diets were wheat based with supplementation of 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 U xylanase/kg. The experiment lasted 28 days (early phase, d 0-14; late phase, d 15-28). Results: In the early phase, compared to the control, average daily gain (ADG) was higher for pigs fed diets supplemented with xylanase and there was a quadratic response in ADG (P<0.05).

Increasing the amount of xylanase improved the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, calcium, and phosphorus during both periods (p<0.05). Xylanase supplementation (2000 U/kg) decreased the proportion of Lachnospiraceae (by 50%) in Firmicutes, but increased Prevotellaceae (by 175%) in Bacteroidetes and almost diminished Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia-Shigella) in Proteobacteria. Conclusion: Xylanase supplementation increased growth performance and nutrient digestibility up to 2000 U/kg. Supplementation of xylanase (2000 U/kg) decreased the richness of gut bacteria but diminished the growth of harmful pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella, in the colon.</p></details></div>

Previously it was expressed in Escherichia coli; however, the E. coli-derived recombinant VpDef did not show effective antimicrobial activity against Staphyloccocus aureus or the Gram-negative bacteria tested. As such, the goal of this study was to design, express, and purify a recombinant VpDef (rVpDef) in Pichia pastoris and to determine its antibacterial potency and stability. A 6.9KDa rVpDef was successfully expressed as a secreted peptide in P. pastoris, and the amount of rVpDef accumulation was shown to reach as high as approximate 60mug per 1ml of culture medium only after an initial optimization was performed. The purified rVpDef demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was active against six typical common bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. A minimal inhibition concentration of as low as 50mug/ml was observed for rVpDef against the growth of E. coli O157 (ATCC 35150). Moreover, rVpDef was tolerant to temperature shock and proteinase digestion and maintained a high stability over a relatively broad pH range. In addition, rVpDef had a low hemolytic activity against rabbit erythrocytes. Taken together, this study demonstrated that rVpDef could be produced in a large-scale manner in P. pastoris and has a good antibacterial activity and suitable stability. This is the first report on heterologous expression of a biologically active VpDef in P. pastoris, supporting is use for both research and application purposes.</p></details></div>

However, the broad application of this protein is seriously limited by its short supply. In this work, the codon sequence of HSA was cloned under the control of the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (AOX1) and expressed as a secretory protein in Pichia pastoris. A recombinant strain displaying the highest HSA yield was selected by screening for resistance to the highest concentration of antibiotic G418. After optimizing the induction conditions and additional supplements, the highest yield of HSA reached 1.6 g/L in a shake flask. Performing high density fermentation further improved the highest yield to 8.86 g/L in a fermenter after 96 h of methanol induction. This result is more promising than the previous reports of industrial applications, which reported the highest yield as 92.29 mg/L/h, considering that the space-time yield of rHSA was doubled. In addition, the desired protein was purified by filtration and Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, which yielded a 58% recovery of a product that had over a 96% purity. This study reveals that Pichia pastoris is an excellent system for recombinant human serum albumin expression due to its outstanding expression capacity. In addition, the high efficiency level of rHSA production lays a solid foundation for its use in industrial production.</p></details></div>

Recently, a protein harboring DM9 repeats was identified as mannose-specific lectin (CgCGL1, renamed as CgDM9CP-1) from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. In the present study, another DM9 containing protein was identified from oyster C. gigas (designated as CgDM9CP-2). The open reading frame of CgDM9CP-2 gene was of 432 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 143 amino acids with two tandem DM9 repeats. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgDM9CP-2 shared 60.8% identity with that of CgDM9CP-1. In the unrooted phylogenetic tree, CgDM9CP-2 was closely clustered with CgDM9CP-1, and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate DM9CPs. The mRNA transcripts of CgDM9CP-2 were expressed in all the tested tissues, including mantle, gonad, gills, adductor muscle, hemocytes, and hepatopancreas, with the highest expression level in gills. CgDM9CP-2 protein was mainly distributed on the cytomembrane of oyster hemocytes. After mannose stimulation, the mRNA expression of CgDM9CP-2 in gills was up-regulated to the peak level (5.90-fold of that in SSW group, p<0.05) at 24h, and kept at a significantly higher level compared with that in control group at 6-48h. It significantly increased at 6h (2.33-fold, p<0.05), and 12h (3.08-fold, p<0.05) post Vibrio splendidus stimulation, and then gradually decreased from 48 to 72h (p<0.05) with significant difference comparing with that in control group. The recombinant CgDM9CP-2 protein (rCgDM9CP-2) displayed higher binding affinity to D-(+)-mannose while lower binding affinity to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. rCgDM9CP-2 also exhibited binding activity towards fungi (Pichia pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus), and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas hydrophila and V. splendidus). It could agglutinate fungi P. pastoris and Y. lipolytica, and inhibit the growth of P. pastoris, S. aureus, V. anguillarum, and V. splendidus. These results collectively indicated that CgDM9CP-2 not only served as a pattern recognition receptor with a broad range of recognition spectrum, but also involved in inhibiting the growth of invading microbe in the innate immune response of oyster, which would provide further evidence for the function of DM9 domain in the innate immune system.</p></details></div>

We report on the cloning and expression of a recombinant F. gigantica 14-3-3 epsilon protein (rFg14-3-3e), and testing its effects on specific functions of goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> rFg14-3-3e protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris. Western blot and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were used to examine the reactivity of rFg14-3-3e protein to anti-F. gigantica and anti-rFg14-3-3e antibodies, respectively. Various assays were used to investigate the stimulatory effects of the purified rFg14-3-3e protein on specific functions of goat PBMCs, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, migration, nitric oxide (NO) production, phagocytosis, and apoptotic capabilities. Potential protein interactors of rFg14-3-3e were identified by querying the databases Intact, String, BioPlex and BioGrid. A Total Energy analysis of each of the identified interaction was performed. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using Funcassociate 3.0.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Sequence analysis revealed that rFg14-3-3e protein had 100% identity to 14-3-3 protein from Fasciola hepatica. Western blot analysis showed that rFg14-3-3e protein is recognized by sera from goats experimentally infected with F. gigantica and immunofluorescence staining using rat anti-rFg14-3-3e antibodies demonstrated the specific binding of rFg14-3-3e protein to the surface of goat PBMCs. rFg14-3-3e protein stimulated goat PBMCs to produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), corresponding with low levels of IL-4 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Also, this recombinant protein promoted the release of NO and cell apoptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of goat PBMCs and suppressed monocyte phagocytosis. Homology modelling revealed 65% identity between rFg14-3-3e and human 14-3-3 protein YWHAE. GO enrichment analysis of the interacting proteins identified terms related to apoptosis, protein binding, locomotion, hippo signalling and leukocyte and lymphocyte differentiation, supporting the experimental findings.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our data suggest that rFg14-3-3e protein can influence various cellular and immunological functions of goat PBMCs in vitro and may be involved in mediating F. gigantica pathogenesis. Because of its involvement in F. gigantica recognition by innate immune cells, rFg14-3-3e protein may have applications for development of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.</p></details></div>

However, the application of lunasin is limited by its high cost. In this study, we developed a successful protocol for expression of a dimer formation protein containing 4 tandem repeated lunasin analogs (lunasin-4) in Pichia pastoris. The expression level at the optimal condition (initial pH 7.0, 1.0% final methanol concentration and induction for 72 h at 26 degrees C) was 0.24 mg/mL cell-free broth. Lunasin analog, obtained from purified lunasin-4 protein through enterokinase digestion and ultrafiltration, significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, intracellular signaling array analysis demonstrated down-regulated levels of phosphorylated Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k) and an up-regulated level of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) after lunasin analog treatment. These results suggest that lunasin analog exerted anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells partly via inhibiting the activation of Akt/mTOR/p70s6k signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study provides a potential strategy for recombinant production of bioactive lunasin in industry.</p></details></div>

Maximum activity was observed at pH 2.5 and 40 degrees C, and the enzyme was stable in the pH range of 2.5-6.0. rP6281 significantly inhibited spore germination and growth of plant and animal pathogenic fungi such as Botrytis cinerea, Mucor circinelloides, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizoctonia solani, and Candida albicans. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that rP6281 efficiently damages the cell wall of Botrytis cinerea.

By strand specific RNA sequencing, 208 novel long non-coding RNAs were identified and analyzed. Bioinformatic analysis showed potential trans-target genes and cis-regulated genes of 39 differential lncRNAs. Functional annotation and sequence motif analysis indicated that lncRNAs participate in pathways related to methanol degradation and production of the recombinant protein.

We identified a hypothetical protein (annotated as AO090012000917) encoded in the Aspergillus oryzae genome that exhibits sequence similarity with Aspergillus niger rutinosidase. The recombinant enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and purified as a glyco-protein with apparent molecular mass of 65-75 kDa by SDS-PAGE. After N-deglycosylation, we observed a 42- and 40-kDa band, representing proteins before and after N-terminal signal peptide processing, respectively. Optimal enzymatic activity was observed at pH 4.0 and temperature of 45 degrees C. This enzyme is also significantly thermo-stable, with 90% activity retained after 1 h at 45 degrees C and 70% activity retained after 4 h, even at 50 degrees C. Biochemical characterization revealed that the enzyme has higher substrate specificity for 3-O-linked flavonoid beta-rutinosides like rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, than for 7-O-linked flavonoid beta-rutinoside like hesperidin. However, no activity was found with naringin, diosmin, monoglycosylated chromogenic substrates, and polymeric laminarin substrate. Kinetic analyses showed that K m value toward rutin was higher than those toward hesperidin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside.

The black liquor (BL) generated exhibits a high chemical oxygen demand (COD), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and chlorophenol content, along with an augmented colour and increased pH. BL is often discharged into water bodies, where it has a negative impact on the environment. Towards that end, laccases are of great interest for bioremediation, since they can degrade aromatic and non-aromatic compounds while reducing O2 to water instead of H2O2. As such, we evaluated Pleurotus ostreatus and Pichia pastoris (which produces rPOXA 1B laccase) in the treatment of synthetic BL (SBL) in an "in vitro" modified Kraft process followed by CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis. Treating SBL with P. ostreatus viable biomass (VB) followed by CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis resulted in 80.3% COD removal and 70.6% decolourisation. Toxic compounds such as 2-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol, and 2-methoxyphenol were eliminated. Post-treated SBL exhibited low phytotoxicity, as evidenced by a Lactuca sativa L seed germination index (GI) > 50%. Likewise, SBL treatment with P. pastoris followed by VB/CuO/TiO2/visible light photocatalysis resulted in 63.7% COD removal and 46% decolourisation. Moreover, this treatment resulted in the elimination of most unwanted compounds, with the exception of 4-chlorophenol. The Lactuca sativa L seed GI of the post-treated SBL was 40%, indicating moderate phytotoxicity.</p></details></div>

Based on traditional culture-dependent methods, these functional enzymes are hardly obtained. According to our previous metatranscriptomic analysis, which identifies plenty of thermostable carbohydrate-active enzymes in NF liquor starter, the aim of this study is to provide a direct and efficient way to mine these thermostable enzymes.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In present study, an alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) gene, which showed the highest expression level of enzymes in starch degradation at high temperature stage (62 degrees C), was directly obtained by functional metatranscriptomics from Chinese Nong-flavor liquor starter and expressed in Pichia pastoris. NFAmy13A had a typical signal peptide and shared the highest sequence identity of 64% with alpha-amylase from Aspergillus niger. The recombinant enzyme of NFAmy13A showed an optimal pH at 5.0-5.5 and optimal temperature at 60 degrees C. NFAmy13A was activated and stabilized by Ca(2+), and its half-lives at 60 and 70 degrees C were improved significantly from 1.5 and 0.4 h to 16 and 0.7 h, respectively, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2. Meanwhile, Hg(2+), Co(2+) and SDS largely inhibited its activity. NFAmy13A showed the maximum activity on amylopectin, followed by various starches, amylose, glycogen, and pullulan, and its specificity activity on amylopectin was 200.4 U/mg. Moreover, this alpha-amylase efficiently hydrolyzed starches (from corn, wheat, and potato) at high concentrations up to 15 mg/ml.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study provides a direct way to mine active enzymes from man-made environment of NF liquor starter, by which a fungal thermostable alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) is successfully obtained. The good characteristics of NFAmy13A in degrading starch at high temperature are consistent with its pivotal role in solid-state fermentation of NF liquor brewing. This work would stimulate mining more enzymes from NF liquor starter and studying their potentially synergistic roles in NF liquor brewing, thus paving the way toward the optimization of liquor production and improvement of liquor quality in future.</p></details></div>

However, there is currently no commercial vaccine available to prevent CVA10 infection. Here we report the development of a recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) based candidate vaccine for CVA10. Co-expression of the capsid protein precursor P1 and the protease 3CD of CVA10 in Pichia pastoris resulted in cleavage of P1 into three capsid subunit proteins VP0, VP1, and VP3. These three subunit proteins co-assembled into CVA10 VLPs, which were visualized as spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 30nm under electron microscope. Immunization studies showed that CVA10 VLP could efficiently induce antigen-specific serum antibodies in mice. The anti-VLP sera were able to potently neutralize homologous and heterologous CVA10 strains. Importantly, passively transferred anti-VLP sera fully protected recipient neonatal mice from lethal CVA10 infection. In addition, neonatal mice born to the VLP-immunized dams were also completely protected from CVA10 lethal challenge. Collectively, these data show that CVA10 VLP represents a promising CVA10 vaccine candidate.</p></details></div>

To penetrate the cell wall and thereby to facilitate infection, microbial pathogens are equipped with a wide array of cell wall-degrading enzymes to depolymerize the polysaccharides in the cell wall. However, many of these enzymes and their role in the pathogenesis of microbial pathogens are not characterized, especially those from Oomycetes. In this study, we analyzed the function of four putative endo-beta-1,4-xylanase-encoding genes (ppxyn1-ppxyn4) from Phytophthora parasitica, an oomycete plant pathogen known to cause severe disease in a wide variety of plant species. All four genes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10). Recombinant proteins of ppxyn1, ppxyn2, and ppxyn4 obtained from the yeast Pichia pastoris showed degrading activities toward birch wood xylan, but they behaved differently in terms of the conditions for optimal activity, thermostability, and durability. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed upregulated expression of all four genes, especially ppxyn1 and ppxyn2, during plant infection. In contrast, ppxyn3 was highly expressed in cysts and its close homolog, ppxyn4, in germinating cysts. To uncover the role of ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the pathogenesis of P. parasitica, we generated silencing transformants for these two genes by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing. Silencing ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 reduced the virulence of P. parasitica toward tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and tomato plants. These results demonstrate the crucial role of xylanase-encoding ppxyn1 and ppxyn2 in the infection process of P. parasitica.</p></details></div>

They were discovered almost a century ago and they have been the subject of many biochemical, structural and pharmacological investigations due to their central role in neurotransmitter metabolism. Currently, the treatment of Parkinson's disease involves the use of selective MAO B inhibitors such as rasagiline and safinamide. MAO inhibition was shown to exert a general neuroprotective effect as a result of the reduction of oxidative stress produced by these enzymes, which seems to be relevant also in non-neuronal contexts. MAOs were successfully expressed as recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris, which allowed a thorough biochemical and structural characterization. These enzymes are characterized by a globular water-soluble main body that is anchored to the mitochondrial membrane through a C-terminal alpha-helix, similar to other bitopic membrane proteins. In both MAO A and MAO B the enzyme active site consists of a hydrophobic cavity lined by residues that are conserved in the two isozymes, except for few details that determine substrate and inhibitor specificity. In particular, human MAO B features a dual-cavity active site whose conformation depends on the size of the bound ligand. This article provides a comprehensive and historical review of MAOs and the state-of-the-art of these enzymes as membrane drug targets.</p></details></div>

One candidate organism for lactic acid production is Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for heterologous protein production. Nevertheless, this yeast has a poor fermentative capability that can be modulated by controlling oxygen levels. In a previous study, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was introduced into P. pastoris, enabling this yeast to produce lactic acid. The present study aimed to increase the flow of pyruvate towards the production of lactic acid in P. pastoris. To this end, a strain designated GLp was constructed by inserting the bovine lactic acid dehydrogenase gene (LDHb) concomitantly with the interruption of the gene encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). Aerobic fermentation, followed by micro-aerophilic culture two-phase fermentations, showed that the GLp strain achieved a lactic acid yield of 0.65 g/g. The distribution of fermentation products demonstrated that the acetate titer was reduced by 20% in the GLp strain with a concomitant increase in arabitol production: arabitol increased from 0.025 g/g to 0.174 g/g when compared to the GS115 strain. Taken together, the results show a significant potential for P. pastoris in producing lactic acid. Moreover, for the first time, physiological data regarding co-product formation have indicated the redox balance limitations of this yeast.</p></details></div>

Superior expression systems are required to obtain abundant M. tuberculosis proteins for the purpose of diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection or for the immunization. Here, HBHA was expressed by Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) GS115 strain , and the immunogenicity of HBHA was evaluated. Materials and Methods: The HBHA gene of M. tuberculosis was cloned into the pPIC9K plasmid, which was good for electroporation into P. pastoris GS115 strain. Unlabeled HBHA protein was purified using a Sepharose CL-6B column, and its expression was confirmed using anti-HBHA polyclonal antibody from mouse serum. We injected C57BL/6 mice with HBHA/ dimethyldioctadecylammonium/trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (HBHA/DDA/TDB) to investigate the immunogenicity of this potential vaccine. Results: The results demonstrated that HBHA/DDA/TDB has the ability to induce high levels of HBHA-specific IgG antibody and its subclasses, as well as interferon-gamma, compared with injection of phosphate-buffered saline, DDA/TDB alone and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) controls (P<0.05). Moreover, the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 of the HBHA/DDA/TDB group was higher than that of the BCG group (P<0.05).

Hyaluronidases from animal venoms cleave hyaluronan present in the extracellular matrix, acting as spreading factors of toxins into the tissues of the victim. However, the in-depth characterization of hyaluronidase from animal venoms has been neglected due to its instability and low concentration in the venom, which hamper its isolation. Thus, heterologous expression of hyaluronidase acts as a biotechnological tool in the obtainment of enough amounts of the enzyme for structural and functional studies. Therefore, this study produced a recombinant hyaluronidase from Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, designated as rTsHyal-1, in the Pichia pastoris system. Thus, a gene for TsHyal-1 (gb|KF623285.1) was synthesized and cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector (GenScript Corporation) for heterologous expression in P. pastoris. rTsHyal-1 was expressed in laboratorial scale in a buffered minimal medium containing methanol (BMM) for 96 h with daily addition of methanol. Expression of rTsHyal-1 resulted in a total protein yield of 0.266 mg/mL. rTsHyal-1 partially purified through cation exchange chromatography presented a specific activity of 1097 TRU/mg, against 838 TRU/mg for the final expressed material, representing a 1.31-fold purification. rTsHyal-1 has molecular mass of 49.5 kDa, and treatment with PNGase F and analysis by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) indicated a potential N-glycosylation of 4.5 kDa. Additionally, de novo sequencing of rTsHyal-1, performed in MALDI-TOF and Q Exactive Orbitrap MS, resulted in 46.8% of protein sequence coverage. rTsHyal-1 presents the highest substrate specificity to hyaluronan followed by chondroitin-6-sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate and showed an optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C. These results validate the biotechnological process for the heterologous expression of rTsHyal-1. This is the first recombinant hyaluronidase from scorpion venoms expressed in the P. pastoris system with preserved enzyme activity.</p></details></div>

After an appropriate cloning strategy, this genetically engineered inulinase was successfully overproduced in fed-batch fermentations, reaching up to 840 U/ml after a 72-h cultivation. The protein, purified to homogeneity by chromatographic techniques, was obtained at a 42% yield. The following biochemical characteristics were determined: the enzyme had an optimal pH of 3, was stable for at least 3hat 55 degrees C, and was inhibited in catalytic activity almost completely by Hg(+2). The respective Km and Vmax for the recombinant inulinase with inulin as substrate were 1.35mM and 2673mumol/min/mg. The recombinant enzyme is an exoinulinase but also possesses synthetic activity (i. e., fructosyl transferase).

Here, we used a new combined strategy to overexpress ROL in Pichia pastoris. An efficient method based on bio-brick was developed to construct a series of vectors harboring different copy numbers of ROL gene cassettes, which were then transformed into P. pastoris GS115 to generate a strain with specific copy numbers of ROL. An optimized gene-dosage recombinant strain of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# harboring five copies of ROL was screened, revealing production of the highest activity (2700 U/mL), which was 8-fold higher than that of the strain harboring one copy. The activity of GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11# was then enhanced to 3080 U/mL in a shaking flask under optimized culture conditions. Subsequently, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein-degradation-related genes Ubc1 or/and Hrd1 were co-expressed with ROL to further increase ROL expression. The activities of the recombinant strains, GS115/5ROL-Ubc1 22#, -Hrd1 15#, and -Hrd1-Ubc1 1#, were 4000 U/mL, 4200 U/mL, and 4750 U/mL, which was 29.9%, 36.4%, and 54.2% higher, respectively, than that observed in GS115/pAOalpha-5ROL 11#.

Optically pure 2,3-BD is a crucial precursor for the chiral synthesis and it can also be used as anti-freeze agent due to its low freezing point. 2,3-BD has been produced in both native and non-native hosts. Several pathogenic bacteria were reported to produce 2,3-BD in mixture of its optical isomers including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Engineered hosts based on episomal plasmid expression such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis are not ideal for industrial fermentation due to plasmid instability. Results: Pichia pastoris is generally regarded as safe and a well-established host for high-level heterologous protein production. To produce pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD enantiomer, we developed a P. pastoris strain by introducing a synthetic pathway. The alsS and alsD genes from B. subtilis were codon-optimized and synthesized. The BDH1 gene from S. cerevisiae was cloned. These three pathway genes were integrated into the genome of P. pastoris and expressed under the control of GAP promoter. Production of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was achieved using glucose as feedstock. The optical purity of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was more than 99%. The titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD reached 12 g/L with 40 g/L glucose as carbon source in shake flask fermentation. The fermentation conditions including pH, agitation speeds and aeration rates were optimized in batch cultivations. The highest titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD achieved in fed-batch fermentation using YPD media was 45 g/L. The titer of 2,3-BD was enhanced to 74.5 g/L through statistical medium optimization. Conclusions: The potential of engineering P. pastoris into a microbial cell factory for biofuel production was evaluated in this work using (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD as an example. Engineered P. pastoris could be a promising workhorse for the production of optically pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD.</p></details></div>

Spt23 is responsible for regulation of Delta-9 desaturase expression in Pichia pastoris. Disruption of SPT23 leads to a remarkable decrease in cellular unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, we found that deletion of SPT23 resulted in growth defect under high temperature culture conditions and heat treatment induced the expression of SPT23. By measuring expression changes of heat shock proteins, protein levels and cellular localization of Hsf1, it revealed that the sensitivity of spt23Delta to high temperature was independent of heat shock response. Addition of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol can restore the growth defects of spt23Delta under heat condition. In addition, loss of SPT23 led to increased plasma membrane permeability, decreased plasma membrane integrity, depolarization, ergosterol synthesis defect and cell wall component disorder, which suggested that the sensitivity to heat treatment in spt23Delta was due to plasma membrane damage. Taken together, our results give new insights into the relationship between Spt23 and high temperature environmental stress.</p></details></div>

To obtain endoglucanases with substantially improved activity and thermostability, structure-based rational design was carried out based on the Chaetomium thermophilum beta-1,4-endoglucanase CTendo45. In this study, five mutant enzymes were constructed by substitution of conserved and noncatalytic residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants were constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and ultimately tested for enzymatic characteristics. Two single mutants, Y30F and Y173F, increased the enzyme's specific activity 1.35- and 1.87-fold using carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) as a substrate, respectively. Furthermore, CTendo45 and mutants exhibited higher activity towards beta-D-glucan than that of CMC-Na, and activities of Y173F and Y30F were also increased obviously against beta-D-glucan. In addition, Y173F significantly improved the enzyme's heat resistance at 80 degrees C and 90 degrees C. More interestingly, the double mutant Y30F/Y173F obtained considerably higher stability at elevated temperatures but failed to inherit the increased catalytic efficiency of its single mutant counterparts. This work gives an initial insight into the biological function of conserved and noncatalytic residues of thermostable endoglucanases and proposes a feasible path for the improvement of enzyme redesign proposals.</p></details></div>

They occur in every kingdom of life and catalyze essential reactions, such as carbon source assimilation, synthesis of hormones and secondary metabolites, or degradation of xenobiotics. Due to their outstanding ability of specifically hydroxylating complex hydrocarbons, there is a great demand to use these enzymes for biocatalysis, including applications at an industrial scale. Thus, the recombinant production of these enzymes is intensively investigated. However, especially eukaryotic P450s are difficult to produce. Challenges are faced due to complex cofactor requirements and the availability of a redox-partner (cytochrome P450 reductase, CPR) can be a key element to get active P450s. Additionally, most eukaryotic P450s are membrane bound which complicates the recombinant production. This review describes current strategies for expression of P450s in the microbial cell factories Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Pichia pastoris.</p></details></div>

Neutron scattering, and in particular neutron diffraction can provide unique and detailed information on the structure of lipid membranes. However, deuterated samples are desirable to fully exploit this powerful method. Recently, the extraction of lipids from microorganisms grown in deuterated media was demonstrated to be both an attracting route to obtain complex lipid mixtures resembling the composition of natural membranes, and to producing deuterated molecules in a very convenient way. A full characterization of these deuterated extracts is hence pivotal for their use in building up model membrane systems. Here we report the structural characterization of lipid extracts obtained from Pichia pastoris by means of neutron diffraction measurements. In particular, we compare the structure of membranes extracted from yeast cells grown in a standard culture medium and in a corresponding deuterated culture medium. The results show that the different molecular composition of the deuterated and protiated lipid extracts induce different structural organization of the lipid membranes. In addition, we compare these membranes composed of extracted yeast lipids with stacked bilayers prepared from synthetic lipid mixtures.</p></details></div>

The mRmMan5A showed maximum activity at pH 4.5 and 65 degrees C, and exhibited high specific activities towards mannans. To produce manno-oligosaccharides, palm kernel cake (PKC) was pretreated by steam explosion at 200 degrees C for 7.5min, and then hydrolyzed by mRmMan5A. As a result, the total manno-oligosaccharide yield reached 34.8g/100g dry PKC, indicating that 80.6% of total mannan in PKC was hydrolyzed. Moreover, the kilo-scale production of manno-oligosaccharides was carried out to verify the feasibility of mass production. A total of 261.3g manno-oligosaccharides were produced from 1.0kg of dry PKC.

However, this traditional strategy suffers with the problems of difficulty in DO control, toxic by-metabolites accumulation and low targeted protein titer. Therefore, initiating methanol induction at lower cell concentration is considered as an alternative strategy to overcome those problems. However, the methanol/energy regulation mechanisms of initiating induction at lower concentration are not clear and seldom reported. In this article, with monellin production as a prototype, we analyzed the methanol/energy metabolism in protein expression process using the strategies of initiating induction at both higher/lower cells concentrations. We attempted to interpret the advantages of the "alternative" strategy, via online measurements of methanol consumption, CO(2) production and O(2) uptake rates. When adopting this "alternative" strategy and maintaining temperature at 30 degrees C, carbon flux ratio directing into monellin precursors synthesis reached the highest level of 65%.

The complete nucleotide sequence of EcCDA1 contained a 1611 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding EcCDA1 precursor of 536 amino acids. The domain architecture of the deduced EcCDA1 protein contained a signal peptide, a chitin-binding peritrophin-A domain (ChtBD2), a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain (LDLa) and a Polysacc_deac_1 domain. EcCDA1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the gills. The expression of EcCDA1 in the prawns challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila changed in a time-dependent manner. The expression of EcCDA1 in the prawns challenged with V. parahaemolyticus was up-regulated at 12h (p<0.05), and significantly up-regulated at 24h and 48h (p<0.01), and then returned to the control levels at 96h post-challenge (p>0.05).

In spite of different attempts to produce recombinant human KGF in many organisms, including bacteria, mammalian cells, plant cells and insect cells; production of recombinant form suffers from lower yields and recovery relative to other recombinant proteins of similar size and properties. Due to many advantages of Pichia pastoris expression systems for producing industrial enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins, in this study P. pastoris was chosen as a host for KGF expression. For preparing human KGF coding sequence, MCF-7 cell line was treated with 1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3 for inducing the expression of KGF. The coding sequence of 23N-terminal truncated KGF form was amplified using RT-PCR technique and then cloned into the yeast expression vector in frame with the yeast alpha-factor secretion signal. The recombinant plasmid was integrated into Pichia pastoris strain X-33 genome. Western blotting and Mass Spectrometry demonstrated that recombinant human KGF (rhKGF) was correctly expressed after methanol induction and secreted into the media. The recombinant protein was purified from the media by heparin affinity chromatography. MTT assay showed that the purified rhKGF had a proliferative effect on NIH3T3 and A549 cell lines. In addition, protective effect of recombinant KGF was assessed in A549 cell line after irradiation. The results showed that the recombinant protein was biologically active. Finally, the effect of recombinant KGF was investigated on proliferation of MCF-7 cell line and its response to radiation. The results showed that pre-treatment of KGF have a protective effect on MCF-7 cell line after irradiation.</p></details></div>

In nature, this conversion is associated with a defense mechanism of fungal pathogens against phytoalexins generated by host plants after infection. As of today, a gene sequence coding for kievitone hydratase activity has only been identified and characterized in Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli. Here, we report on the identification of a putative kievitone hydratase sequence in Nectria haematococca (NhKHS), the teleomorph state of F. solani, based on in silico sequence analyses. After heterologous expression of the enzyme in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, we have confirmed its kievitone hydration activity and have assessed its biochemical properties and substrate specificity. Purified recombinant NhKHS is obviously a homodimeric glycoprotein. Due to its good activity for the readily available chalcone derivative xanthohumol (XN), this compound was selected as a model substrate for biochemical studies. The optimal pH and temperature for hydratase activity were 6.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively, and apparent Vmax and Km values for hydration of XN were 7.16 mumol min-1 mg-1 and 0.98 +/- 0.13 mM, respectively. Due to its catalytic properties and apparent substrate promiscuity, NhKHS is a promising enzyme for the biocatalytic production of tertiary alcohols.</p></details></div>

The prevention of infection by MAP in ruminants is thought to deter the high impact of economic losses in the level of dairy industry and possible spreading of this pathogen in dairy products. The present study was done to investigate the construction and expression of the soluble form of a novel fusion protein, consisting of Heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) and high antigenic region of Fibronectin Attachment Protein-P (FAP-P), in order to introduce as a Th1 inducer subunit vaccine against MAP. HBHA is a mycobacterial adhesin and it has been demonstrated that a HBHA-specific IFN-gamma response, in latent M. tuberculosis infection, depends on the methylation of the antigen. Further, FAP-P induces Th1 polarization. Because methylation of HBHA was not performed in E. coli, Pichia pastoris was chosen as the host. The desired fusion protein had a similar 3D structure to that of HBHA with its native form and post-translational methylation in C-terminal. Hence, the uptake of the purified fusion protein will be done by M cells because of HBHA, and cell-mediated immunity will be induced because of both antigens. Eventually, successful construction and expression of the newly-designed chimeric protein under the mentioned conditions is reported in this article.</p></details></div>

However, the only available yeast-derived rhIL-11 presents an obstacle in low production yield, as well as an unamiable process, such as the use of reverse-phase chromatography employing plenty of toxic organic solvents. Our findings showed that the low yield was due to self-aggregation of rhIL-11. A novel process recovering bioactive rhIL-11 from the yeast secretory medium therefore has been developed and demonstrated, involving fermentation from Pichia pastoris, followed by a two-phase extraction to precipitate rhIL-11. After renaturing, the protein of interest was purified by a two-column step, comprising a cation-exchanger, and a hydrophobic interaction chromatography in tandem at high sample loads that was facile and cost-effective in future scale-up. Identity and quality assessments confirmed the expected amino acid sequence without N-terminal heterogeneity, as well as high quality in potency and purity.

An effective vaccine should be able to prevent both, the horizontal and vertical transmission of N. caninum. In this study, the immune vaccinal response of the recombinant protein rNcSRS2 of N. caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris and formulated with water-in-oil emulsion, xanthan gum, and alum hydroxide was assessed in an experimental murine model. Groups of 10 Balb/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated with two doses of prNcSRS2 twenty-one days apart. After the second immunization, four mice from each group were euthanized, and splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo with recombinant protein. The IgG dynamics were evaluated by indirect ELISA, and the splenocytes cytokines transcription by qPCR. All groups elicited specific antibodies against prNcSRS2, with the water-in-oil group showing significantly (p</=.05) elevated titers compared to the other groups. The prNcSRS2 protein alone did not induce a significant ex vivo splenic transcription level of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 cytokines, except for IL-17A, and the adjuvant associations with the prNcSRS2 protein induced different cytokine transcription profiles. The water-in-oil emulsion modulated the expression of TNF-alpha; the xanthan gum modulated IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12; and alum hydroxide modulated IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12. In conclusion, it was found that the association of the recombinant prNcSRS2 protein with different adjuvants induced different levels of specific antibody, and a distinct splenic cytokine profile in an adjuvant-dependent manner. The mechanisms of adjuvancity activity is complex, so adjuvant formulation may help in the design of efficient vaccine to control Neosporosis.</p></details></div>

In this work, the individual reactions of terreic acid biosynthesis were determined by stepwise pathway assembly in a heterologous host, Pichia pastoris, on the basis of previous knockout studies in a native host, Aspergillus terreus. Polyketide synthase AtX was found to catalyze the formation of partially reduced polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid, followed by 3-methylcatechol synthesis by salicylate 1-monooxygenase AtA-mediated decarboxylative hydroxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid. Our results show that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase AtE hydroxylates 3-methylcatechol, thus producing the next product, 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol. A smaller putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, AtG, assists with this step. Then, AtD causes epoxidation and hydroxyl oxidation of 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol and produces a compound terremutin, via which the previously unknown function of AtD was identified as cyclooxygenation. The final step involves an oxidation reaction of a hydroxyl group by a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase, AtC, which leads to the final product: terreic acid. Functions of AtD and AtG were determined for the first time. All the genes were reanalyzed and all intermediates and final products were isolated and identified. Our model fully defines the molecular steps and corrects previous results from the literature.</p></details></div>

As recombinant CCII (rCCII) might avoid potential pathogenic virus contamination during nCCII preparation or chromosomal integration and oncogene activation associated with DNA vaccines, here we evaluated the importance of propeptide and telopeptide domains on rCCII triple helix molecular assembly. We constructed pC- and pN-procollagen (without N- or Cpropeptides, respectively) as well as CTEs located in the triple helical domain lacking both propeptides and telopeptides, and expressed these in yeast Pichia pastoris host strain GS115 (his4, Mut(+)) simultaneously with recombinant chicken prolyl-4-hydroxylase alpha and beta subunits. Both pC- and pN-procollagen monomers accumulated inside P. pastoris cells, whereas CTE was assembled into homotrimers with stable conformation and secreted into the supernatants, suggesting that the large molecular weight pC-or pN-procollagens were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the smaller CTEs proceeded through the secretory pathway. Furthermore, resulting recombinant chicken type II collagen pCalpha1(II) can induced collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, which seems to be as effective as the current standard nCCII. Notably, protease digestion assays showed that rCCII could assemble in the absence of C- and N-propeptides or telopeptides. These findings provide new insights into the minimal structural requirements for rCCII expression and folding.</p></details></div>

Sl-PME and Sl-EPG were overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and enzymatically characterized. Sl-EPG presents optimal activity at pH4-5 and 50 degrees C, showing that it can be used for juice extraction and clarification. On the other hand, Sl-PME presents optimal activity at pH6-8 and 40 degrees C, and thus, suitable for both acidic and alkaline processing, such as coffee and tea fermentation. Sl-EPG shows Vmax=3.23mM/min, KM=2.4g/L and kcat=418.6s(-1). While Sl-PME shows Vmax=0.14mM/min, KM=4.1g/L and kcat=1.7s(-1). A PG inhibitor (PGIP2) weakly interfered in the Sl-EPG activity and Sl-PME was not affected by a usual PME inhibitor. Moreover, these enzymes manifested synergistic action towards methylesterified pectin.

Antibodies to any one DENV serotype which can protect against homotypic re-infection, do not offer heterotypic cross-protection. In fact, cross-reactive antibodies may augment heterotypic DENV infection through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). A recently launched live attenuated vaccine (LAV) for dengue, which consists of a mixture of four chimeric yellow-fever/dengue vaccine viruses, may be linked to the induction of disease-enhancing antibodies. This is likely related to viral interference among the replicating viral strains, resulting in an unbalanced immune response, as well as to the fact that the LAV encodes prM, a DENV protein documented to elicit ADE-mediating antibodies. This makes it imperative to explore the feasibility of alternate ADE risk-free vaccine candidates. Our quest for a non-replicating vaccine centered on the DENV envelope (E) protein which mediates virus entry into the host cell and serves as an important target of the immune response. Serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes and the host receptor recognition function map to E domain III (EDIII). Recently, we found that Pichia pastoris-expressed DENV E protein, of all four serotypes, self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of prM. Significantly, these VLPs displayed EDIII and elicited EDIII-focused DENV-neutralizing antibodies in mice. We now report the creation and characterization of a novel non-replicating recombinant particulate vaccine candidate, produced by co-expressing the E proteins of DENV-1 and DENV-2 in P. pastoris. The two E proteins co-assembled into bivalent mosaic VLPs (mVLPs) designated as mE1E2bv VLPs. The mVLP, which preserved the serotype-specific antigenic integrity of its two component proteins, elicited predominantly EDIII-focused homotypic virus-neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice, demonstrating its efficacy. In an in vivo ADE model, mE1E2bv VLP-induced antibodies lacked discernible ADE potential, compared to the cross-reactive monoclonal antibody 4G2, as evidenced by significant reduction in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, suggesting inherent safety. The results obtained with these bivalent mVLPs suggest the feasibility of incorporating the E proteins of DENV-3 and DENV-4 to create a tetravalent mVLP vaccine.</p></details></div>

Here, we genetically modified the yeast Pichia pastoris to produce the prototypical AMP apidaecin Ia using a fusion protein approach that leverages the beneficial properties (e.g., stability) of human serum albumin. The peptide was successfully isolated from the fusion protein construct, purified, and demonstrated to have bioactivity against Escherichia coli.

Cholesterol is a major component of mammalian cells, where it plays a critical role in membrane permeability, rigidity and dynamics, and contributes to specific membrane structures such as lipid rafts. Cholesterol is the main cargo in low and high-density lipoprotein complexes (i.e. LDL, HDL) and is directly implicated in several pathogenic conditions such as coronary artery disease which leads to 17 million deaths annually. Neutron scattering studies on membranes or lipid-protein complexes exploiting contrast variation have been limited by the lack of availability of fully deuterated biomolecules and especially perdeuterated cholesterol. The availability of perdeuterated cholesterol provides a unique way of probing the structural and dynamical properties of the lipoprotein complexes that underly many of these disease conditions. Here we describe a procedure for in vivo production of perdeuterated recombinant cholesterol in lipid-engineered Pichia pastoris using flask and fed-batch fermenter cultures in deuterated minimal medium. Perdeuteration of the purified cholesterol was verified by mass spectrometry and its use in a neutron scattering study was demonstrated by neutron reflectometry measurements using the FIGAROO instrument at the ILL.</p></details></div>

Preprogaline B was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, after deleting and replacing its original signal peptide with the yeast alpha-factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The secreted recombinant protein was obtained by growing P. pastoris in YPD medium and had the ability to clot milk. The mature form of progaline B is a heterodimeric glycosylated enzyme, with a molecular weight of approximately 48kDa, that contains a heavy (30.7kDa) and a light (13.5kDa) polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. Western blot analysis revealed that progaline B is activated by the acidification of the yeast culture medium and that enzymatic activation requires two steps. First the precursor protein is cleaved into two polypeptide chains by partial removal of the plant-specific insert (PSI) present in plant aspartic proteases; this is later followed by propeptide removal. By altering the pH of the P. pastoris culture medium, we were able to obtain either active or inactive forms of the enzyme. Recombinant progaline B displayed a kappa-casein hydrolysis pattern analogous to those produced by the animal and microbial coagulants currently used in the dairy industry, but it exhibited a different digestion profile on alpha- and beta-caseins.

Komagataella phaffii) is one of the most common eukaryotic expression systems for heterologous protein production. Expression cassettes are typically integrated in the genome to obtain stable expression strains. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where short overhangs are sufficient to target highly specific integration, long overhangs are more efficient in P. pastoris and ectopic integration of foreign DNA can occur. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of ectopic integration by high-throughput screening of >700 transformants and whole-genome sequencing of 27 transformants. Different vector designs and linearization approaches were used to mimic the most common integration events targeted in P. pastoris Fluorescence of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter protein was highly uniform among transformants when the expression cassettes were correctly integrated in the targeted locus. Surprisingly, most nonspecifically integrated transformants showed highly uniform expression that was comparable to specific integration, suggesting that nonspecific integration does not necessarily influence expression. However, a few clones (<10%) harboring ectopically integrated cassettes showed a greater variation spanning a 25-fold range, surpassing specifically integrated reference strains up to 6-fold. High-expression strains showed a correlation between increased gene copy numbers and high reporter protein fluorescence levels. Our results suggest that for comparing expression levels between strains, the integration locus can be neglected as long as a sufficient numbers of transformed strains are compared. For expression optimization of highly expressible proteins, increasing copy number appears to be the dominant positive influence rather than the integration locus, genomic rearrangements, deletions, or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).IMPORTANCE Yeasts are commonly used as biotechnological production hosts for proteins and metabolites. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression cassettes carrying foreign genes integrate highly specifically at the targeted sites in the genome. In contrast, cassettes often integrate at random genomic positions in nonconventional yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). Hence, cells from the same transformation event often behave differently, with significant clonal variation necessitating the screening of large numbers of strains. The importance of this study is that we systematically investigated the influence of integration events in more than 700 strains. Our findings provide novel insight into clonal variation in P. pastoris and, thus, how to avoid pitfalls and obtain reliable results. The underlying mechanisms may also play a role in other yeasts and hence could be generally relevant for recombinant yeast protein production strains.</p></details></div>

This revelation has stimulated research aimed at developing sustainable and green cutinase-catalyzed PET recycling methods. Leaf and branch compost cutinase (LCC) is particularly suited toward these ends given its relatively high PET hydrolysis activity and thermostability. Any practical enzymatic PET recycling application will require that the protein have kinetic stability at or above the PET glass transition temperature (Tg, i.e., 70 degrees C). This paper elucidates the thermodynamics and kinetics of LCC conformational and colloidal stability. Aggregation emerged as a major contributor that reduces LCC kinetic stability. In its native state, LCC is prone to aggregation owing to electrostatic interactions. Further, with increasing temperature, perturbation of LCC's tertiary structure and corresponding exposure of hydrophobic domains leads to rapid aggregation. Glycosylation was employed in an attempt to impede LCC aggregation. Owing to the presence of three putative N-glycosylation sites, expression of native LCC in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production of glycosylated LCC (LCC-G). LCC-G showed improved stability to native state aggregation while increasing the temperature for thermal induced aggregation by 10 degrees C. Furthermore, stabilization against thermal aggregation resulted in improved catalytic PET hydrolysis both at its optimum temperature and concentration.</p></details></div>

However, no vaccine is currently available to prevent EV-D68 infection. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of developing a virus-like particle (VLP)-based EV-D68 vaccine. We found that co-expression of the P1 precursor and 3CD protease of EV-D68 in Pichia pastoris yeast resulted in the generation of EV-D68 VLPs, which were composed of processed VP0, VP1, and VP3 capsid proteins and were visualized as ~30 nm spherical particles. Mice immunized with these VLPs produced serum antibodies capable of specifically neutralizing EV-D68 infections in vitro. The in vivo protective efficacy of the EV-D68 VLP candidate vaccine was assessed in two challenge experiments. The first challenge experiment showed that neonatal mice born to the VLP-immunized dams were fully protected from lethal EV-D68 infection, whereas in the second experiment, passive transfer of anti-VLP sera was found to confer complete protection in the recipient mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate the proof-of-concept for VLP-based broadly effective EV-D68 vaccines.</p></details></div>

At present, antimicrobial peptides have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers. However, antimicrobial peptides often affect a broad range of microorganisms, including the normal flora in a host organism. In the present study, we designed a novel hybrid antimicrobial peptide, expressed the hybrid peptide, and studied its specific target. The hybrid peptide, named T-catesbeianin-1, which includes the FyuA-binding domain of pesticin and the peptide catesbeianin-1, was designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. Then, we determined the antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and specific target of the peptide. T-catesbeianin-1 has strong antimicrobial activity and binds to FyuA to inhibit or kill Escherichia coli present in clinical specimens and mixed-species culture.

Microbial production of high-energy fuels by economically efficient bioprocesses has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional production of transportation fuels. Here, we engineered Pichia pastoris, an industrial workhorse in heterologous enzyme production, to produce the biofuel isobutanol from two renewable carbon sources, glucose and glycerol. Our strategy exploited the yeast's amino acid biosynthetic pathway and diverted the amino acid intermediates to the 2-keto acid degradation pathway for higher alcohol production. To further demonstrate the versatility of our yeast platform, we incorporated a broad-substrate-range alcohol-O-acyltransferase to generate a variety of volatile esters, including isobutyl acetate ester and isopentyl acetate ester. Results: The engineered strain overexpressing the keto-acid degradation pathway was able to produce 284 mg/L of isobutanol when supplemented with 2-ketoisovalerate. To improve the production of isobutanol and eliminate the need to supplement the production media with the expensive 2-ketoisovalerate intermediate, we overexpressed a portion of the amino acid l-valine biosynthetic pathway in the engineered strain. While heterologous expression of the pathway genes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not lead to improvement in isobutanol production in the engineered P. pastoris, overexpression of the endogenous l-valine biosynthetic pathway genes led to a strain that is able to produce 0.89 g/L of isobutanol. Fine-tuning the expression of bottleneck enzymes by employing an episomal plasmid-based expression system further improved the production titer of isobutanol to 2.22 g/L, a 43-fold improvement from the levels observed in the original strain. Finally, heterologous expression of a broad-substrate-range alcohol-O-acyltransferase led to the production of isobutyl acetate ester and isopentyl acetate ester at 51 and 24 mg/L, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, we engineered high-level production of the biofuel isobutanol and the corresponding acetate ester by P. pastoris from readily available carbon sources. We envision that our work will provide an economic route to this important class of compounds and establish P. pastoris as a versatile production platform for fuels and chemicals.</p></details></div>

In this study, a treS gene was fused with the yeast cell-surface anchor protein gene Pir1p by overlap PCR, the Pir1p-treS fusion gene was ligated into pPICZalphaA and pGAPZalphaA and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 to obtain recombinant yeast strains that displays trehalose synthase(TreS) on its cell surface as an efficient and recyclable whole-cell biocatalyst. Firstly, the enhanced green fluorescence protein gene (egfp) was used as the reporter protein to fusion the Pir1p gene and treS gene to construct the recombinant plasmids containing treS-egfg-Pir1p fusion gene, and electrotransformed into P. pastoris GS115 to analyze the surface display characteristics of fusion gene by Western blot, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The analysis shown that the treS-egfg-Pir1p fusion protein can be successfully displayed on the surface of yeast cell, and the expression level increased with the extension of fermentation time. These results implied that the Pir1p-treS fusion gene can be well displayed on the cell surface. Secondly, in order to obtain surface active cells with high enzyme activity, the enzymatic properties of TreS displayed on the cell surface was analyzed, and the fermentation process of recombinant P. patoris GS115 containing pPICZalphaA-Pir1p-treS and pGAPZalphaA-Pir1p-treS was studied respectively. The cell surface display TreS was stable over a broad range of temperatures (10-45 degrees C) and pH (6.0-8.5). The activity of TreS displayed on cell surface respectively reached 1,108 Ug(-1) under PAOX1 control for 150 h, and 1,109 Ug(-1) under PGAP control for 75h in a 5 L fermenter, respectively. Lastly, the cell-surface displayed TreS was used to product trehalose using high maltose syrup as substrate at pH 8.0 and 15 degrees C. The surface display TreS cells can be recycled for three times and the weight conversion rate of trehalose was more than 60%. This paper revealed that the TreS can display on the P. pastoris cell surface and still had a higher catalytic activity after recycled three times, which was suitable for industrial application, especially the preparation of pharmaceutical grade trehalose products.</p></details></div>

Antibodies against DENVs are responsible for both protection as well as pathogenesis. A vaccine that is safe for and efficacious in all people irrespective of their age and domicile is still an unmet need. It is becoming increasingly apparent that vaccine design must eliminate epitopes implicated in the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> We report a Pichia pastoris-expressed dengue immunogen, DSV4, based on DENV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), which contains well-characterized serotype-specific and cross-reactive epitopes. In natural infection, <10% of the total neutralizing antibody response is EDIII-directed. Yet, this is a functionally relevant domain which interacts with the host cell surface receptor. DSV4 was designed by in-frame fusion of EDIII of all four DENV serotypes and hepatitis B surface (S) antigen and co-expressed with unfused S antigen to form mosaic virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs displayed EDIIIs of all four DENV serotypes based on probing with a battery of serotype-specific anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies. The DSV4 VLPs were highly immunogenic, inducing potent and durable neutralizing antibodies against all four DENV serotypes encompassing multiple genotypes, in mice and macaques. DSV4-induced murine antibodies suppressed viremia in AG129 mice and conferred protection against lethal DENV-4 virus challenge. Further, neither murine nor macaque anti-DSV4 antibodies promoted mortality or inflammatory cytokine production when passively transferred and tested in an in vivo dengue disease enhancement model of AG129 mice. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Directing the immune response to a non-immunodominant but functionally relevant serotype-specific dengue epitope of the four DENV serotypes, displayed on a VLP platform, can help minimize the risk of inducing disease-enhancing antibodies while eliciting effective tetravalent seroconversion. DSV4 has a significant potential to emerge as a safe, efficacious and inexpensive subunit dengue vaccine candidate.</p></details></div>

In this study, expressions of the immune-related genes in the midgut of P. xylostella orally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris were profiled by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR approaches. The results revealed that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways and possibly the prophenoloxidase activation system in P. xylostella could be activated by oral infections, and moricins, gloverins and lysozyme2 might act as important effectors against microorganisms. Subsequent knock-down of IMD showed that this gene was involved in regulating the expression of down-stream genes in the IMD pathway.

Biochemical characterization experiments demonstrated that both RsMan26A and RsMan26B are endo-acting enzymes and have a very similar substrate specificity, displaying a higher catalytic efficiency to galactomannan from locust bean gum (LBG) and glucomannan than to beta-1,4-mannan and highly substituted galactomannan from guar gum. Homology modeling of RsMan26A and RsMan26B revealed that each enzyme displays a long open cleft harboring a unique hydrophobic platform (Trp(79)) that stacks against the sugar ring at subsite - 5. The Km values of W79A mutants of RsMan26A and RsMan26B to LBG increased by 4.8-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively, compared with those for the native enzymes, while the kcat remained unchanged or about 40% of that of the native enzyme, resulting in the decrease in the catalytic efficiency by 4.8-fold and 9.1-fold, respectively.

Acquiring control over the natural regulation of promoters is important for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications. In the commonly used protein production host Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris), methanol-inducible promoters are used because of their tight regulation and exceptional strength. Yet, induction with toxic and flammable methanol can be a considerable safety risk and cannot be applied in many existing fermentation plants. Here we studied new regulatory circuits based on the most frequently used alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1 ), which is tightly repressed in presence of repressing carbon sources and strongly induced by methanol. We compared different overexpression strategies for putative carbon source dependent regulators identified by a homology search in related yeasts and previously published literature in order to convert existing methanol dependent expression strains into methanol free systems. While constitutive overexpression showed only marginal or detrimental effects, derepressed expression (activated when the repressing carbon source is depleted) showed that three transcription factors (TFs) are single handedly suitable to strongly activate PAOX1 in P. pastoris without relying on any specifically engineered host strains. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that Mxr1, Mit1, and Prm1 regulate partly overlapping and unique sets of genes. Derepressed overexpression of a single TF was sufficient to retrofit existing PAOX1 based expression strains into glucose/glycerol regulated, methanol-free systems. Given the wide applicability of carbon source regulated promoters, the simplicity and low cost of controlling carbon source feed rates in large scale bioreactors, similar approaches as in P. pastoris may also be useful in other organisms.</p></details></div>

These Interferons induce signal transduction pathways similar to type I Interferons which results in the activation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This group of Interferons are tissue specific and reported to have antiviral activity. In the present communication, we report the expression of bovine IFNlambda3 gene (coding for the mature protein) in Pichia pastoris, purification of the expressed protein and evaluation of its biological activity. About 19kDa protein expressed by the transformed Pichia cells, secreted into the media and the protein was purified by SP-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography with NaCl stepwise gradient elution. Specificity of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Pichia expressed IFNlambda3 was found to be biologically active, as it induced ISGs (Mx protein, OAS and PKR genes) in bovine PBMCs. Further it was also found to modulate Th1/Th2 cytokines expression in the stimulated bovine PBMCs.</p></details></div>

Compared to conventional processes that involve high alkaline and high temperature treatment, enzyme based treatments have significant advantages in fibers protectiveness, improved efficiency of refining, reduced energy consumption and pollution. Hence, it would be highly desirable to construct high-yield alkaline pectate lyase engineered strains and reduce the pectate lyase production cost. In the previous study, pectate lyase gene pel from Bacillus subtilis168 was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 after codon usage optimization based on the vector pHBM905A. To improve the expression level, the vector pHBM905BDM with optimized promoter and signal peptide was used to express the optimized gene pels in GS115. The transformant had increased activity from 68 U/mL to 100 U/mL with the improvement in the transcription level by 27% measured by qPCR. The transformants were further screened on pectin plates, where higher halo forming strains were picked for shake-flask fermentation and strain GS115-pHBM905BDM-pels4 showed the highest activity of 536 U/mL. Then plasmid pPIC9K-pels was constructed and electroporated into the GS115-pHBM905BDM-pels4 cells. Subsequently, high-copy transformant was screened by using the medium containing antibiotics G418, strain GS115-pHBM905BDMpPIC9K- pels1 was identified with increased activity of 770 U/mL and the copy number of pels was 7 confirmed by qPCR. Finally, the activity of pectate lyase produced by GS115-pHBM905BDM-pPIC9K-pels1reached to 2 271 U/mL in a 5-L fermentor.

The low pH solubilizes root-toxic ionic aluminium (Al(3+)) species from clay minerals, driving the evolution of counteractive adaptations in cultivated crops. The food crop Sorghum bicolor upregulates the membrane-embedded transporter protein SbMATE in its roots. SbMATE mediates efflux of the anionic form of the organic acid, citrate, into the soil rhizosphere, chelating Al(3+) ions and thereby imparting Al-resistance based on excluding Al(+3) from the growing root tip. Here, we use electrophysiological, radiolabeled, and fluorescence-based transport assays in two heterologous expression systems to establish a broad substrate recognition profile of SbMATE, showing the proton and/or sodium-driven transport of (14C)-citrate anion, as well as the organic monovalent cation, ethidium, but not its divalent analog, propidium. We further complement our transport assays by measuring substrate binding to detergent-purified SbMATE protein. Finally, we use the purified membrane protein as an antigen to discover native conformation-binding and transport function-altering nanobodies using an animal-free, mRNA/cDNA display technology. Our results demonstrate the utility of using Pichia pastoris as an efficient eukaryotic host to express large quantities of functional plant transporter proteins.

The selectivity of autophagy is determined by autophagy receptors, such as Pichia pastoris Atg30 (autophagy-related 30), which controls the selective degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) through the assembly of a receptor-protein complex (RPC). Previously, we proved that the peroxisomal acyl-CoA-binding protein, Atg37, and the highly conserved peroxin, Pex3, are required for RPC formation and efficient pexophagy. Here, we describe how Atg37 and Pex3 regulate the assembly and activation of the pexophagic RPC. We demonstrate that Atg30 requires both Atg37 and Pex3 to recruit Atg8 and Atg11 to the pexophagic RPC, because Atg37 depends on Pex3 for its localization at the peroxisomal membrane. We establish that due to close proximity of Atg37- and Pex3-binding sites in the middle domain of Atg30, the binding of these proteins to Atg30 is mutually exclusive within this region. We also show that direct binding of Pex3 and Atg37 to Atg30 regulates its phosphorylation by the Hrr25 kinase, negatively and positively, respectively. Based on these results we present a model that clarifies the assembly and activation of the pexophagic RPC through the phosphoregulation of Atg30.</p></details></div>

In addition, it was found that human LYPD8 (hLYPD8) is expressed in the colonic epithelia and expression of hLYPD8 is reduced in some ulcerative colitis patients. However, the molecular characteristics and functions of hLYPD8 remain unclear. In this study, we generated the hLYPD8 protein and characterized its functions. Methods: To analyze the characteristics and functions of the hLYPD8 protein, recombinant FLAG-tagged hLYPD8 protein was generated by two kinds of protein expression systems: a mammalian cell expression system and a Pichia pastoris expression system. Recombinant hLYPD8 protein was analyzed by western blot analysis or deglycosylation assay. The effect of the protein on flagellated bacteria was examined by ELISA assay and motility assay using semi-agar plates. Results: hLYPD8 was a highly N-glycosylated GPI-anchored protein, like mLypd8. Moreover, recombinant hLYPD8 protein generated by the Pichia pastoris expression system using the SuperMan5 strain, which enabled production of a large number of proteins with human-like glycosylation, presented the high binding affinity and the motility inhibitory function to flagellated bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that hLYPD8 inhibits the motile activity of flagellated bacteria, many of which are involved in intestinal inflammation. The supplementation of recombinant hLYPD8 protein might be a novel therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation of inflammatory bowel diseases.</p></details></div>

However, engineering of microorganisms for industrial production of pharmaceuticals using a methanol substrate is still in infancy. In this study, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was used to produce anti-hypercholesterolemia pharmaceuticals, lovastatin and its precursor monacolin J, from methanol. The biosynthetic pathways for monacolin J and lovastatin were first assembled and optimized in single strains using single copies of the relevant biosynthetic genes, and yields of 60.0mg/L monacolin J and 14.4mg/L lovastatin were obtained using methanol following pH controlled monoculture. To overcome limitations imposed by accumulation of intermediates and metabolic stress in monoculture, approaches using pathway splitting and co-culture were developed. Two pathway splitting strategies for monacolin J, and four for lovastatin were tested at different metabolic nodes. Biosynthesis of monacolin J and lovastatin was improved by 55% and 71%, respectively, when the upstream and downstream modules were separately accommodated in two different fluorescent strains, split at the metabolic node of dihydromonacolin L. However, pathway distribution at monacolin J blocked lovastatin biosynthesis in all designs, mainly due to its limited ability of crossing cellular membranes. Bioreactor fermentations were tested for the optimal co-culture strategies, and yields of 593.9mg/L monacolin J and 250.8mg/L lovastatin were achieved. This study provides an alternative method for production of monacolin J and lovastatin and reveals the potential of a methylotrophic yeast to produce complicated pharmaceuticals from methanol.</p></details></div>

K28 is somewhat unique as it represents an alpha/beta heterodimeric protein of the A/B toxin family which, after having bound to the surface of sensitive target cells, is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis and transported through the secretory pathway in a retrograde manner. While the current knowledge on yeast killer toxins is largely based on genetic screens for yeast mutants with altered toxin sensitivity, in vivo imaging of cell surface binding and intracellular toxin transport is still largely hampered by a lack of fluorescently labelled and biologically active killer toxin variants.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, we succeeded for the first time in the heterologous K28 preprotoxin expression and production of fluorescent K28 variants in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant P. pastoris GS115 cells were shown to successfully process and secrete K28 variants fused to mCherry or mTFP by high cell density fermentation. The fluorescent K28 derivatives were obtained in high yield and possessed in vivo toxicity and specificity against sensitive yeast cells. In cell binding studies the resulting K28 variants caused strong fluorescence signals at the cell periphery due to toxin binding to primary K28 receptors within the yeast cell wall. Thereby, the beta-subunit of K28 was confirmed to be the sole component required and sufficient for K28 cell wall binding.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Successful production of fluorescent killer toxin variants of S. cerevisiae by high cell density fermentation of recombinant, K28 expressing strains of P. pastoris now opens the possibility to study and monitor killer toxin cell surface binding, in particular in toxin resistant yeast mutants in which toxin resistance is caused by defects in toxin binding due to alterations in cell wall structure and composition. This novel approach might be easily transferable to other killer toxins from different yeast species and genera. Furthermore, the fluorescent toxin variants described here might likewise represent a powerful tool in future studies to visualize intracellular A/B toxin trafficking with the help of high resolution single molecule imaging techniques.</p></details></div>

Two residues, A160 and A161, located on loop 4, were identified to play roles in catalysis. Mutants A160D/E demonstrated higher affinity to substrate with lower Km values, while mutants A161D/E mainly displayed elevated Vmax values. All of these mutants had significantly improved catalytic efficiency. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, the mutation of A160E was able to affect the important substrate binding site Y204 and then improve the substrate affinity, and the mutation of A161D was capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the substrate to promote the substrate binding or accelerate the product release.

The increase of the transgene dosage from one to nine copies enhanced 7.9-fold the recombinant enzyme (Sa1-SSTrec) yield without causing cell toxicity. Secretion driven by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor signal peptide resulted in periplasmic retention (38%) and extracellular release (62%) of Sa1-SSTrec to an overall activity of 102.1U/ml when biomass reached (106g/l, dry weight) in fed-batch fermentation using cane sugar for cell growth. The volumetric productivity of the nine-copy clone PGFT6x-308 at the end of fermentation (72h) was 1422.2U/l/h. Sa1-SSTrec purified from the culture supernatant was a monomeric glycoprotein optimally active at pH 5.0-6.0 and 45-50 degrees C. The removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by Endo Hf treatment decreased the enzyme stability but had no effect on the substrate and product specificities. Sa1-SSTrec converted sucrose (600g/l) into 1-kestose (GF2) and nystose (GF3) in a ratio 9:1 with their sum representing 55-60% (w/w) of the total carbohydrates in the reaction mixture.

In the present study, Lmlip2 was expressed in the eukaryotic heterologous expression system Pichia pastoris as tagged enzyme of 308 amino acids. Maximal protein production was reached after 2 days of fermentation. Optimal Lmlip2 lipase activity was measured using the pH stat technique at pH 8at 26 degrees C using vinyl esters and triacylglycerols (true lipids) as substrates. Moreover, biochemical characterization of Lmlip2 contained in culture supernatant, illustrates that L. major secreted lipase is active and stable at low temperatures especially 26 degrees and prefer neutral pH; concerning substrate specificityLmlip2 presents a preference for short chains lipid substrates vinyl esters such as VC2, VC3 and VC4 likewise, it is capable to hydrolyze long chain triacylglycerols like olive oil. Metal ions and surfactants tested in this study decrease Lmlip2 activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the relation between the lipase activity and the virulence.

Heterobasidion irregulare is a white-rot phytopathogenic fungus that causes wood decay in conifers. The genome of this fungus encodes 10 putative Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs. We describe the first biochemical characterization of H. irregulare LPMOs through heterologous expression of two CBM-containing LPMOs from this fungus (HiLPMO9H, HiLPMO9I) in Pichia pastoris. The oxidization preferences and substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined. The two LPMOs were shown to cleave different carbohydrate components of plant cell walls. HiLPMO9H was active on cellulose and oxidized the substrate at the C1 carbon of the pyranose ring at beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas HiLPMO9I cleaved cellulose with strict oxidization at the C4 carbon of glucose unit at internal bonds, and also showed activity against glucomannan. We propose that the two LPMOs play different roles in the plant-cell-wall degrading system of H. irregulare for degradation of softwood and that the lignocellulose degradation mediated by this white-rot fungus may require collective efforts from multi-types of LPMOs.</p></details></div>

The amino acid sequence of XynF1 had 99% coverage and 95% homology to the endo-beta-1,4-xylanase encoded by the cellulase gene of Orpinomyces sp. LT-3 (GenBank accession No. AEO51791.1). The amino acid sequence of EglF2 had 99% coverage and 93% homology to the beta-glucosidase encoded by the cellulase gene of Piromyces sp. E2 (GenBank accession No. CAC34952.1). Analysis using the SMART software showed that XynF1 contains a glycoside hydrolase family 11 functional module and a carbohydrate-binding module, while EglF2 contains a glycoside hydrolase family 1 functional module. XynF1 showed the highest relative enzymatic activity, up to 95%, at 45 degrees C and pH 4.2, while EglF2 showed the highest relative enzymatic activity, up to 95%, at 55 degrees C and pH 6.2.

Komagataella spp.) include overexpression of homologous and heterologous genes, and deletion of host genes. For metabolic and cell engineering purposes the simultaneous overexpression of more than one gene would often be required. Very recently, Golden Gate based libraries were adapted to optimize single expression cassettes for recombinant proteins in P. pastoris. However, an efficient toolbox allowing the overexpression of multiple genes at once was not available for P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> With the GoldenPiCS system, we provide a flexible modular system for advanced strain engineering in P. pastoris based on Golden Gate cloning. For this purpose, we established a wide variety of standardized genetic parts (20 promoters of different strength, 10 transcription terminators, 4 genome integration loci, 4 resistance marker cassettes).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> All genetic parts were characterized based on their expression strength measured by eGFP as reporter in up to four production-relevant conditions. The promoters, which are either constitutive or regulatable, cover a broad range of expression strengths in their active conditions (2-192% of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter P GAP ), while all transcription terminators and genome integration loci led to equally high expression strength. These modular genetic parts can be readily combined in versatile order, as exemplified for the simultaneous expression of Cas9 and one or more guide-RNA expression units. Importantly, for constructing multigene constructs (vectors with more than two expression units) it is not only essential to balance the expression of the individual genes, but also to avoid repetitive homologous sequences which were otherwise shown to trigger "loop-out" of vector DNA from the P. pastoris genome.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> GoldenPiCS, a modular Golden Gate-derived P. pastoris cloning system, is very flexible and efficient and can be used for strain engineering of P. pastoris to accomplish pathway expression, protein production or other applications where the integration of various DNA products is required. It allows for the assembly of up to eight expression units on one plasmid with the ability to use different characterized promoters and terminators for each expression unit. GoldenPiCS vectors are available at Addgene.</p></details></div>

A putative cellulase gene (cbGH5) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 46 (GH5_46) was identified and cloned by degenerate PCR plus genome walking. The CbGH5 protein was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. It is the first bifunctional cellulase-xylanase reported in GH5_46 as well as in Chryseobacterium genus. The enzyme showed an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose of 3237 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 9, 90 degrees C and a xylanase activity on birchwood xylan of 1793 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 8, 90 degrees C. The activity level and thermophilicity are in the front rank of all the known cellulases and xylanases. Core hydrophobicity had a positive effect on the thermophilicity of this enzyme. When similar quantity of enzymatic activity units was applied on the straws of wheat, rice, corn and oilseed rape, CbGH5 could obtain 3.5-5.0x glucose and 1.2-1.8x xylose than a mixed commercial cellulase plus xylanase of Novozymes. When applied on spent mushroom substrates made from the four straws, CbGH5 could obtain 9.2-15.7x glucose and 3.5-4.3x xylose than the mixed Novozymes cellulase+xylanase.

However, it cannot be directly metabolized by most microbes including Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris), which is a frequently employed host for heterologous protein expression and production of high-value compounds. A K. phaffii strain was engineered that constitutively co-expresses an endoglucanase and a beta-glucosidase both from Aspergillus niger and an exoglucanase from Trichoderma reesei under the control of bidirectional promoters. This engineered strain was able to grow on cellobiose and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) but not on Avicel. However, the detected release of cellobiose from Avicel by using the produced mixture of endoglucanase and exoglucanase as well as the released glucose from Avicel by using the produced mixture of all three cellulases at 50 degrees C indicated the production of exoglucanase under the liquid culture conditions.

Currently, subunit vaccines based on VP2 antigen expressed in prokaryotic systems are widely used in clinical settings. However, the immunogenicity of VP2 vaccines is limited because of their inherent defect that the structure of the antigen expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) may be different from its natural conformation. In this study, we fused VP2 and VP5 protective antigen genes and linked the chicken IgY Fc gene onto it. The eukaryotic expression plasmid carrying the fusion gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) to express the recombinant VP2-VP5-Fc protein. The recombinant protein was used as immunogen for evaluating immune response, and the recombinant VP2-Fc and VP2 proteins expressed in P. pastoris and the commercial VP2 subunit vaccines were used as controls. Moreover, Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), an immunomodulator found by our laboratory, was used as adjuvant to investigate its immune modulatory effects on immunogens. Chickens were divided into six groups and inoculated with VP2-VP5-Fc+TPPPS, VP2-VP5-Fc, VP2-Fc, VP2 vaccine, commercial VP2 subunit vaccine, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The recombinant VP2 subunit vaccine expressed in P. pastoris exhibited higher immunogenicity than the commercial VP2 subunit vaccine. The VP2-Fc protein showed a better effect than the VP2 protein, and the VP2-VP5-Fc subunit further improved the immune effects. In addition, TPPPS was proved to be a good immunopotentiator for the VP2-VP5-Fc subunit vaccine.

It is activated by various stresses, including hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, high-temperature stress and exposure to arsenite. Hog1, the crucial MAP kinase of the pathway, localizes to the nucleus in response to high osmotic concentrations, i.e. high osmolarity; but, otherwise, little is known about its intracellular dynamics and regulation. By using the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii, we found that CbHog1-Venus formed intracellular dot structures after high-temperature stress in a reversible manner. Microscopic observation revealed that CbHog1-mCherry colocalized with CbPab1-Venus, a marker protein of stress granules. Hog1 homologs in Pichia pastoris and Schizosaccharomyces pombe also exhibited similar dot formation under high-temperature stress, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hog1 (ScHog1)-GFP did not. Analysis of CbHog1-Venus in C. boidinii revealed that a beta-sheet structure in the N-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for its localization to stress granules. Physiological studies revealed that sequestration of activated Hog1 proteins in stress granules was responsible for downregulation of Hog1 activity under high-temperature stress.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.</p></details></div>

In the present work, we describe the construction of recombinant (r) common carp (Cyprinus carpio; c) FSH (rcFSH) and LH (rcLH) using the Pichia pastoris system, the generation of specific antibodies against their respective beta subunits, and their use in the development and validation of specific ELISAs. We produced carp rLH and rFSH as single-chain polypeptides, wherein the GTH subunit alpha was joined with either cLHbeta or cFSHbeta mature protein-coding sequences to form a fusion gene that encodes a yoked polypeptide, in which the GTH beta-subunit forms the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit forms the C-terminal part. Competitive ELISAs were developed, using primary antibodies against rcLHbeta or rcFSHbeta, respectively, and rcLHbetaalpha or rcFSHbetaalpha for the standard curves. The standard curves for cLH paralleled those of pituitary extracts of the homologous fish and also those of other cyprinids species like the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). We used the specific antibodies raised against cFSH and cLH to study the specific localization of the different GTH cells in the pituitary of carp and its taxonomic relative species - the zebrafish. Both FSH and LH cells are localized in the center of the proximal pars distalis enveloping both sides of the neurohypophysis. LH cells form a continuous population throughout the PPD, while FSH cells are more loosely distributed throughout the same area and form small aggregations. Marked annual changes were encountered in gonadosomatic index (GSI), follicle diameter, mRNA levels and protein levels of FSH and LH. From September to November, all fish had low GSI, and the ovary contained previtellogenic follicles. From December, the GSI level increased and remained high until March, the follicular diameter reached its maximum in January, where the ovary contained large fully grown follicles. Thereafter, spawning occurred through March and April and ended in May, and GSI level and follicle diameter increased again; and the ovary contained mid-vitellogenic follicles. LH pituitary content and mRNA levels were low at pre- and early vitellogenesis, increasing gradually during this process to reach a peak of LH mRNA levels in mid vitellogenic ovary and a peak of LH content in fully grown ovarian follicles. However, no significant change occurred in FSH pituitary content and mRNA levels in vitellogenic fish and in fish during final maturation stages. A dramatic difference was found in the total content of each gonadotropin in the pituitary, with higher LH than FSH. Moreover, follicle diameter was positively and significantly correlated with LH pituitary content and its transcript levels - but not with the pituitary content or mRNA levels of FSH. Taken together, these results indicate that in carp, LH alone is sufficient to regulate both vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation while FSH may have another, yet undefined role.</p></details></div>

Then, Bgal1-3 was secreted from Pichia pastoris X33 under the direction of an alpha-factor signal peptide. After cultivation for 144 h in a flask culture with shaking, the extracellular activity of Bgal1-3 was 4.4 U/mL. Five more signal peptides (HFBI, apre, INU1A, MF4I, and W1) were employed to direct the secretion, giving rise to a more efficient signal peptide, W1 (11.2 U/mL). To further improve the secretion yield, recombinant strains harboring two copies of the bgal1-3 gene were constructed, improving the extracellular activity to 22.6 U/mL (about 440 mg/L).

These VHHs possess unique structural and functional features, as they are small in size and exhibit thermal stability and high solubility. Compared to conventional antibodies, VHHs can be manufactured in microorganisms to significantly save on cost, labor, and time since VHHs lack the Fc domain with its N-linked oligosaccharide. Until now, VHHs have been expressed in several kinds of production systems, ranging from prokaryotic cells, yeasts, fungi, insect cells, and mammalian cell lines, to plants. In this review, we focus on the recent production of VHHs, introduce different platforms, and summarize the current state of this area and its future trends. Finally, the first potential VHH product, produced in Pichia pastoris, will probably be available on the market in 2018; thus, it is of great importance to give this antibody fragment timely attention.

However, overexpression of recombinant protein often leads to severe burden on the physiology of K. phaffii and triggers cellular stress. To elucidate the global effect of protein overexpression, we set out to analyze the differential transcriptome of recombinant strains with 12 copies and a single copy of phospholipase A2 gene (PLA 2) from Streptomyces violaceoruber. Through GO, KEGG and heat map analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes, the results indicated that the 12-copy strain suffered heavy cellular stress. The genes involved in protein processing and stress response were significantly upregulated due to the burden of protein folding and secretion, while the genes in ribosome and DNA replication were significantly downregulated possibly contributing to the reduced cell growth rate under protein overexpression stress. Three most upregulated heat shock response genes (CPR6, FES1, and STI1) were co-overexpressed in K. phaffii and proved their positive effect on the secretion of reporter enzymes (PLA2 and prolyl endopeptidase) by increasing the production up to 1.41-fold, providing novel helper factors for rational engineering of K. phaffii.</p></details></div>

FAEs as auxiliary enzymes significantly assist xylanolytic and pectinolytic enzymes in gaining access to their site of action during biomass saccharification for biofuel and biochemical production. A limited number of FAEs have been functionally characterized compared to over 1000 putative fungal FAEs that were recently predicted by similarity-based genome mining, which divided phylogenetically into different subfamilies (SFs). In this study, 27 putative and six characterized FAEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were selected and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant proteins biochemically characterized to validate the previous genome mining and phylogenetical grouping and to expand the information on activity of fungal FAEs. As a result, 20 enzymes were shown to possess FAE activity, being active towards pNP-ferulate and/or methyl hydroxycinnamate substrates, and covering 11 subfamilies. Most of the new FAEs showed activities comparable to those of previously characterized fungal FAEs.</p></details></div>

This study systematically investigated the capacity of different biotechnically relevant yeast species and strains including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Candida glabrata to initiate maturation of human DC. As important prerequisite for T-cell activation, all yeasts were shown to effectively induce, though to a different extent, the expression of the activation marker CD83, the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, CD54, CD58, and CD40, as well as the antigen-presenting molecules MHCs I and II. Furthermore, yeast-activated DC secreted various cytokines including inflammatory TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta or T-cell polarizing IL-12, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-27. Variability was observed in the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in response to the tested yeasts, whereas expression levels of IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 were similar. Interestingly, maturation marker expression and cytokine secretion were not negatively affected after application of yeast mutants with altered cell wall mannoprotein structure (Deltamnn11) or defective in protein N-glycosylation (Deltaost3), indicating that elongated cell wall mannoproteins at the outer yeast cell surface are not a prerequisite for the observed yeast-mediated DC maturation.

In this study, six different NK-lysin genes (nkl1, nkl2, nkl3, nkl4, nkl5 and nkl6) were identified in the common carp genome. Each of the mature peptides of common carp NK-lysin has six well-conserved cysteine residues, and shares a Saposin B domain, characteristic of saposin-like protein (SALIP) family. The gene nkl1 contains 5 extrons and 4 introns, and nkl2, nkl3, nkl4 or nkl5 contains 4 extrons and 3 introns, however, the nkl6 has 3 extrons and 2 introns. By quantitative real-time PCR, nkl2 transcripts were predominantly expressed in spleen of healthy common carp, while elevated mainly in gill and spleen upon Aeromonas hydrophila infection. The recombinant NK-lysin-2 purified from Pichia pastoris shows antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli M15, Aeromonas hydrophila, as well as Edwardsiella tarda (Gram-negative), the latter two are important pathogens of aquaculture. Our results indicate that NK-lysin in common carp might play an important role in fish immune response by enhancing antibacterial defense against bacterial pathogens.</p></details></div>

In the past recent years, important breakthroughs in the systems-level quantitative analysis of its physiology have been achieved. This wealth of information has allowed the development of genome-scale metabolic models, which make new approaches possible for host cell and bioprocess engineering. Nevertheless, the predictive accuracy of the previous consensus model required to be upgraded and validated with new experimental data sets for P. pastoris growing on glycerol or methanol as sole carbon sources, two of the most relevant substrates for this cell factory. In this study, we have characterized P. pastoris growing in chemostat cultures using glycerol or methanol as sole carbon sources over a wide range of growth rates, thereby providing physiological data on the effect of growth rate and culture conditions on biomass macromolecular and elemental composition. In addition, these data sets were used to improve the performance of the P. pastoris consensus genomic-scale metabolic model iMT1026. Thereupon, new experimentally determined bounds, including the representation of biomass composition for these growth conditions, have been incorporated. As a result, here, we present version 3 (v3.0) of the consensus P. pastoris genome-scale metabolic model as an update of the iMT1026 model. The v3.0 model was validated for growth on glycerol and methanol as sole carbon sources, demonstrating improved prediction capabilities over an extended substrate range including two biotechnologically relevant carbon sources.</p></details></div>

Fructan can also be hydrolyzed by plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), but these enzymes have not been used to produce fructose commercially. Two Ht1-FEHs (Ht1-FEH I and Ht1-FEH II) were recently characterized in Jerusalem artichoke. In this study, we cloned the third member of the Ht1-FEH family in Jerusalem artichoke (i.e., Ht1-FEH III). When heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33, Ht1-FEH III not only demonstrated hydrolysis activity towards beta (2, 1)-linked fructans and beta (2, 6)-linked levan, but also towards sucrose. To explore the potential industrial applications, we heterologously expressed and purified six plant 1-FEHs from two typical fructan plants (i.e., chicory and Jerusalem artichoke) and showed that chicory Ci1-FEH IIa had the highest hydrolysis capacity to fructan in vitro. Furthermore, we immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa on resin and optimized the immobilization conditions. We found that inulin-type fructan or the tuber extract from Jerusalem artichoke could be rapidly degraded into fructose and sucrose by immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa. The capacity of Ci1-FEH IIa to release fructose from fructans was comparable to that of some inulinases from microorganisms. Thus, plant FEHs have potential applications in fructose production.</p></details></div>

This success story is linked to its specific physiological traits, i.e., the ability to grow at high cell density in inexpensive culture medium and to secrete proteins at high yield. Exploiting methanol metabolism is at the core of most P. pastoris-based processes but comes with its own challenges. Co-feeding cultures with glycerol/sorbitol and methanol is a promising approach, which can benefit from improved understanding and prediction of metabolic response. The development of profitable processes relies on the construction and selection of efficient producing strains from less efficient ones but also depends on the ability to master the bioreactor process itself.

Despite its high protein productivity, the optimization of P. pastoris cultivation is still imperative due to strain- and product-specific challenges such as promoter strength, methanol utilization type and oxygen demand. To address the issues, strategies involving genetic and process engineering have been employed. Optimization of codon usage and gene dosage, as well as engineering of promoters, protein secretion pathways and methanol metabolic pathways have proved beneficial to innate protein expression levels. Large-scale production of proteins via high cell density fermentation additionally relies on the optimization of process parameters including methanol feed rate, induction temperature and specific growth rate. Recent progress related to the enhanced production of proteins in P. pastoris via various genetic engineering and cultivation strategies are reviewed. Insight into the regulation of the P. pastoris alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and the development of methanol-free systems are highlighted. Novel cultivation strategies such as mixed substrate feeding are discussed. Recent advances regarding substrate and product monitoring techniques are also summarized. Application of P. pastoris to the production of biodiesel and other value-added products via metabolic engineering are also reviewed. P. pastoris is becoming an indispensable platform through the use of these combined engineering strategies.</p></details></div>

As a first step towards understanding the structure, function and regulation of this PLA2, we report the expression and characterization of PLA2-V from chicken (ChPLA2-V). The ChPLA2-V cDNA was synthesized from chicken heart polyA mRNA by RT-PCR, and an expression construct containing the PLA2 was established. After expression in Pichia pastoris cells, the active enzyme was purified. The purified ChPLA2-V protein was biochemically and physiologically characterized. The recombinant ChPLA2-V has an absolute requirement for Ca(2+) for enzymatic activity. The optimum pH for this enzyme is pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer with phosphatidylcholine as substrate. ChPLA2-V was found to display potent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bactericidal activity and antifungal activity in vitro. The purified enzyme ChPLA2-V with much stronger anticoagulant activity compared with the intestinal and pancreatic chicken PLA2-V was approximately 10 times more active. Chicken group V PLA2, like mammal one, may be considered as a future therapeutic agents against fungal and bacterial infections and as an anticoagulant agent.</p></details></div>

The carbohydrate moieties of AGPs consist of beta-1,3-galactan main chains and beta-1,6-galactan side chains, to which other auxiliary sugars are attached. To date, FvEn3GAL isolated from Flammulina velutipes is the sole beta-1,3-galactanase acting on beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner. Here we cloned two homologous genes, designated Af3G and NcEn3GAL, possibly encoding endo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Aspergillus flavus and Neurospora crassa, respectively. The recombinant Af3G (rAf3G) and rNcEn3GAL expressed in Pichia pastoris specifically hydrolyzed beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner, as did the rFvEn3GAL. Among galactooligosaccharides, beta-1,3-galactotriose was identified as the smallest substrate for these enzymes. These results suggest that enzymatic characteristics are conserved in many endo-beta-1,3-galactanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 16 family. On the other hand, rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL generated more beta-1,3-galactobiose from beta-1,3-galactotetraose than did rFvEn3GAL, suggesting that rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL prefer hydrolyzing the central beta-1,3-glycosidic linkage of three in beta-1,3-galactotetraose. Although rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL alone hardly hydrolyze native AGP, they acted synergistically with a fungal exo-beta-1,3-galactanase on the AGP. These endo-beta-1,3-galactanases presumably aid hydrolysis by internally breaking up AGPs, which creates more sites of attack for exo-beta-1,3-galactanase.</p></details></div>

Recently, three prophylactic HPV vaccines targeting high-risk HPVs (particularly HPV16 and HPV18) have been implemented to protect younger women. However, individuals with pre-existing infections have no benefit from prophylactic vaccines. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic vaccines. HPV16 E7 has been widely utilized as a target for immune therapy of HPV16-associated lesions or cancers, reflecting the sustained existence of this virus in cancerous cells. We developed mannosylated HPV16 E7 (mE7) expressed from Pichia pastoris as a therapeutic vaccine against HPV16-associated cancer. Unmannosylated E7 (E7) was also generated from Pichia pastoris as a control. Mannosylation enhanced the uptake of mE7 by mannose receptors of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), while the uptake of E7 was unaffected. mE7-uptake BMDCs in vitro induced more IFN-gamma secretion by splenocytes of immunized mice than E7. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with mE7 combined with adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) elicited stronger Th1 (type 1 T helper cell) responses and E7-specific T cell responses than E7. The mE7 vaccine induced the increased production of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha, elicited more E7-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T cells in spleen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and promoted stronger E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses compared with E7. Furthermore, TC-1 tumor challenged mice were used to confirm the antitumor activity of the vaccines. As a result, mE7 generated complete antitumor activity against TC-1 tumors, while E7 only provided partial antitumor activity. Taken together, mE7 can be a promising immunotherapy for treating cervical cancer.</p></details></div>

The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) strategy was used to further confirm the genome integration of hIL-3 expression cassette. From shake flask expression studies, the recombinant hIL-3 concentration in culture supernatant increased upto 8 copies to a level of 310mg/L, thereafter a considerably lower expression was observed.

In fact, this is an unusual reaction given the unfavorable conditions for dehydration. This characteristic strongly contributes to the potential of SBLE to become a 'green' tool in industrial applications. Indeed, lactonization occurs normally in organic solvents, an application for which microbial lipases are increasingly used as biocatalysts. Previously, we described the production of recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). However, expression was not optimal to delve deeper into the enzyme's potential for industrial application. In the current study, we explored codon-optimization of the SBLE gene and we optimized the rSBLE expression protocol. Temperature reduction had the biggest impact followed by codon-optimization and co-expression of the HAC1 transcription factor. Combining these approaches, we achieved a 32-fold improvement of the yield during rSBLE production (from 0.75 mg/l to 24 mg/L culture) accompanied with a strong reduction of contaminants after affinity purification.</p></details></div>

Treatment with rMnP or manganese(III) acetate reduced furfural and HMF concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Furfural disappearance was accompanied by malonate disappearance and accumulation of four distinct degradation products. Furfural was more readily degraded by rMnP and manganese(III) acetate than HMF. Growth assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that rMnP treatment reduced the toxicity of furfural and HMF.

DSC measurements showed that the Tm values of FabDeltaSS were approximately 5 degrees C lower than those of wild-type Fab, suggesting that the interchain disulfide bond contributes to conformational thermostability.

In addition, the recent popularity of using a continuous process for production of biopharmaceuticals, the traditional bottom-up method, alone for product characterization and quality analysis is no longer sufficient. Bottom-up method requires large amounts of material for analysis and is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Additionally, in this analysis, digestion of the protein with enzymes such as trypsin could induce artifacts and modifications which would increase the complexity of the analysis. On the other hand, a top-down method requires a minimum amount of sample and allows for analysis of the intact protein mass and sequence generated from fragmentation within the instrument. However, fragmentation usually occurs at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein with less internal fragmentation. Herein, we combine the use of the complementary techniques, a top-down and bottom-up method, for the characterization of human growth hormone degradation products. Notably, our approach required small amounts of sample, which is a requirement due to the sample constraints of small scale manufacturing. Using this approach, we were able to characterize various protein variants, including post-translational modifications such as oxidation and deamidation, residual leader sequence, and proteolytic cleavage. Thus, we were able to highlight the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches, which achieved the characterization of a wide range of product variants in samples of human growth hormone secreted from Pichia pastoris.</p></details></div>

In the present study, the gene of a previously characterized transmembrane protein glycerol transporter 1 (GT1) of P. pastoris GS115 was deleted by homologous recombination. Transcriptional profiles of the mutant (gt1Delta) and wild type (WT) were compared with different carbon sources (glycerol, methanol and glycerol-methanol mix) at various time points using high-throughput RNA-Seq techniques. We determined that the loss of glycerol transporter 1 (Gt1p) could relieve catabolite repression in the glycerol-methanol mixed medium and shared a similar transcriptional profile with the WT in methanol medium. By calculating the common differentially expressed genes in three distinct paired groups, genes involved in the stress response, nutrition deprivation and translational process were identified, explaining the potential roles of glycerol in the regulation of methanol metabolism. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis, the relationship between biological traits and the transcriptional profile was established. With the support of published research and our data, we propose two possible regulatory pathways that are involved in the regulation of catabolite repression (adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase /SNF1 and Mitogen-activated protein kinase/HOG), thereby providing potential targets for both research and industrial strain improvement.</p></details></div>

Pichia pastoris) is one of the most commonly used host systems for recombinant protein expression. Achieving targeted genetic modifications had been hindered by low frequencies of homologous recombination (HR). Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has been implemented for P. pastoris enabling gene knockouts based on indels (insertion, deletions) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at near 100% efficiency. However, specifically integrating homologous donor cassettes via HR for replacement studies had proven difficult resulting at most in approximately 20% correct integration using CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we demonstrate the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated integration of markerless donor cassettes at efficiencies approaching 100% using a ku70 deletion strain. The Ku70p is involved in NHEJ repair and lack of the protein appears to favor repair via HR near exclusively. While the absolute number of transformants in the Deltaku70 strain is reduced, virtually all surviving transformants showed correct integration. In the wildtype strain, markerless donor cassette integration was also improved up to 25-fold by placing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) on the donor cassette. Alternative strategies for improving donor cassette integration using a Cas9 nickase variant or reducing off targeting associated toxicity using a high fidelity Cas9 variant were so far not successful in our hands in P. pastoris. Furthermore we provide Cas9/gRNA expression plasmids with a Geneticin resistance marker which proved to be versatile tools for marker recycling. The reported CRSIPR-Cas9 tools can be applied for modifying existing production strains and also pave the way for markerless whole genome modification studies in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Herein, the surface charge properties of HGFI, a class I hydrophobin from Grifola frondosa, were altered by replacing the negatively charged Glu24 with a positively charged Lys to generate the ME24 mutant. Pichia pastoris GS115 was used for recombinant expression of the ME24 mutant, which was purified by a two-step procedure. The function of the mutated residue in HGFI self-assembly was investigated. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that the polarity of ME24 was enhanced compared with HGFI. Circular dichroism, thioflavin T assay, water contact angle and atomic force microscopy indicated that Glu24 participates in rodlet formation. Water solubility detection and dynamic light scattering showed that Glu24 affects the assembled state of HGFI in aqueous solution. The behaviour of the mutant in an emulsion, in the dispersion of insoluble materials and in large-scaled protein production suggests the functions of hydrophobins can be tuned for new applications.</p></details></div>

Two mating-type (MAT) loci include homologs of the MATa and MATalpha transcription factor genes, with the expression from one locus downregulated by telomere position effects. However, not much is known about mating gene regulation, since the mixture of mating types complicates detailed investigations. In this study, we developed K. phaffii strains with stable mating types by deletion of the inverted-repeat region required for mating-type switching. These heterothallic strains retain their ability to mate with cells of the opposite mating type and were used to further elucidate mating gene regulation. Functional analysis of MAT mutant strains revealed the essential role of MATa2 and MATalpha1 in diploid cell formation. Disruption of MATa1 or MATalpha2 did not affect mating; however, in diploid cells, both genes are required for sporulation and the repression of shmoo formation.

To explore additional GE enzymes, we used a genome mining strategy. BLAST analysis with characterized GEs against approximately 250 publicly accessible fungal genomes identified more than 150 putative fungal GEs, which were classified into eight phylogenetic sub-groups. To validate the genome mining strategy, 21 selected GEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. Of these enzymes, 18 were active against benzyl d-glucuronate demonstrating the suitability of our genome mining strategy for enzyme discovery.</p></details></div>

In mammals and yeast, several PMPs traffic via the ER in a Pex3- and Pex19-dependent manner. In Komagataella phaffii (formerly called Pichia pastoris) specifically, the indirect traffic of Pex2, but not of Pex11 or Pex17, depends on Pex3, but all PMPs tested for indirect trafficking require Pex19. In mammals, the indirect traffic of PMPs also requires PEX16, a protein that is absent in most yeast species. In this study, we isolated PEX36, a new gene in K. phaffii, which encodes a PMP. Pex36 is required for cell growth in conditions that require peroxisomes for the metabolism of certain carbon sources. This growth defect in cells lacking Pex36 can be rescued by the expression of human PEX16, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex34, or by overexpression of the endogenous K. phaffii Pex25. Pex36 is not an essential protein for peroxisome proliferation, but in the absence of the functionally redundant protein, Pex25, it becomes essential and less than 20% of these cells show import-incompetent, peroxisome-like structures (peroxisome remnants). In the absence of both proteins, peroxisome biogenesis and the intra-ER sorting of Pex2 and Pex11C are seriously impaired, likely by affecting Pex3 and Pex19 function.</p></details></div>

The phytase showed 38% identity with Aspergillus niger PhyB, which was the closest hit. The M. importuna phytase was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and characterized. The phytase had an optimum temperature at 25 degrees C, which is the lowest among all the known phytases to our best knowledge. The optimum pH (6.5) is higher than most of the known HAP phytases, which is fit for the weak acidic condition in fish gut. At the optimum pH and temperature, MiPhyA showed the maximum activity level (2,384.6 +/- 90.4 mumol.min(-)(1).mg(-)(1), suggesting that the enzyme possesses a higher activity level over many known phytases at low temperatures. The phytate-degrading efficacy was tested on three common feed materials (soybean meal/rapeseed meal/corn meal) and was compared with the well-known phytases of Escherichia coli and A. niger. When using the same amount of activity units, MiPhyA could yield at least 3x more inorganic phosphate than the two reference phytases. When using the same weight of protein, MiPhyA could yield at least 5x more inorganic phosphate than the other two. Since it could degrade phytate in feed materials efficiently under low temperature and weak acidic conditions, which are common for aquacultural application, MiPhyA might be a promising candidate as a feed additive enzyme.</p></details></div>

By rationally introducing hydrophobic mutations into the N-terminus of SGT Exmt (R145I), replacing the propeptide with FPVDDDDK and engineering the alpha-factor signal peptide, trypsin production (amidase activity) was improved to 177.85+/-2.83U.mL(-1) in a 3-L fermenter (a 3.75-fold increase).

Quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed LEG-1 to be almost exclusively transcribed and expressed in parasitic lungworm stages. Immunohistochemistry localized the enzyme in the parasite's gut, which was confirmed by immunoblots detecting LEG-1 in the gut as well as male testes. LEG-1 was recombinantly (rLEG-1) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and subsequently analysed in activity assays for its enzyme functions and substrate specificity. For sufficient functionality, rLEG-1 needed trans-activation through D. viviparus cathepsin L-2, indicating a novel mechanism of legumain activation. After trans-activation, rLEG-1 worked best at pH 5.5 and 35-39 degrees C and cleaved a legumain-specific artificial substrate as well as the natural substrates bovine collagen types I and II. In a clinical vaccination trial, rLEG-1 did not protect against challenge infection. Results of in vitro characterization, transcription pattern and localization enhance the presumption that LEG-1 participates in digestion processes of D. viviparus. Since rLEG-1 needs trans-activation through a cathepsin, it is probably involved in an enzyme cascade and therefore remains interesting as a candidate in a multi-component vaccine.</p></details></div>

Dietary exposure of a pesticide mixture (organophosphates - chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, pyrethroid - cypermethrin; 2-15ppm each) to H. armigera larvae resulted in a dose dependant up-regulation of GST activity and gene expression. A variant GST from H. armigera (HaGST-8) was isolated from larvae fed with 10ppm pesticide mixture and it was recombinantly expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris HaGST-8). HaGST-8 had a molecular mass of 29kDa and was most active at pH 9 at 30 degrees C. GC-MS and LC-HRMS analysis validated that HaGST-8 was effective in eliminating organophosphate type of pesticides and partially reduced the cypermethrin content (53%) from aqueous solutions. Unlike the untransformed yeast, P. pastoris HaGST-8 grew efficiently in media supplemented with pesticide mixtures (200 and 400ppm each pesticide) signifying the detoxification ability of HaGST-8. The amino acid sequence of HaGST-8 and the already reported sequence of HaGST-7 had just 2 mismatches. The studies on molecular interaction strengths revealed that HaGST-8 had stronger binding affinities with organophosphate, pyrethroid, organochloride, carbamate and neonicotinoid type of pesticides. The abilities of recombinant HaGST-8 to eliminate pesticides and P. pastoris HaGST-8 to grow profusely in the presence of high level of pesticide content can be applied for removal of such residues from food, water resources and bioremediation.</p></details></div>

However, optimizing conditions of the large-scale high-cell-density fermentation for biochemistry and industrialization is usually a laborious and time-consuming process. Furthermore, it is often difficult to produce authentic proteins in large quantities, which is a major obstacle for functional and structural features analysis and industrial application. For these reasons, we have developed a protocol for efficient demonstration-scale high-cell-density fermentation of P. pastoris, which employs a new methanol-feeding strategy-biomass-stat strategy and a strategy of increased air pressure instead of pure oxygen supplement. The protocol included three typical stages of glycerol batch fermentation (initial culture phase), glycerol fed-batch fermentation (biomass accumulation phase), and methanol fed-batch fermentation (induction phase), which allows direct online-monitoring of fermentation conditions, including broth pH, temperature, DO, anti-foam generation, and feeding of glycerol and methanol. Using this protocol, production of the recombinant beta-xylosidase of Lentinula edodes origin in 1000-L scale fermentation can be up to ~900 mg/L or 9.4 mg/g cells (dry cell weight, intracellular expression), with the specific production rate and average specific production of 0.1 mg/g/h and 0.081 mg/g/h, respectively. The methodology described in this protocol can be easily transferred to other systems, and eligible to scale up for a large number of proteins used in either the scientific studies or commercial purposes.</p></details></div>

We have developed a unique system applying the strain of the yeast Pichia pastoris, where the endogenous aquaporins/aquaglyceroporins have been removed and human aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are recombinantly expressed enabling comparative permeability measurements between the expressed proteins.

It was then transformed into X33, GS115, SMD1168H and KM71H strains of Pichia. PCR-screening for positive clones was performed, and estimation of multiple copy integrants in each Pichia strain was carried out using agar plates containing increasing concentrations of Zeocin((R)). The selected clones of multiple copy recombinant genes were then induced for TopoI expression in shaker flasks. GS115 and SMD1168 were found to be better Pichia strains to accommodate the recombinant gene for the expression of TopoI extracellularly. However, the DNA relaxation activity revealed that only the target enzyme in the culture supernatants of GS115-pPICZ-alpha-A-TopoI exhibited consistent enzyme activity over the cultivation time-points.

Microbial cell disruption is a major bottleneck in experimental throughput and is often restricted to large processing volumes. Moreover, for rigid yeast species, such as Pichia pastoris, no effective high-throughput disruption methods exist. The development of an automated, miniaturized, high-throughput, noncontact, scalable platform based on adaptive focused acoustics (AFA) to disrupt P. pastoris and recover intracellular heterologous protein is described. Augmented modes of AFA were established by investigating vessel designs and a novel enzymatic pretreatment step. Three different modes of AFA were studied and compared to the performance high-pressure homogenization. For each of these modes of cell disruption, response models were developed to account for five different performance criteria. Using multiple responses not only demonstrated that different operating parameters are required for different response optima, with highest product purity requiring suboptimal values for other criteria, but also allowed for AFA-based methods to mimic large-scale homogenization processes. These results demonstrate that AFA-mediated cell disruption can be used for a wide range of applications including buffer development, strain selection, fermentation process development, and whole bioprocess integration.

Triphenylmethane dyes are synthetic compounds widely used in diverse industries. Their removal from effluents is difficult, due to their high degree of structural complexity; hence, their high concentration in effluents cause a negative impact on the environment. In the present work, molecular docking was used to evaluate interactions between rGlLCC1 or rPOXA 1B enzymes with Crystal Violet (CV) or Malachite Green (MG) dyes. In addition, removal tests of the two dyes were performed. Van der Waals interactions were obtained for only the CV dye for both GlLCC1 and POXA 1B enzymes. Nevertheless, in the GlLCC1 model, two pi-pi interactions were observed. For the MG dye only, Van der Waals interactions were obtained. Moreover, amino acid composition interacting in each model with each dye was similar. It is important to highlight that by molecular docking, none of the estimated ligand configurations generated hydrogen bonds. Thus, explaining the difficulty to degrade CV and MG. Regarding CV, maximum decolorization percentage was 23.6 +/- 1.0% using Ganoderma lucidum supernatant and 5.0 +/- 0.5% with Pleurotus ostreatus supernatant. When using recombinant laccase enzyme concentrates, decolorization percentages were 9.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.5 +/- 1.0% for rGlLCC1 and rPOXA 1B, respectively. On the other hand, for the MG dye, maximum decolorization percentages were 52.1 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2% using G. lucidum and P. ostreatus concentrates, respectively.

More than 500 proteins have been expressed in the organism at a variety of cultivation scales, from small shake flasks to large bioreactors. Large-scale fermentation strategies typically employ chemically defined growth medium because of its greater batch-to-batch consistency and in many cases, lower costs compared to complex medium. For biopharmaceuticals, defined growth medium may also simplify downstream purification and regulatory documentation. Standard formulations of defined media for P. pastoris are minimal ones that lack the metabolic intermediates provided by complex components such as peptone and yeast extract. As a result, growth rates and per-cell productivities are significantly lower than in complex medium. We have designed a rich defined medium (RDM) for Pichia pastoris by systematically evaluating nutrients of increasing complexity and identifying those that are most critical for growth. We have also employed transcriptomics to gain deeper insights into the underlying metabolic processes and inform our media design. We have demonstrated that using RDM for expression of three heterologous proteins yields titers comparable to, or higher than, those in standard complex medium. RDM improves productivity of P. pastoris fermentations and its development demonstrates the usefulness of transcriptomics to accelerate process development for new molecules.</p></details></div>

We previously isolated the cDNA that codes for a laccase isozyme (Lac2a) from the medicinal mushroom Agaricus brasiliensis (Matsumoto-Akanuma et al., Int. J. Med. Mushrooms, 16, 375-393, 2014). In this study, we first attempted heterologous expression of the wild-type laccase using a Pichia pastoris secretory expression system. However, the trial was unsuccessful most likely because the enzyme was too unstable and degraded immediately after production. Therefore, we improved the stability of the laccase by using a phylogeny-based design method. We created a mutant laccase in which sixteen original residues were replaced with those found in the phylogenetically inferred ancestral sequence. The resulting mutant protein was successfully produced using the P. pastoris secretory expression system and then purified. The designed laccase showed catalytic properties similar to those of other fungal laccases. Moreover, the laccase is highly thermally stable at acidic and neutral pH and is also stable at alkaline pH at moderate temperatures. We expect that the laccase will serve as a useful tool for enzymatic polymerization of di-phenolic compounds.</p></details></div>

In the present study, Pichia pastoris was used as a host for the heterologous expression of a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum GH45 endoglucanase, Endo2. The recombinant plasmid pPICZalphaA was used to transform Pichia pastoris. Pichia culture supernatants expressing the recombinant Endo2 (rEndo2) were used for the purification and biochemical characterization of this enzyme. Therefore, rEndo2 was purified 6.7 fold to homogeneity with 34% yield and gave 19U/mg specific activity. It also showed maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 60 degrees C (against pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C for the native enzyme) and was thermostable at relatively high temperatures. Furthermore, rEndo2 retained its activity in a wide pH range (from 5 to 8). Besides, the recombinant endoglucanase was produced as an active 47kDa enzyme. This molecular weight differs from the one of the native enzyme (34kDa), which suggested a potential glycosylation of the recombinant enzyme. Moreover, rEndo2 was able to produce fermentable sugars after enzymatic assay on various cellulosic substrates with an interesting yield.

However, despite of their high economic values, the low yield and the cumbersome extraction process in AMPs production are problems that limit their industrial application and scientific research. To conquer these obstacles, optimized heterologous expression technologies were developed that could provide effective ways to increase the yield of AMPs.

Finally, three variant-encoding genes, Aoxyn11A (G21I), Aoxyn11A (Y13F) and Aoxyn11A (G21I-Y13F), were constructed by two-stage whole-plasmid PCR method, and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, respectively. The temperature optimum (T opt) of recombinant (re) AoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) was 60 degrees C, being 5 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11A(G21I) or reAoXyn11A(Y13F), and 10 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11A. The thermal inactivation half-life (t 1/2) of reAoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) at 50 degrees C was 240 min, being 40-, 3.4- and 2.5-fold longer than those of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11A(G21I) and reAoXyn11A(Y13F). The melting temperature (T m) values of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11A(G21I), reAoXyn11A(Y13F) and reAoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) were 52.3, 56.5, 58.6 and 61.3 degrees C, respectively. These findings indicated that the iterative mutagenesis of both Gly21Ile and Tyr13Phe improved the temperature characteristics of AoXyn11A in a synergistic mode. Besides those, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of reAoXyn11A(G21I-Y13F) was 473.1 mL mg(-1) s(-1), which was 1.65-fold higher than that of reAoXyn11A.</p></details></div>

Protein recovery represents a major part of the production costs. Pichia pastoris is one of the microbial systems most used for the production of heterologous proteins. The use of a cold-induced promoter to express lytic enzymes in the yeast after the growth stage could reduce protein recovery costs. This study shows that a cold-shock can be applied to induce lysis of the yeast cells. A strain of P. pastoris was constructed in which the endogenous eng gene encoding a putative endo-beta-1,3-glucanase was overexpressed using the cold-shock induced promoter of the cctalpha gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the transgenic P. pastoris, the expression of eng increased 3.6-fold after chilling the cells from 30 to 4 degrees C (cold-shock stage) followed by incubation for 6 h (eng expression stage). The culture was heated to 30 degrees C for 6 h (ENG synthesis stage) and kept at 37 degrees C for 24 h (lysis stage). After this procedure the cell morphology changed, spheroplasts were obtained and cellular lysis was observed. Thus, a clone of P. pastoris was obtained, which undergoes autolysis after a cold-shock.</p></details></div>

One of the prerequisites for the industrial application of laccases is their sufficient availability. However, expression levels of recombinantly expressed laccases are often low. In this study Mrl2, a new laccase from the basidiomycete Moniliophthora roreri, was cloned in Pichia pastoris and produced in an optimized fed-batch process at an exceptionally high yield of 1.05 g l(-1). With a redox potential of 0.58 V, Mrl2 belongs to mid-redox potential laccases. However, Mrl2 demonstrated high kcat values of 316, 20, 74, and 36 s(-1) towards 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), syringaldazine (SGZ), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP) and guaiacol, respectively. Mrl2 remained stable above pH 6 and in the presence of many metal ions, which is important for application in bioremediation. Mrl2 was investigated for the ability to degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSDAIs) at neutral pH value. The enzyme accepted and converted estrone, 17beta-estradiol, estriol, the synthetic contraceptive 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and bisphenol A at pH 7 faster than high-potential laccases from Trametes versicolor. For example, within 30 min Mrl2 removed more than 90% bisphenol A, 17ss-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol and estriol, respectively. The concentration of the recalcitrant drug diclofenac dropped by 56% after 20 h incubation with Mrl2.</p></details></div>

Compared to mammalian cultures, expression in P. pastoris is cheaper and faster, potentially leading to decreased costs and process development times. Product yields depend on a number of factors including the secretion signal chosen for expression, which can influence the host cell response to recombinant protein production. VRC01, a broadly neutralising anti-HIV antibody, was expressed in P. pastoris, using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter for both the heavy and light chains. Titre reached up to 3.05 mug mL(-1) in small scale expression. VRC01 was expressed using both the alpha-mating factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the murine IgG1 signal peptide. Surprisingly, using the murine IgG1 signal peptide resulted in higher yield of antibody capable of binding gp140 antigen. Furthermore, we evaluated levels of secretory stress compared to the untransformed wild-type strain and show a reduced level of secretory stress in the murine IgG1 signal peptide strains versus those containing the alpha-MF signal peptide. As bottlenecks in the secretory pathway are often the limiting factor in protein secretion, reduced levels of secretory stress and the higher yield of functional antibody suggest the murine IgG1 signal peptide may lead to better protein folding and secretion. This work indicates the possibilities for utilising the murine IgG1 signal peptide for a range of antibodies, resulting in high yields and reduced cellular stress.</p></details></div>

Our objective was to identify NZ2114 derivatives with improved activity through substitution of His16 and His18 with residues Arginine and Lysine. Eight mutants were designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 via pPICZalphaA. Five of them exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus at low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.057-0.454 muM. Among them, H1, H2, and H3 showed ideal pharmacodynamic effects on methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300. The total protein level of H1, H2, and H3 reached 1.70, 1.77 and 1.54 g/l at 120 h of induction in the 5-l fermenter, respectively. They killed over 99.9% of pathogens within 1.5 h at 2x and 4x MIC. The post antibiotic effect of H1, H2 and H3 to S. aureus ATCC43300 was 2.94, 1.75 and 1.55 h at 2x MIC, which was similar with their original peptide NZ2114 (1.43 h) and vancomycin (1.72 h). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) indicated indifferent effects between H1, H2, H3 and vancomycin, ampicillin, rifampicin. Additionally, they had low hemolysis and high stability in different environments (temperature, pH, proteases, and saline ions). All results indicate that H1, H2, and H3 can be produced in large-scale and have potential as therapeutic drugs against MRSA.</p></details></div>
