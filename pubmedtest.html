This study cloned a new crustin from Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, which we designated as LvCrustinB, using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of LvCrustinB is 751 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 591 bp encoding a peptide of 196 amino acids that includes a putative signal sequence. LvCrustinB is a type II crustin that has a glycine-rich region and a single whey acidic protein domain (WAP) domain. The mRNA transcript of LvCrustinB was detected in all examined tissues and was found to be most abundantly expressed in the epithelium and muscle. The expression of LvCrustinB in hemocytes was significantly upregulated after L. vannamei was challenged with LPS, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). When LvCrustinB was knocked down with RNAi, the mortality rate of L. vannamei significantly increased after V. parahaemolyticus or WSSV infection. Recombinant LvCrustinB was produced using Pichia pastoris GS115 and was shown to bind to two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and V. parahaemolyticus) via polysaccharides, which included PGN, LTA, and LPS. In vivo, the recombinant LvCrustinB remarkably protected L. vannamei from V. parahaemolyticus infection. These results suggest that LvCrustinB plays an important role in innate immunity and may be potentially utilized as antibacterial agents in shrimp.</p></details></div>

H2O2 is a signaling molecule that partakes in immune responses where its transport is mediated by aquaporins. To shed further light on the molecular basis of the aquaporin function in H2O2 transport, we have characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana aquaporin, AtPIP2;4, recombinantly produced to high yields in Pichia pastoris. Here, we present a newly established assay that allows detection of H2O2 transport by purified aquaporins reconstituted into liposomes, enabling us to compare aquaporin homologues with respect to substrate specificity. To get additional insight into the structural determinants for aquaporin-mediated H2O2 transport, we solved the 3D-structure of AtPIP2;4 to 3.7A resolution and found structural identity to the water channel from spinach (SoPIP2;1), with the difference that Cd(2+) cation is not required to retain the closed conformation. The transport specificities of the two plant aquaporins were compared to a human homologue, AQP1. Overall, we conclude that AtPIP2;4, SoPIP2;1 and hAQP1 are all transporters of both H2O and H2O2, but have different efficiencies for various specificities. Notably, all three homologues expedite H2O transport equally well while the plant aquaporins are more permeable to H2O2 than hAQP1. Comparison of the structures indicates that the observed variations in H2O and H2O2 transport cannot be explained by differences in the monomeric pore. Possibly, the determinants for transport specificities reside in the flexible domains outside the membrane core of these channels.</p></details></div>

They occur in every kingdom of life and catalyze a variety of essential reactions. Their production is of utmost interest regarding biotransformation and structure-function elucidation. However, they have proven hard to express due to their membrane anchor, their complex co-factor requirements as well as their need for a redox-partner. In our study, we investigated and compared different yeast strains for the production of the plant cytochrome P450 chalcone 3-hydroxylase. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating different yeasts for the expression of this abundant and highly significant protein superfamily. Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as three different strains of Pichia pastoris expressing chalcone 3-hydroxylase were cultivated in controlled bioreactor runs and evaluated regarding physiological parameters as well as expression levels of the cytochrome P450. Production differed significantly between the different strains and was found highest in the investigated P. pastoris MutS strain KM71H where 8 mg P450 per gram dry cell weight were detected. We believe that this host could be suitable for the expression of many eukaryotic, especially plant-derived, cytochrome P450s as it combines high specific product yields together with straightforward cultivation techniques for achieving high biomass concentrations. Both factors greatly facilitate subsequent establishment of purification procedures for the cytochrome P450 and make the yeast strain an ideal platform for biotransformation as well.</p></details></div>

A catalytic triad (Ser(217)-Glu(354)-His(463)) was found by constructing the three-dimensional structure of the lipase. In shake flasks, the lipase (LIP) catalytic activity in the supernatant of the recombinant Pichia pastoris increased 48.7% by codon optimization. LIP purified by anion exchange column showed a single protein band on 12% SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight (MW) of LIP was approximately 62 kDa. The specific activity of purified LIP reached 1257.9 U/mg. The optimum temperature and pH of LIP catalysis were 45 degrees C and pH 8.2, respectively. LIP was stable over the pH range of 4.2-11.2. LIP maintained its activity constantly at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C for 120 min. Zn(2+) inhibited LIP activity; Ba(2+), Mn(2+), Ca(2+) and EDTA increased the enzyme activity.

The molecular mass of RmAmyA was determined to be 49.9kDa via SDS-PAGE. RmAmyA was optimally active at 75 degrees C and pH6.0, and it did not require Ca(2+) to improve its activity. It exhibited broad substrate specificity towards amylose, amylopectin, soluble starch, pullulan, and cyclodextrins. High level of maltose (54%, w/w) was produced after liquefied starch was hydrolysed with RmAmyA for 16h. Moreover, the addition of RmAmyA into Chinese steamed bread resulted in 7.7% increment in the specific volume, and 17.2% and 11.5% reduction in the chewiness and hardness, respectively.

In this study, a recombinant equi merozoite antigen-2 (rEMA-2) of T. equi was used as an immunogen. Two groups of 10 mice each were divided into control and vaccinated groups. Sixty mares seronegative for theileriosis were divided in two groups, one vaccinated and another group as a control animal. Mice and mares of the vaccinated groups were inoculated with 150muL of the vaccine containing 50mug of rEMA-2 and 2mL of the vaccine containing 200mug of rEMA-2, respectively, at days 0 and 21. The immunogenicity of rEMA-2 was evaluated by ELISA and fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) using serum from vaccinated mice, mares and antigenicity in naturally infected horse. At every point throughout the ELISA study, there were significant differences between the vaccinated and control groups (p<0.05). The vaccine induced 3- and 4-fold IgG increases in mice at the 14th and 28th day, respectively, compared to the control group. The horses' IgG dynamics showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in the total IgG titer as early as day 7, which increased until day 28at which time a more significant (p<0.001) IgG titer was observed. In evaluating the isotypes, we observed a trend similar to that of total IgG, where IgG(T) (IgG3-5) were significantly (p<0.05) more elevated than the other isotypes analyzed, followed by IgGb (IgG4-7) and IgGa (IgG1). Positive fluorescence was detected by IFAT, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and conserves some epitopes identical to the native T. equi antigens present in the equine blood smear. Thus, our results suggest that rEMA-2 can be a promising vaccinal antigen.</p></details></div>

Vaccination is currently considered the best strategy to prevent R. anatipestifer infection in ducklings. In this study, we fused the duck IgY Fc gene to the outer membrane protein A (ompA) of R. anatipestifer. The eukaryotic expression plasmid carrying the fusion gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) to express the recombinant ompA and ompA-Fc proteins. Then, the effects of fused Fc on the vitality and antigen processing efficiency of duck peritoneal macrophages (PMo) were evaluated in vitro, whereas their immunogenicity was evaluated in vivo. Furthermore, Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (SCP) was used to evaluate its immune-conditioning effects on the activation of PMo. SCP was also used as adjuvant to investigate immunomodulation on immunoresponses induced by the fused ompA-Fc in ducklings. The conventional Freund's incomplete adjuvant served as the control of SCP. Notably, ompA-Fc promoted phagocytosis of PMo and significantly increased serum antibody titers, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte transformation rate, and serum levels of IL-2 and IL-4. In addition, ducklings injected with the ompA-Fc vaccine exhibited considerably greater resistance to the R. anatipestifer challenge than those that received vaccines based on standalone ompA. Of note, SCP was demonstrated to boost the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-beta by duck macrophages. In addition, the supplementation of SCP adjuvant to the ompA-Fc vaccines led to the further enhancement of immune response and vaccine protection. The dose of 200mug/mL showed the most pronounced effects. This study provided valuable insights into protective strategies against R. anatipestifer infection.</p></details></div>

Cells are able to adhere, grow and remodel scaffolds based on these materials. Usually, collagen and gelatin are sourced from animal material, risking pathogenic transmission and inconsistent batch-to-batch product quality. A recombinant production in yeast circumvents these disadvantages by ensuring production with a reproducible quality in animal-component-free media. A gelatin mimetic protein, based on the alpha chain of human collagen I, was cloned in Pichia pastoris under the control of the methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. A producing clone was selected and cultivated at the 30 L scale. The protein was secreted into the cultivation medium and the final yield was 3.4 g.L(-1). Purification of the target was performed directly from the cell-free medium by size exclusion chromatography. The gelatin mimetic protein was tested in cell culture for biocompatibility and for promoting cell adhesion. It supported cell growth and its performance was indistinguishable from animal-derived gelatin. The gelatin-mimetic protein represents a swift strategy to produce recombinant and human-based extracellular matrix proteins for various biomedical applications.</p></details></div>

EGB and successfully expressed in the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris. The mature protein without the initial 26 residues of signal peptide, designated LamC27, was found to be composed of fascin-like module and laminarinase-like catalytic module. The purified recombinant enzyme (rLamC27) with a calculated molecular mass of 45.3kDa displays activities toward a broad range of beta-linked polysaccharides, including laminarin, curdlan, pachyman, lichenan, and CMC. Enzymological characterization showed that rLamC27 performes its optimal activity under the condition of 45 degrees C and pH 7.0, respectively, and preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucans with a beta-1,3-linkage, which is similar to the LamC previously expressed in E. coli. TherLamC27 enzyme was activated by Mn(2+) and Ba(2+), while it was inhibited by Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Co(2+). Moreover, rLamC27 was strongly inhibited by 10mM EDTA with 7.5% of its original activity remiaining, and weakly by SDS and Triton X-100. In antifungal assay, rLamC27 was conformed to possess lytic and antifungal activity against rice blast fungus. Specifically, a significant decrease germ tube and appressorium formation ratios from 94% to 59% and 97%-51%, respectively, were observed following exposure to rLamC27. H2DCFDA and CFW staining further demonstrated that the fungistasis capability of rLamC27 could be contributed by its ability to hydrolyze components of the cell wall.

We have determined that pterostilbene, the most important phytoalexin, effectively inhibits the activity of G. citri-aurantii. To study the synthesis mechanism of pterostilbene against G. citri-aurantii in grape, we initially detected the content of pterostilbene present in grapes infected by G. citri-aurantii with the use of UHPLC-QQQ-MS(2) . Pterostilbene levels are controlled by the resveratrol O-methyltransferase (ROMT) gene, and within grape samples is positively related to the accumulation of resveratrol. The pPIC9k-ROMT vector and plasmid pCAMBIA2300-GFP-ROMT were constructed for expression purposes. The pPIC9k-ROMT vector was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and plasmid pCAMBIA2300-GFP-ROMT was expressed in onion. Analysis of qRT-PCR amplification samples revealed that gene expression was induced rapidly in grape as a defense against G. citri-aurantii. Western blot analysis verified that the recombinant protein was successfully expressed.</p><p><strong> PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:</strong> Pterostilbene is a trace and efficient phytoalexins produced by plant' secondary metabolism, which exhibits good pharmacological activity. As an important protective agent in plants, it can improve the antioxidant capacity and resistance to adversity of plants. However, the method which could be used for mass production of pterostilbene has not been reported currently. The key gene of pterostilbene biosynthesis was investigated and verified in this paper, which provides the theoretical basis for the industrial production of pterostilbene. The study of pterostilbene is significant for the prevention and treatment of G. citri-aurantii disease, and has important practical applications for the development and production of pesticides.</p></details></div>

Following screening of several commercially available metal oxide-based enrichment materials, all steps of the enrichment process (loading, washing and elution) were optimized for both the selective enrichment of 12 phosphorylated compounds from the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, and the simultaneous removal of highly abundant matrix components such as organic acids and sugars. The full analytical workflow was then validated to meet the demands of accurate quantification of phosphorylated metabolites in yeast (Pichia pastoris) cell extracts using the best performing material and cleanup/enrichment method combined with quantification strategies based on internal standardization with isotopically labeled internal standards and external calibration. A good recovery (>70%) for 5 of the 12 targeted phosphorylated compounds with RSDs of less than 6.0% was obtained while many sugars, organic acids and amino acids were removed (>99% of glucose, and >95% of aspartate, succinate, glutamate, alanine, glycine, serine, threonine, proline, and valine). The use of isotopically labeled internal standards added to the samples prior to SPE, enables accurate quantification of the metabolites as it compensates for errors introduced during sample pretreatment and GC-MS or LC-MS analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an effective and selective metal oxide-based affinity chromatography cleanup/enrichment method was designed and applied successfully for intracellular phosphorylated metabolites.</p></details></div>

We have previously used LC-MS/MS to identify proteins that are present in saliva of unfed Amblyomma americanum ticks that were exposed to different hosts. Here we show that A. americanum serine protease inhibitor (serpin) 27 (AAS27) is an immunogenic saliva protein that is injected into the host within the first day of tick feeding and is an anti-inflammatory protein that might act by blocking plasmin and trypsin functions. Although AAS27 is injected into the host throughout tick feeding, qRT-PCR and western blotting analyses indicate that the respective transcript and protein are present in high amounts within the first 24 h of tick feeding. Biochemical screening of Pichia pastoris-expressed recombinant (r) AAS27 against mammalian proteases related to host defense shows it is an inhibitor of trypsin and plasmin, with stoichiometry of inhibition indices of 3.5 and 3.8, respectively. Consistent with typical inhibitory serpins, rAAS27 formed heat- and SDS-stable irreversible complexes with both proteases. We further demonstrate that rAAS27 inhibits trypsin with ka of 6.46 +/- 1.24 x 104 M-1 s-1, comparable to serpins of other tick species. We show that native AAS27 is part of the repertoire of proteins responsible for the inhibitory activity against trypsin in crude tick saliva. AAS27 is likely utilized by the tick to evade the hosts inflammation defense since rAAS27 blocks both formalin and compound 48/80-induced inflammation in rats. Tick immune sera of rabbits that had acquired resistance against tick feeding following repeated infestations with A. americanum or Ixodes scapularis ticks reacts with rAAS27. Of significant interest, antibody to rAAS27 blocks this serpin inhibitory functions. Taken together, we conclude that AAS27 is an anti-inflammatory protein secreted into the host during feeding and may represent a potential candidate for development of an anti-tick vaccine.</p></details></div>

IFNalpha2b belongs to the type I interferon class with a major therapeutic application for the treatment of hepatitis B and C infections. A recombinant form of IFNalpha2b expressed in E. coli, known as IntronA, has been approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). IFN gamma, also known as type II interferon, plays a significant role in the inhibition of viral replication. Actimmune((R)) is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved version of IFN gamma for the indication of reducing infections associated with chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis. In this study we have applied advanced analytical methods for the characterization of IFNalpha2b and IFN gamma produced from Pichia pastoris. The multi-enzyme digestion approach has been developed to allow measurement of 100% sequence coverage and detailed analysis of post-translational variants and degradation products. In this manner, we identified the following variants in IFN alpha2b: N-terminal residual leader sequence, an amino acid substitution, oxidation of methionine residues and two sites of high mannose N-glycosylation. In the Pichia IFN gamma produced material, our approach detected variants resulting from glycosylation, C-terminal proteolysis, oxidation of methionine residues and deamidation. In this manner, the analytical program was able to support rapid process development as well as identify product variants and degradation products in the resulting product.</p></details></div>

Komagataella phaffii) is a widely used generally recognized as safe host for heterologous expression of proteins in both industry and academia. Recently, it has been shown to be a potentially good chassis host for the production of high-value pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Nevertheless, limited availability of selective markers and low efficiency of homologous recombination make this process difficult and time-consuming, particularly in the case of multistep biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an efficient and marker-free multiloci gene knock-in method in P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A non-homologous-end-joining defective strain (Deltaku70) was first constructed using the CRISPR-Cas9 based gene deficiency approach. It was then used as a parent strain for multiloci gene integration. Ten guide RNA (gRNA) targets were designed within 100 bp upstream of the promoters or downstream of terminator, and then tested using an eGFP reporter and confirmed as suitable single-locus integration sites. Three high-efficiency gRNA targets (PAOX1UP-g2, PTEF1UP-g1, and PFLD1UP-g1) were selected for double- and triple-locus co-integration. The integration efficiency ranged from 57.7 to 70% and 12.5 to 32.1% for double-locus and triple-locus integration, respectively. In addition, biosynthetic pathways of 6-methylsalicylic acid and 3-methylcatechol were successfully assembled using the developed method by one-step integration of functional genes. The desired products were obtained, which further established the effectiveness and applicability of the developed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene co-integration method in P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> A CRISPR-Cas9-mediated multiloci gene integration method was developed with efficient gRNA targets in P. pastoris. Using this method, multiple gene cassettes can be simultaneously integrated into the genome without employing selective markers. The multiloci integration strategy is beneficial for pathway assembly of complicated pharmaceuticals and chemicals expressed in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

CalB has been produced by heterologous expression using Pichia pastoris under PGK constitutive promoter (named LipB). Here, we have studied the structural features of commercial CalB and LipB enzymes using circular dichroism and fluorescence under different conditions. In the presence of denaturing agents CalB was more stable than LipB, in contrast, at increasing temperatures, LipB was more thermostable than CalB. Mass spectrometry data indicates that both enzymes have an insertion of amino acids related to alpha-factor yeast signal, however LipB enzyme showed the addition of nine residues at the N-terminal while CalB showed only four residues. Molecular modeling of LipB showed the formation of an amphipathic alpha-helix in N-terminal region that was not observed in CalB. This data suggests that this new alpha-helix possess could be involved in LipB thermostability. These results associated with new structural studies may provide information to the design of novel biocatalysts.</p></details></div>

The loop flanking the product binding site plays the role of a flexible "arm" extending toward cellobiose, and residue Thr389 of this loop acts as a "claw" that captures cellobiose. Five mutations of residue Thr389 were considered to enhance the loop-cellobiose interaction. The lysine mutant was found to significantly accelerate cellobiose expulsion and facilitate polysaccharide-chain translocation. Lysine mutation of Thr393 in Talaromyces emersonii CBHI (TeCel7A) performed similarly. Lysine approaches the catalytic area and stabilizes the Michaelis complex, potentially affecting glycosylation, the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle. QM/MM calculations indicate that lysine replacement diminishes the barrier against proton transfer, the crucial step of glycosylation, by 2.3 kcal/mol. Experimental validation was performed using the full-length wild-type (WT) of TeCel7A and its mutants, recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris, to degrade the substrates. Compared with the WT, the lysine mutant revealed an associated higher enzymatic reaction rate. Furthermore, cellobiose yield was also increased by lysine mutation, indicating that dissociation of the enzyme from cellulose was accelerated, which largely stems from the enhanced flexibility of the "arm". The present work is envisioned to help design strategies for improving enzymatic activity, while decreasing enzyme cost.</p></details></div>

GH51 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases are important in biomass pretreatment because they act synergistically with other enzymes during hemicellulose hydrolysis.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A GH51 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and characterized. The recombinant alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, TlAbf51, showed an optimum temperature and pH of 55-60 degrees C and 3.5-4.0, respectively, and remained stable at 50 degrees C and pH 3.0-9.0. TlAbf51 showed a higher catalytic efficiency (5712 mM(-1) s(-1)) than most fungal alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases towards the substrate 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside.

The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii (K. phaffii) is an attractive alternative to Escherichia coli (E. coli) for whole cell biocatalysis due to its genetic tractability and capacity to grow to up to 60% wet cell weight by volume. We sought to exploit high cell density K. phaffii to intensify whole-cell chiral amino-alcohol (CAA) biosynthesis. We engineered two novel K. phaffii GS115 strains: one by inserting a Chromobacterium violaceum omega-transaminase CV2025 transgene, for strain PpTAmCV708, and a second strain, PpTAm-TK16, by also inserting the same CV2025 transgene plus a second transgene for a native transketolase. At high cell density, both strains tolerated high substrate concentrations. When fed three low cost substrates, 200 mM glycolaldehyde, 200 mM hydroxypyruvate and 150 mM methylbenzylamine, PpTAm-TK16 whole cells achieved 0.29 g L(-1) h(-1) space-time yield of the acetophenone by-product, a 49-fold increase of the highest levels reported for E. coli whole cells harbouring the equivalent pathway. When fed only the low-cost substrate, 150 mM methylbenzylamine, strain PpTAmCV708 achieved a 105-fold increase of reported E. coli whole cell biocatalysis performance, with a space-time yield of 0.62 g L(-1) h(-1) of the CAA, 2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT). The rapid growth and high biomass characteristics of K. phaffii were successfully exploited for production of ABT by whole-cell biocatalysis at higher levels than the previously achieved with E. coli in the presence of the same substrates.

In parallel, we expressed the same sequence in two different hosts: Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Both productions were successful and led to a fair amount of VHHs. The integrity and conformation of the VHH were characterized by complementary mass spectrometry approaches, while surface plasmon resonance experiments were used to assess the VHH recognition capacity and affinity toward its "antigen." Using this combination of orthogonal techniques, it was possible to show that the three VHHs-whether synthetic or recombinant ones-were properly and similarly folded and recognized the "antigen" HER2 with similar affinities, in the nanomolar range.

Compared to standard methanol induction, sorbitol/methanol (1:1, C-mol/C-mol) mixed induction improved cellular viability from 92.8+/-0.3% to 97.7+/-0.1% although resulted in a reduced product yield from 1.65+/-0.03gL(-1) to 1.12+/-0.07gL(-1). On the other hand, average oxygen consumption rate (OUR) dropped from 241.4+/-21.3mmolL(-1)h(-1) to 145.5+/-6.7mmolL(-1)h(-1). Cell diameter decreased over time in the mixed induction, resulting in a D50 value of 3.14mum at harvest compared to 3.85mum with methanol. The reduction in cell size enhanced the maximum dewatering efficiency from 78.1+/-3.9% to 84.5+/-3.3% as evaluated by using an established ultra scale-down methodology that models pilot and industrial scale disc stack centrifugation. Seventy host cell proteins (HCPs) were identified in clarified supernatant when using sorbitol/methanol mixed induction regimen. The total number of HCPs identified with standard methanol induction was nearly one hundred. The downstream process advantage of the mixed induction lies in improved product purity by reducing both cell mortality and level of released whole cell proteins. This needs to be balanced and optimised against the observed reduction in product yield during fermentation.</p></details></div>

In this study, the production of hirudin variant 3 (HV3) was successfully realized by cultivating the recombinant Pichia pastoris GS115/pPIC9K-hv3 under the regulation of the promoter of AOX1 encoding alcohol oxidase (AOX). The antithrombin activity in the fermentation broth reached the maximum value of 5000 ATU/mL. To explore an effective strategy for improving HV3 production in the future, we investigated the influence of methanol assimilation on the general gene expression in this recombinant by transcriptomic study. The results showed that methanol was partially oxidized into CO2, and the rest was converted into glycerone-P which subsequently entered into central carbon metabolism, energy metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis. However, the later metabolic processes were almost all down-regulated. Therefore, we propose that the up-regulated central carbon metabolism, energy, and amino acid metabolism should be beneficial for methanol assimilation, which would accordingly improve the production of HV3.</p></details></div>

Another positive regulator, Mxr1p, did not have the same effect on the DAS1 promoter, while it was more effective than KpTrmp1 on the AOX1 promoter. Removing a potential upstream repression sequence (URS) and multiplying UAS1DAS1 in the DAS1 promoter significantly enhanced the yield of C. braakii phytase with methanol-feeding, which surpassed the native AOX1 promoter by 80%.

The enzyme was produced in two microorganisms that introduce glycosylation (M. thermophila and Pichia pastoris) and in Escherichia coli (non-glycosylated). Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of glycosylation and revealed differences in the lengths of glycan chains between the enzymes produced in M. thermophila and P. pastoris. The melting temperature and the optimal temperature for activity of the non-glycosylated enzyme were considerably lower than those of the glycosylated enzymes. The three MtFae1a versions also exhibited differences in specific activity and specificity. The catalytic efficiency of the glycosylated enzymes were more than 10 times higher than that of the non-glycosylated one. In biotechnology, immobilization is often used to allow reusing enzyme and was investigated on mesoporous silica particles. We found the binding kinetics and immobilization yield differed between the enzyme versions. The largest differences were observed when comparing enzymes with and without glycosylation, but significant variations were also observed between the two differently glycosylated enzymes.

Based on codon-optimized P1 and 3C genes, EV71-VLPs were efficiently expressed in Pichia pastoris system, and the expression level reached 270 mg/L. Biochemical and biophysical analyses showed that the produced EV71-VLPs consisted of processed VP0, VP1, and VP3 present as ~35nm spherical particles. The immune response as a function of EV71-VLPs and adjuvant dose ratio was investigated for vaccine development. Immunization with EV71-VLPs of 1-5 microg/dose and adjuvant of 225 microg/dose induced robust neutralizing antibody responses in mice and provided effective protection against lethal challenge in both maternally transferred antibody and passive transfer protection mouse models.

To avoid a carbon starvation step, fermentation was conducted using combinations of sorbitol with glycerol and methanol in the cell growth and induction phases, respectively. The cutinase productivity (27.71 U mL(-1) h(-1)) was 9.93 U mL(-1) h(-1) greater than that achieved using traditional two-phase methods, and a cutinase activity of 2660 U mL(-1), using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as substrate, was achieved after only 96 h in a 3-L bioreactor. Subsequently, the combination of HiC with Thermobifida fusca cutinase (TfC) in cotton fabric bioscouring was evaluated by monitoring the wettability and dyeability of the fabric. Treatment with 20 U mL(-1) of HiC at 80 degrees C for 5 min followed by 30 U mL(-1) of TfC at 50 degrees C for 1 h gave the best results. The total treatment time was shorter and performance was better than those seen with the alkali method.</p></details></div>

While these systems offer sophisticated capabilities to screen batch processes, they lack the ability to realize fed-batch processes, which are used more frequently in industrial bioprocessing. In this study, a novel approach to realize a feedback-regulated enzyme-based slow-release system (FeedER), allowing exponential fed-batch for microscale cultivations, was realized by extending our existing Mini Pilot Plant technology with a customized process control system. By continuously comparing the experimental growth rates with predefined set points, the automated dosage of Amyloglucosidase enzyme for the cleavage of dextrin polymers into D-glucose monomers is triggered. As a prerequisite for stable fed-batch operation, a constant pH is maintained by automated addition of ammonium hydroxide. We show the successful application of FeedER to study fed-batch growth of different industrial model organisms including Corynebacterium glutamicum, Pichia pastoris, and Escherichia coli. Moreover, the comparative analysis of a C. glutamicum GFP producer strain, cultivated under microscale batch and fed-batch conditions, revealed two times higher product yields under slow growing fed-batch operation. In summary, FeedER enables to run 48 parallel fed-batch experiments in an automated and miniaturized manner, and thereby accelerates industrial bioprocess development at the screening stage.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a recombinant F. gigantica cathepsin B (rFgCatB) protein was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Western blot analysis confirmed the reactivity of the purified rFgCatB protein to serum from F. gigantica-infected goats. The effects of serial concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mug/ml) of rFgCatB on various functions of goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were examined. We demonstrated that rFgCatB protein can specifically bind to the surface of PBMCs. In addition, rFgCatB increased the expression of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, TGF-beta, and IFN-gamma), and increased nitric oxide production and cell apoptosis, but reduced cell viability. These data show that rFgCatB can influence cellular and immunological functions of goat PBMCs. Further characterization of the posttranslational modification and assessment of rFgCatB in immunogenicity studies is warranted.</p></details></div>

However, no vaccine is currently available to prevent ZIKV infection. Here, we report the development of a yeast-derived subunit protein vaccine for ZIKV. The envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV was produced as a secretory protein in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The yeast-derived EDIII could inhibit ZIKV infection in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it had acquired an appropriate conformation to bind to cellular receptors of ZIKV. Immunization with recombinant EDIII protein effectively induced antigen-specific binding antibodies and cellular immune responses. The resulting anti-EDIII sera could efficiently neutralize ZIKV representative strains from both Asian and African lineages. Passive transfer with the anti-EDIII neutralizing sera could confer protection against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice. Importantly, we found that purified anti-EDIII antibodies did not cross-react with closely related dengue virus (DENV) and therefore did not enhance DENV infection. Collectively, our results demonstrate that yeast-produced EDIII is a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine candidate.</p></details></div>

Microscopic evidence in support of such a reversible nature of stacking, in the form of 'TGN peeling,' has been reported in various species, suggesting a potential evolutionarily conserved mechanism. However, knowledge of such mechanism has remained sketchy. Here, we have explored this issue in the budding yeast Pichia pastoris which harbors stacked Golgi. We observed that deletion of GRIP domain golgin P. pastoris (Pp)IMH1 increases the peeling of late cisterna, causing unstacking of the Golgi stack. Our results suggest that the PpImh1 dimer mediates reversible stacking through a continuous association-dissociation cycle of its GRIP domain to the middle and late Golgi cisterna under the GTP hydrolysis-based regulation of Arl3-Arl1 GTPase cascade switch. The reversible cisternal stacking function of PpImh1 is independent of its vesicle-capturing function. Since GRIP domain proteins are conserved in plants, animals and fungi, it is plausible that this reversible mechanism of Golgi stacking is evolutionarily conserved.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.</p></details></div>

Fructan degradation is catalyzed by fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), which are structurally related to cell wall invertases (CWI). However, the biological function(s) of FEH enzymes in non-fructan species have remained largely enigmatic. In the present study, one maize CWI-related enzyme named Zm-6&1-FEH1, displaying FEH activity, was explored with respect to its substrate specificities, its expression during plant development, and its possible interaction with CWI inhibitor protein. Following heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and in N. benthamiana leaves, recombinant Zm-6&1-FEH1 revealed substrate specificities of levan and inulin, and also displayed partially invertase activity. Expression of Zm-6&1-FEH1 as monitored by qPCR was strongly dependent on plant development and was further modulated by abiotic stress. To explore whether maize FEH can interact with invertase inhibitor protein, Zm-6&1-FEH1 and maize invertase inhibitor Zm-INVINH1 were co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis and in vitro enzyme inhibition assays indicated productive complex formation. In summary, the results provide support to the hypothesis that in non-fructan species FEH enzymes may modulate the regulation of CWIs.</p></details></div>

The structures of the diverse cell wall matrix polysaccharides influence commercially important properties of plant cells, including growth, biomass recalcitrance, organ abscission, and the shelf life of fruits. This review is a comprehensive summary of the matrix polysaccharide glycosyltransferase (GT) activities that have been verified using in vitro assays following heterologous GT protein expression. Plant cell wall (PCW) biosynthetic GTs are primarily integral transmembrane proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi of the plant secretory system. The low abundance of these enzymes in plant tissues makes them particularly difficult to purify from native plant membranes in quantities sufficient for enzymatic characterization, which is essential to study the functions of the different GTs. Numerous activities in the synthesis of the major cell wall matrix glycans, including pectins, xylans, xyloglucan, mannans, mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs), and arabinogalactan components of AGP proteoglycans have been mapped to specific genes and multi-gene families. Cell wall GTs include those that synthesize the polymer backbones, those that elongate side branches with extended glycosyl chains, and those that add single monosaccharide linkages onto polysaccharide backbones and/or side branches. Three main strategies have been used to identify genes encoding GTs that synthesize cell wall linkages: analysis of membrane fractions enriched for cell wall biosynthetic activities, mutational genetics approaches investigating cell wall compositional phenotypes, and omics-directed identification of putative GTs from sequenced plant genomes. Here we compare the heterologous expression systems used to produce, purify, and study the enzyme activities of PCW GTs, with an emphasis on the eukaryotic systems Nicotiana benthamiana, Pichia pastoris, and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We discuss the enzymatic properties of GTs including kinetic rates, the chain lengths of polysaccharide products, acceptor oligosaccharide preferences, elongation mechanisms for the synthesis of long-chain polymers, and the formation of GT complexes. Future directions in the study of matrix polysaccharide biosynthesis are proposed.</p></details></div>

The endoglucanase from Lentinula edodes (LeCel12A) was produced in Pichia pastoris and shown maximum activity at 40 degrees C and pH3.0. The LeCel12A exhibited preferential hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose. The activity of LeCel12A could be enhanced by MnCl2 in dose-dependent manners. Trp22 was a key amino acid affecting LeCel12A activity. The LeCel12A enhanced the hydrolysis of rape straw, rice straw, wheat straw, and corn straw. Supplemental LeCel12A increased lactic acid concentration and reduced lignocellulosic content of the rape straw silage. Though an increase in the saccharification efficiency of LeCel12A-treated rape straw silage was observed when the fibrolytic enzyme loading of hydrolysis system was enough, supplemental LeCel12A did not dramatically enhance the saccharification of rape straw silage in the current study. This study demonstrates that LeCel12A may be useful for improving the utilization of rape straw silage as an additive, but its supplemental dose, cost benefit, and consequent application possibility in biofuel production require careful consideration and further investigation.</p></details></div>

Although co-expression of MTG and its N-terminal pro-peptide can obtain the active MTG, the enzyme activity was still low. One of the basic steps for strain improvement is to ensure a sufficient level of transcription of the heterologous gene, based on promoter strength and gene copy number. To date, high-copy-number recombinants of P. pastoris are achievable only by cloning of gene concatemers, so methods for rapid and reliable multicopy strains are therefore desirable.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The coexpression strains harboring different copies mtg were obtained successfully by stepwise increasing Zeocin concentration based on the rDNA sequence of P. pastoris. The genome of coexpression strains with the highest enzyme activity was analyzed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, and three copies of mtg gene (mtg-3c) was calculated according to the standard curve of gap and mtg genes (gap is regarded as the single-copy reference gene). The maximum enzyme activity of mtg-3c was up to 1.41 U/mL after being inducted for 72 h in 1 L flask under optimal culture conditions, and two protein bands were observed at the expected molecular weights (40 kDa and 5 kDa) by Western blot. Furthermore, among the strains detected, compared with mtg-2c, mtg-6c or mtg-8c, mtg-3c is the highest expression level and enzyme activity, implying that mtg-3c is the most suitable for co-expression pro-peptide and MTG.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study provides an effective strategy for improving the expression level of active MTG by directional increasing of mtg copies in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

We hypothesized that latent interferon alpha 2b (IFNalpha2b) produced by fusion of Latency associated protein (LAP) domain of TGFbeta and IFNalpha2b having HCV NS3 protease cleavage site as linker that will be activated only at target site (liver) by viral protease (HCV NS3 protease) present on the surface of infected cells. The fusion proteins were expressed in pichia pastoris as homodimer and cleaved by recombinant HCV NS3 protease in vitro into two fragments corresponding to the IFNalpha-2b and LAP respectively. The latency of chimeric proteins and biological activity after treatment with HCV NS3 protease was assessed by cytopathic effect inhibition assay in A594 cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and reduction in HCV viral load in Huh7 cells. The HCV NS3 protease was present on the surface of HCV replicating Huh7 cells in amount that activated half of the effective concentration (EC50) of latent IFNalpha2b fusion protein. As free circulating HCV NS3 protease was not detected in sera from chronic HCV patients and in vitro cleavage of intact latent IFNalpha2b fusion protein was not observed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from chronic HCV patients, thus there are less likely chances of activation and off target binding of latent IFNalpha2b to show side effects during systemic route of administration. Therefore, most of the side effects of interferon can be overwhelmed at the cost of 50% reduced biological activity. Thus, the use of latent IFNalpha2b can be considered again as an option for treatment of HCV infection in combination with direct acting antivirals rather than alone with improved safety profile.</p></details></div>

The bgh12A and xgh12B genes were identified in the unsequenced genome of A. cervinus using primers designed for conservative regions of the corresponding subgroups and a genome walking approach. The recombinant enzymes were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris, purified, and characterized. Bgh12A was an endo-(1,4)-beta-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) hydrolyzing the unbranched soluble beta-(1,4)-glucans and mixed linkage beta-(1,3;1,4)-D-glucans. Bgh12A exhibited maximum activity on barley beta-glucan (BBG), which amounted to 614 +/- 30 U/mg of protein.

Recombinant P. pastoris strains produced up to 10(6) U/L of the target enzymes with at least 75% of recombinant protein in the total extracellular proteins. The Bgh12A and Xgh12B sequences show 43% identity. Strict differences in substrate specificity of Bgh12A and Xgh12B were in congruence with the presence of subgroup-specific structural loops and substrate-binding aromatic residues in the catalytic cleft of the enzymes. Individual composition of aromatic residues in the catalytic cleft defined variability in substrate selectivity within GH12 subgroups I and II.</p></details></div>

To further improve its ability to express heterologous proteins, we developed a high-throughput P. pastoris screening method based on droplet microfluidic and demonstrated the method by screening and obtaining mutants with enhanced xylanase expression and secretion abilities. We used PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification to obtain a fusion fragment of xylanase xyn5 gene and green fluorescent protein gfp gene, and cloned this fragment into pPIC9K, the expression vector of Pichia pastoris, to construct the plasmid pPIC9K-xyn5-gfp that recombined the DNA fragments of xylanase and green fluorescent protein. After this plasmid entered P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation, the P. pastoris SG strain that could express xylanase and green fluorescent protein was obtained. The above-said strains were then mutagenized by atmospheric room temperature plasma and subsequently encapsulated to form single-cell droplets. After 24-hour cultivation of the droplets, microfluidic screening was carried out to obtain the mutant strain with high xylanase expression for further construction and screening of the next mutagenesis library. After five rounds of droplet microfluidic screening, a highly productive strain P. pastoris SG-m5 was obtained. The activity of the expressed xylanase was 149.17 U/mg, 300% higher than that of those expressed by the original strain SG. This strain's ability to secrete heterologous protein was 160% higher than that of the original strain. With a screening throughput of 100 000 strains per hour, the high-throughput P. pastoris screening system based on single-cell droplet microfluidic developed by the present study screens a library with million strains in only 10 hours and consumes only 100 muL of fluorescent reagent, thus reducing the reagent cost by millions of times compared with the traditional microplate screening and more importantly, providing a novel method to obtain P. pastoris with high abilities to express and secret heterologous proteins by efficient and low-cost screening.</p></details></div>

CYP5150AN1 catalyzed the 2beta-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycortisol. It is interesting that they display different regioselectivity of hydroxylation from that of their isoenzyme, CYP5150AP2, which possesses 19- and 11beta-hydroxylase activities.IMPORTANCE The steroidal hydroxylases CYP5150AP3 and CYP5150AN1 together with the previously characterized CYP5150AP2 belong to the CYP5150A family of P450 enzymes with high amino acid sequence identity, but they showed completely different regioselectivities toward 11-deoxycortisol, suggesting the regioselectivity diversity of steroidal hydroxylases of CYP5150 family. They are also distinct from the known bacterial and fungal steroidal hydroxylases in substrate specificity and regioselectivity. Biocatalytic hydroxylation is one of the important transformations for the functionalization of steroid nucleus rings but remains a very challenging task in organic synthesis. These hydroxylases are useful additions to the toolbox of hydroxylase enzymes for the functionalization of steroids at various positions.</p></details></div>

The growing problem of drug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, together with the lack of new effective compounds, has stimulated interest in developing AMPs as anti-infective molecules. PAF102 is an AMP that was rationally designed for improved antifungal properties. This cell penetrating peptide has potent and specific activity against major fungal pathogens. Cecropin A is a natural AMP with strong and fast lytic activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens, including multidrug resistant pathogens. Both peptides, PAF102 and Cecropin A, are alternative antibiotic compounds. However, their exploitation requires fast, cost-efficient production systems. Here, we developed an innovative system to produce AMPs in Pichia pastoris using the oleosin fusion technology. Oleosins are plant-specific proteins with a structural role in lipid droplet formation and stabilization, which are used as carriers for recombinant proteins to lipid droplets in plant-based production systems. This study reports the efficient production of PAF102 in P. pastoris when fused to the rice plant Oleosin 18, whereas no accumulation of Cecropin A was detected. The Ole18-PAF102 fusion protein targets the lipid droplets of the heterologous system where it accumulates to high levels. Interestingly, the production of this fusion protein induces the formation of lipid droplets in yeast cells, which can be additionally enhanced by the coexpression of a diacylglycerol transferase gene that allows a three-fold increase in the production of the fusion protein. Using this high producer strain, PAF102 reaches commercially relevant yields of up to 180 mg/l of yeast culture. Moreover, the accumulation of PAF102 in the yeast lipid droplets facilitates its downstream extraction and recovery by flotation on density gradients, with the recovered PAF102 being biologically active against pathogenic fungi. Our results demonstrate that plant oleosin fusion technology can be transferred to the well-established P. pastoris cell factory to produce the PAF102 antifungal peptide, and potentially other AMPs, for multiple applications in crop protection, food preservation and animal and human therapies.</p></details></div>

To accomplish high-throughput production of various nanobodies, utilization of microbes is an attractive option. In the present study, various chimeric nanobodies were prepared using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. We designed chimeric nanobodies with complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) against green fluorescent protein (GFP) or cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) based on the scaffold of GFP-nanobody. FLAG-tagged chimeric nanobodies were prepared by one-step cloning and produced using P. pastoris. Secreted chimeric nanobodies were purified from the culture media of P. pastoris transformants. Relative binding abilities of purified chimeric nanobodies to GFP and CD4 was tested using a BIACORE T-200. P. pastoris successfully produced a high yield of FLAG-tagged chimeric nanobodies. FLAG-tagged GFP- and CD4-nanobodies were shown to specifically bind to GFP and CD4, respectively. Chimeric nanobodies, in which the CDR2 or 3 of GFP-nanobody was replaced with CDRs of CD4-nanobody, acquired the ability to bind to CD4 without binding to GFP. These results demonstrate successful production of functional chimeric nanobodies using P. pastoris. These results also suggest that swapping of CDRs, especially CDRs 2 or 3, potentially enables a novel method of creating nanobodies.</p></details></div>

Setosphaeria turcica produced three active laccase isozymes: Stlac1, Stlac2, and Stlac6. Stlac2 was heterologously expressed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems. The eukaryotic recombinant Stlac2 expressed in Pichia pastoris was inactive, and also showed a higher molecular weight than predicted because of glycosylation. The depression of laccase activity was attributable to the incorrect glycosylation at Asn97. Stlac2 expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant Stlac2 exhibited activity of 28.23U/mg with 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate.

According to the proline rule, the high fluctuation site S115 or V213 was replaced with proline residue, the two lipase mutants S115P and V213P were obtained. The mutant V213P exhibited evidently enhanced thermostability with an approximately 70% longer half-life at 50 degrees C than that of the parent LIP2 expressed in P. pastoris. The temperature optimum of V213P was 42 degrees C, which was about 5.0 degrees C higher than that of the parent LIP2, while its specific catalytic activity was comparable to that of the parent and reached 876.5U/mg. The improved thermostability of V213P together with its high catalytic efficiency indicated that the rational design strategy employed here can be efficiently applied for structure optimization of industrially important enzymes.</p></details></div>

Hence, suitable systems need to be developed to validate the sensor readings prior to their use in monitoring and control systems. This study presents a novel approach for online validation of sensor readings. The basic idea is to compare the original sensor reading with predictions for this sensor reading based on the remaining sensor network's information. Deviations between original and predicted sensor readings are used to indicate sensor faults. Since especially batch processes show varying lengths and different phases (e.g., lag and exponential phase), prediction models that are dependent on process time are necessary. The binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to select the best prediction models for each time step. A regularization approach is utilized to avoid overfitting. Models with high complexity and prediction errors are penalized, resulting in optimal predictions for the sensor reading at each time step (5% mean relative prediction error). The sensor reliability is calculated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of model-based predictions and the distribution of a moving window of original sensor readings (moving window size = 10 readings). The developed system allows for the online detection of sensor faults. This is especially important when sensor data are used as input to soft sensors for critical quality attributes or the process control system. The proof-of-concept is exemplarily shown for a turbidity sensor that is used to monitor a Pichia pastoris-batch process.</p></details></div>

The complete degradation of xylan requires the action of several enzymes, among them beta-xylosidase. The fungus Penicillium purpurogenum secretes a number of enzymes participating in the degradation of xylan. In this study, a beta-xylosidase from this fungus was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and characterized. This enzyme (Xyl2) is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 3; it consists of a sequence of 792 residues including a signal peptide of 20 residues, with a theoretical molecular mass for the mature protein of 84.2KDa and an isoelectric point of 5.07. The highest identity with a characterized fungal enzyme, is with a beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (70%). The optimal activity of Xyl2 is found at pH 2.0 and 28 degrees C. The enzyme is most stable at pH 2.0 and conserves 40% of activity at 42 degrees C (after 1h incubation). The kinetic parameters for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside are: KM 0.53 mM, kcat 1*10(7) s(-1) and kcat/KM 1.9*10(10)M(-1)s(-1). The enzyme is about 10% active on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside. Xyl2 exhibits a high hydrolytic activity on xylooligosaccharides; it liberates xylose from beechwood and birchwood glucuronoxylan and it acts synergistically with endoxylanases in the degradation of xylan. Its low pH optimum make this enzyme particularly useful in potential applications requiring a low pH such as increasing the flavor of wine.</p></details></div>

There was only one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of 151amino acid residues within the deduced amino acid sequence of CgCLec-3.

Despite being an efficient producer, we observed previously that certain recombinant proteins were mistargeted to the vacuole on their route to secretion. Simultaneous disruption of one vacuolar sorting pathway together with vacuolar proteases prevented this mis-sorting and resulted in higher levels of secreted heterologous protein. Inspired by the positive results, we now set out to investigate the influence of further parts of the vacuolar pathway, namely the Cvt-pathway and the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Strains impaired in the Cvt pathway (atg11, atg8) had no effect on secretion of the model protein carboxylesterase (CES), but resulted in lower secretion levels of the antibody fragment HyHEL-Fab. Disruption of genes involved in the HOPS complex led to vacuole-like compartments of the B category of vps mutants, which are characteristic for the deleted genes YPT7, VPS41 and VAM6. In particular ypt7 and vam6 strains showed an improvement in secreting the model proteins HyHEL-Fab and CES. Additional disruption of the vacuolar protease Pep4 and the potential protease Vps70 led to even further enhanced secretion in ypt7 and vam6 strains. Nevertheless, intracellular product accumulation was still observed. Therefore, the secretory route was strengthened by overexpression of early or late secretory genes in the vacuolar sorting mutants. Thereby, overexpression of Sbh1, a subunit of the ER translocation pore, significantly increased HyHEL-Fab secretion, leading up to fourfold higher extracellular Fab levels in the ypt7 strain. The beneficial impact on protein secretion and the suitability of these strains for industrial applicability was confirmed in fed-batch cultivations.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Disruption of genes involved in the HOPS complex, especially YPT7, has a great influence on the secretion of the two different model proteins HyHEL-Fab and CES. Therefore, disruption of HOPS genes shows a high potential to increase secretion of other recombinant proteins as well. Secretion of HyHEL-Fab was further enhanced when overexpressing secretion enhancing factors. As the positive effect was also present in fed-batch cultivations, these modifications likely have promising industrial relevance.</p></details></div>

A major source of variability is related to viral genotypes and subgenotypes. Their possible influence on diagnosis and prophylaxis is poorly known and has mostly been evaluated for genotypes A, B, C and D. Robust data showing the detection efficiency of HBsAg from genotype F is lacking. This study examined the effect of virus-like particles containing HBsAg from genotypes A and F (particularly, F1b and F4) produced in Pichia pastoris in relation to the anti-HBs antibodies used in the immunoassays for in vitro diagnosis and compared it with that exerted by the G145R S-escape mutant. The results showed that HBsAg detection rates for subgenotypes F1b and F4 differed significantly from those obtained for genotype A and that subgenotype F1b had a major impact on the sensitivity of the immunoassays tested. Prediction of the tertiary structure of subgenotypes F1b and F4 revealed changes inside and outside the major hydrophilic region (aa 101-160) of the HBsAg compared to genotype A and the G145R variant. A phosphorylation site (target for protein kinase C) produced by the G145R substitution might prevent recognition by anti-HBs antibodies. In conclusion, the use of different genotypes or variants for diagnosis could improve the rate of detection of HBV infection. The incorporation of a genotype-F-derived HBsAg vaccine in areas where this genotype is endemic should be evaluated, since this might also affect vaccination efficacy.</p></details></div>

In this study, we show that this difference is partly due to the N-glycosylation of the recombinant CFP32 (rCFP32) by the yeast Pichia pastoris. In addition, SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis of Mycobacterium bovis BCG and yeast-produced rCFP32 showed the presence of a band corresponding to a homodimeric state of the protein, unlike that of rCFP32 produced in E. coli. Computational modeling indicates that a single cysteine residue at position 193 of each monomer might bond to stabilize the homodimeric state of CFP32. Computational study showed that this residue is buried inside the protein core of E. coli-produced rCFP32 suggesting that rCFP32 may adopt a different folding in P. pastoris and BCG, in which C193 is solvent exposed. Surprisingly, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a generated monoclonal antibody (14D4) reveals the presence of a differential epitope that appears to be the consequence of the protein dimerization of the yeast- and BCG-, but not E.coli- produced, CFP32 recombinant form.

A linear cationic hybrid peptide, LL-37Talpha1 was derived from two parental peptides (LL-37 and Talpha1) recognized as potent anti-endotoxin without any hemolytic or cytotoxic activity. We successfully cloned the gene of hybrid peptide LL-37Talpha1 in PpICZalphaA vector and expressed in the Pichia pastoris. The recombinant peptide was purified by Ni-affinity column and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with an estimated molecular mass of 3.9 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. We analyzed the LPS neutralization by limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) activity and the results indicate that the hybrid peptide LL-37Talpha1 directly binds endotoxin and significantly (p < 0.05) neutralizes the effect of LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay revealed that LL-37Talpha1 successfully reduces the LPS-induced cytotoxicity in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, it significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the levels of nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and diminished the number of apoptotic cells in LPS-stimulated mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Our results suggest that the P. pastoris expression system is cost-effective for commercial production of the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory hybrid peptide (IAHP) LL-37Talpha1 and the peptide may serve as effective anti-endotoxin/anti-inflammatory agent with minimal cytotoxicity.</p></details></div>

The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange, hydrophobic, and gel filtration. TmEgl5A showed a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The single band of the protein was analyzed by peptide-mass-finger-printing using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the trypsin-digested peptide sequences were matched to a putative endoglucanase sequence (protein ID1465229) in the JGI T. matsutake 945 v3.0 genome database. Based on the sequence information, the gene encoding TmEgl was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71H. The deduced amino acid sequence was similar to GH5 family endoglucanases from Basidiomycetes. The enzyme acts on barley beta-glucan, lichenan, and CMC-Na. The hydrolyzation products from these substrates were detected by thin-layer chromatography as oligosaccharides with minimal disaccharides. These results suggested that T. matsutake produces a typical endoglucanase in solid-state culture, and the fungus has the potential to degrade beta-linkage polysaccharides.</p></details></div>

A new thermo-stable feruloyl esterase gene, TtfaeB was identified from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris h408. Deduced protein sequence shares the identity of 67% with FAEB from Neurospora crassa. The expression vector pPIC9K-TtfaeB was successfully constructed and electro-transformed into GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. One transformant with high feruloyl esterase yield was obtained through plate screening and named TtFAEB1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of fermentation supernatant from transformant TtFAEB1 showed a distinct protein band appearing at the position of about 35-kDa, indicating that TtfaeB gene has been successfully expressed in P. pastoris. The recombinant TtFAEB was purified by affinity chromatography and the specific activity of purified TtFAEB was 6.06 +/- 0.72 U/mg. The optimal temperature and pH for purified recombinant TtFAEB was 60 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. TtFAEB was thermostable, retaining 96.89 and 84.16% of the maximum activity after being treated for 1 h at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the enzyme was stable in the pH range 4.5-8.0. The homology model of TtFAEB showed that it consists of a single domain adopting a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser117, Asp201, and His260. TtFAEB in association with xylanase from Trichoderma reesei could release 77.1% of FA from destarched wheat bran. The present results indicated that the recombinant TtFAEB with excellent enzymatic properties is a promising candidate for potential applications in biomass deconstruction and biorefinery.</p></details></div>

The Tk-ChiA gene was cloned and expressed on Pichia pastoris GS115. The molecular weight of the purified Tk-ChiA is about 130.0 kDa. By using chitosan, CMC-Na and other polysaccharides as substrates, we confirmed that Tk-ChiA with dual hydrolysis activity preferably hydrolyzes both chitosan and CMC-Na. Purified Tk-ChiA showed maximal activity for hydrolyzing CMC-Na at temperature 65 degrees C and pH 7.0. It showed thermal stability on incubation for 4 h at temperatures ranging from 70 to 80 degrees C and remained more than 40% of its maximum activity after pre-incubation at 100 degrees C for 4 h. Particularly, Tk-ChiA is capable of degrading shrimp shell and rice straw through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The main factors affecting shell and straw degradation were determined to be reaction time and temperature; and both factors were optimized by central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) to enhance the efficiency of degradation.

Its ability to produce phase I (oxidative) metabolites of drugs is associated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity; however, almost nothing is known about these enzymes in the fungus. In this paper we report the in silico analysis of the genome sequence of C. elegans B9769, which contains 32 genes putatively coding for CYPs. Based on their predicted amino acid sequences these were classified as belonging to CYP509, 5203, 5208, 5313, 5210, 61 and 51 families. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed that the gene coding for CYP5313D1 was significantly upregulated when C. elegans DSM1908 was cultivated in sabouraud dextrose in contrast to its expression in cells grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium. This corresponded to the fungus' xenobiotic biotransformation ability when grown in the two media. Heterologous expression of cyp5313D1 in Pichia pastoris resulted in a recombinant strain that biotransformed flurbiprofen to 4'-hydroxyflurbiprofen, the same metabolite generated by C. elegans cultures.

In human, multiple diseases are associated with malfunction of these organelles, which causes accumulation of ROS species and consequently the inefficient detoxification of cells. Despite intense research, much remains to be clarified about the precise molecular role of catalase in cellular homeostasis. Yeast peroxisomes and their peroxisomal catalases have been used as eukaryotic models for oxidative metabolism, ROS generation and detoxification, and associated pathologies. In order to provide reliable models for oxidative metabolism research, we have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of peroxisomal catalase from two important biotechnology and basic biology yeast models, Pichia pastoris and Kluyveromyces lactis. We have performed an extensive functional, biochemical and stability characterization of both enzymes in order to establish their differential activity profiles. Furthermore, we have analyzed the role of the peroxisomal catalase under study in the survival of yeast to oxidative burst challenges combining methanol, water peroxide, and sodium chloride. Interestingly, whereas catalase activity was induced 200-fold upon challenging the methylotrophic P. pastoris cells with methanol, the increase in catalase activity in the non-methylotrophic K. lactis was only moderate. The inhibitory effect of sodium azide and beta-mercaptoethanol over both catalases was analyzed, establishing IC50 values for both compounds that are consistent with an elevated resistance of both enzymes toward these inhibitors. Structural comparison of these two novel catalase structures allows us to rationalize the differential susceptibility to inhibitors and oxidative bursts. The inherent worth and validity of the P. pastoris and K. lactis yeast models for oxidative damage will be strengthened by the availability of reliable structural-functional information on these enzymes, which are central to our understanding of peroxisomal response toward oxidative stress.</p></details></div>

The NEPVs were designed by engineering of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) determined by in silico analyses and manual curation systematically, by (a) single-handedly replacement of specified TFBSs with synthetic motifs for Mxr1, Cat8, and Aca1 binding, and synthetic TATA-box integration; and, (b) nucleosome optimization. PADH2-Cat8-L2 and PADH2-Cat8-L1 designed by the integration of synthetic Cat8 binding sites were superior, and then PADH2-NucOpt . Compared to that with PADH2 at t = 20 hr of the fermentations, PADH2-Cat8-L2 allowed the highest increase in enhanced green fluorescent protein expression as 4.8-fold on ethanol and 3.8-fold on methanol; and, PADH2-NucOpt upregulated the expression 1.5-fold on ethanol and enhanced 3.2-fold on methanol. Using the superior two tools, Cat8-L2 and NucOpt, we designed PADH2-NucOpt-Cat8-L2 . With PADH2-NucOpt-Cat8-L2 , the expression in the fermentation of ethanol was upregulated 3.7-fold that is distinctly higher than that with PADH2-NucOpt but lower than that with PADH2-Cat8-L2 ; while on methanol compared to that with PADH2 , the expression was enhanced 8.8-fold. Extracellular recombinant human serum albumin production was also studied with PADH2-Cat8-L2 and PADH2-NucOpt , and average recombinant human serum albumin yield (YP/X ) on ethanol was 1.13 and 0.38 mg/gWCW, respectively; whereas with PADH2 , YP/X was 0.26 mg/gWCW . We conclude that as upregulation of transcription and enhanced expression correlate with the sequence of synthetic motifs and their location in the hybrid-promoter architectures of NEPVs in coordination with trans-acting factors, which are the design parameters in the engineering of binding sites; the NEPVs generated promising recombinant protein production platforms with a high impact on industrial scale production processes, as well as would open up new avenues for research in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

In this regard, Pichia pastoris has become one of the most attractive host platforms for large-scale production of xylanases. However, genomic engineering is still required for overexpression and efficient secretion. In this paper, we applied droplet-based method to screen directed evolved extracellular xylanase producing P. pastoris strain. Xylanase-producing P. pastoris cells were encapsulated in gel microdroplets with a fluorogenic reporter substrate. Improved production of xylanase increases fluorescence intensity of gel microdroplets, enabled accurate selection of evolved clones by droplet sorting. The screening strategy was validated by identifying yeast with improved xylanase production from a mixed sample with a positive selection accuracy of up to 98%. After three rounds of mutagenesis and selection, approximately 10(8) variants were screened, and a P. pastoris clone with more than 1.3-fold increase in xylanase activity was identified, representing cellular functions improvement of the production host. The throughput of this approach was at least 10(3)-fold higher than that of the robot-assisted microtiter plate reader, and reagent consumption was reduced by approximately 10(6)-fold. Furthermore, the greatly shortened incubation time prior screening significantly accelerated the process of directed evolution.</p></details></div>

We used the same method to produce the beta subunit of the hormone, against which polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits. We first confirmed immunoreactivity of the polyclonal antibodies with the recombinant full length FSH and FSHbeta as well as plasma and pituitary FSH of sexually immature and mature yellowtail kingfish by Western blot analysis. We then developed a precise and reproducible ELISA for yellowtail kingfish FSH and validated the assay in plasma and pituitary extracts. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation was <2.2% and 10.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay was 78pg/ml. For further validation of the assay, we measured the plasma FSH in immature yellowtail kingfish treated with increasing doses (blank, 50, 100 and 150microg/kg) of kisseptin2-10 peptide from a previous study. The dose response observed in treated females was not significant, however the increased plasma FSH levels coincided with the significantly higher estradiol levels we previously reported in the treated groups. We assessed the applicability of the assay in measuring circulating FSH in other species. We observed parallelism between the linearized FSH standard curve and displacement curves of serially diluted plasma from Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). We also observed similar parallelism with full length recombinant giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) FSH.

Their effects were investigated using three reporter proteins: yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP), beta-galactosidase (Gal) and cephalosporin C acylase (SECA), in comparison with the commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor pre-pro leader sequence (alpha-MF) or folding factors (Pdi1p, BiP, and Hac1p). The newly identified signal sequences were superior over alpha-MF for production of heterologous proteins. The signal peptide Msb2 increased the specific extracellular production of all reporter proteins, ranging from 1.5- to 8.0-fold, and Dan4 enhanced all total protein production up to 172-fold. Co-expression of folding factors exhibited a protein-specific effect on cell growth, transcription and expression of different reporter genes. All of the novel folding factors enhanced total production of SECA, and Sil1p performed best in the extracellular SECA production, showing a 3.3-fold increase.

Glycosylation may play a role in regulating the Lcc9 specific activity. To elucidate this hypothesis, in this study, firstly we demonstrated that rLcc9 and nLcc9 were glycoproteins, and then enzymatically deglycosylated them. The obtained drLcc9 and dnLcc9 showed an apparent decrease in their specific activities. Three putative N-glycosylation sites (N293, N313, and N454) were then predicted in Lcc9 and substituted to evaluate their roles in its specific activity. Molecular weight analysis on those mutants suggested that glycosylation should have occurred on N313 and N454 whereas not on N293 in rLcc9. Comparison of catalytic properties of those mutants revealed that glycosylation at N313 and N454 in rLcc9 could affect the binding affinity to substrates and the catalytic rate, respectively. In addition, the glycosylation could also affect the thermal stability of rLcc9 and nLcc9 since deglycosylation of those Lcc9s resulted in decreases in their thermal stability to some extent. These results will help us to understand the effect of glycosylation on biochemical characteristics of fungal laccases, and provide us support for the improvement of fungal laccase activity based on N-linked glycosylation modification.</p></details></div>

Among the different efficient host organism alternatives commonly used for protein production, the yeast Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is currently considered to be one of the most effective and versatile expression platforms. The promising features of this cell factory are giving rise to interesting studies covering the different aspects that contribute to improving the bioprocess efficiency, from strain engineering to bioprocess engineering. The numerous drawbacks of using methanol in industrial processes are driving interest towards methanol-free alternatives, among which the GAP promoter-based systems stand out. The aim of this work is to present the most promising innovative developments in operational strategies based on rational approaches through bioprocess engineering tools. This rational design should be based on physiological characterization of the producing strains under bioprocess conditions and its interrelation with specific rates. This review focuses on understanding the key factors that can enhance recombinant protein production in Pichia pastoris; they are the basis for a further discussion on future industrial applications with the aim of developing scalable alternative strategies that maximize yields and productivity.</p></details></div>

The use of such an approach is restricted by how well a targeted polypeptide can be efficiently ligated. Recently, an Asx-specific peptide ligase identified from a tropical cyclotide-producing plant and named butelase 1 exhibited excellent cyclization kinetics that cannot be matched by other known ligases, including intein, PATG, PCY1, and sortase A. In this work, we aimed to examine whether butelase 1 facilitated protein conformational stability for structural investigation. First, we successfully expressed recombinant butelase 1 (rBTase) in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Next, rBTase was shown to be highly efficient in the cyclization of the p53-binding domain (N-terminal domain) of murine double minute X (N-MdmX), an important target for designing anticancer drugs. The cyclized N-MdmX (cMdmX) exhibited increased conformational stability and improved interaction with the ligand compared with those of noncyclized N-MdmX. Importantly, the thermal melting process was completely reversible, contrary to noncyclized N-MdmX, and the melting temperature ( Tm) of cMdmX was increased to 47 from 43 degrees C. This stable conformation of cMdmX was further confirmed by (15)N-(1)H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The complex of cMdmX and the ligand was tested for protein crystallization, and several promising findings were revealed. Therefore, our work not only provides a recombinant version of butelase 1 but also suggests a conventional approach for preparing stable protein samples for both protein crystallization and NMR structural investigation.</p></details></div>

AGT is specifically cleaved by renin to produce angiotensin-I, the first product of the angiotensin-processing cascade. Ovine angiotensinogen (oAGT) is considered an effective substrate for human renin and consequently finds application in clinical renin assays. In this study, oAGT was cloned into the genome of Pichia pastoris and expressed under the control of alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter for high-level production. Compared to the shake flask study, the high cell density cultivation in bioreactor resulted in multifold increase in oAGT titer (420 +/- 9.26 mg/L), which is its highest reported titer to date. We purified recombinant oAGT to homogeneity using two chromatography steps. The characterization studies revealed oAGT underwent a two-state transition during thermal denaturation process as assessed by differential scanning fluorimetry, and the melting temperature (Tm ) of the purified oAGT from P. pastoris was 48.3 degrees C. Renin reactivity with recombinant oAGT from P. pastoris (0.51 nM angiotensin-I/min) was slightly lower than the renin reactivity for recombinant oAGT from Escherichia coli (0.67 nM angiotensin-I/min), possibly because of its mannosylated N-glycan content. Enhanced production of functionally active recombinant oAGT using P. pastoris expression system reported in this study envisage the effective utilization of oAGT in clinical studies related to renin in near future.</p></details></div>

It was found that no CGTase was expressed using traditional defined medium (basal salt medium [BSM]) because of pH value decreasing significantly. CGTase was expressed by recombinant K. phaffii through pH maintenance in range of 5.5-7.0. beta-CGTase activity increased to 122.0 U/mL after optimization of glycerol, phosphate buffer, pH value, ammonium sulfate, temperature, methanol, and additives based on BSM, establishing a modified defined medium.

The clinical outcome of the approved recombinant human IFN alpha2b drugs in the market suffers from short plasma half-life, rapid clearance and other side effects. Human IFN alpha2b expression in mammalian cell lines results in significant heterogeneity in glycan moieties, inconsistent product quality and high production cost. Potential scope exists for the design and development of a successful expression platform for enhanced human IFN alpha2b production with improved pharmacokinetic property. Glycoengineering strategy was employed to construct IFN alpha2b with potential N-glycosylation site to evade the drawbacks of approved recombinant human IFN alpha2b drugs. Heterogeneity of glycosylation and hypermannosylation in the wild-type strains of Pichia pastoris was circumvented by employing glycoengineered strain (SuperMan5) to produce glycosylated IFN alpha2b with human type N-glycans. Recombinant SuperMan5 strain expressed human type N-glycosylated IFN alpha2b with greater homogeneity elucidated by glycan analysis (MALDI-TOF/MS). The purified glycosylated IFN alpha2b was biologically active, inhibiting the viral replication of HCV and HEV at 85% and 66%, respectively.

The advantages of using hydrocyclone in biomass separation could be summarized in its suitability for continuous separation and its low risk of contamination. To evaluate the performance of hydrocyclone, concentration ratio in underflow to feed stream, capacity, and centrifugal force by considering three parameters of pressure drop, concentration, and the type of hydrocyclone were investigated. Using three level factorial design a concentration ratio equation was developed, with the correlation coefficient R(2) = 0.977 ensured the good fitness of the predicted data with the experimental results. In optimal conditions, maximum concentration ratio was 1.246, for flow rate 13.5 LPM and C-force equal to 1276.11 at maximum pressure drop (3 bar) and minimum concentration (0.5% w/w) in hydrocyclone 1.

For this purpose, in large-scale fed-batch fermentation, using methanol for HBsAg induction and cell growth, three parameters of average specific growth rate, biomass yield, and dry biomass concentration-in the definite integral form with respect to fermentation time-were selected as input vectors; the final concentration of HBsAg was selected for the ANN output. Used dataset consists of 38 runs from previous batches; feed-forward ANN 3:5:1 with training algorithm of backpropagation based on a Bayesian regularization was trained and tested with a high degree of accuracy.

For the generation of knockouts in the industrially important yeast Pichia pastoris, several protocols have been published to date. Nevertheless, creating a targeted knockout in P. pastoris still is a time-consuming process, as the existing protocols are labour intensive and/or prone to accumulate nucleotide mutations. In this study, we introduce a novel, user-friendly vector-based system for the generation of targeted knockouts in P. pastoris. Upon confirming the successful knockout, respective selection markers can easily be recycled. Excision of the marker is mediated by Flippase (Flp) recombinase and occurs at high frequency (>/=95%). We validated our knockout system by deleting 20 (confirmed and putative) protease genes and five genes involved in biosynthetic pathways. For the first time, we describe gene deletions of PRO3 and PHA2 in P. pastoris, genes involved in proline, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, respectively. Unexpectedly, knockout strains of PHA2 did not display the anticipated auxotrophy for phenylalanine but rather showed a bradytroph phenotype on minimal medium hinting at an alternative but less efficient pathway for production of phenylalanine exists in P. pastoris. Overall, all knockout vectors can easily be adapted to the gene of interest and strain background by efficient exchange of target homology regions and selection markers in single cloning steps. Average knockout efficiencies for all 25 genes were shown to be 40%, which is comparably high.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a panel of episomal plasmids containing various autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) were constructed and their performance in transformation efficiency, copy numbers, and propagation stability were systematically compared. Among the five ARSs with different origins, panARS isolated from Kluyveromyces lactis was determined to have the best performance and used to develop an efficient CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing system. Compared with a previously reported system using the endogenous and most commonly used ARS (PARS1), the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing efficiency was increased for more than tenfold.

Evaluation of different induction strategies indicated that it was possible to increase Pgp expression by inducing the culture with 20% media containing 2.5% methanol. By quantifying methanol, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and formate, and by measuring alcohol oxidase, catalase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases, it was possible to correlate Pgp expression to the induction strategy. Inducing the culture by adding methanol with fresh media was associated with decreases in formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, and increases in formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases. At these conditions, Pgp expression was 1400-fold higher, an indication that Pgp expression is affected by increases in formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. It is possible that Pgp is responsible for this behaviour, since the increased metabolite concentrations and decreased enzymatic activities were not observed when parental Pichia was subjected to the same growth conditions.

With the advancement of nanotechnology and the development of magnetic nanoparticles, these structures are increasingly used in different applications. In the present study, we produced the recombinant human growth hormone from Pichia pastoris and for protein separation provided the surfaces similar to chromatographic columns on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles. For this purpose, using a co-precipitation method, the core of Fe3O4 was prepared and coated by silica. To increase the protein availability, silica mesoporous formation and its amine functionalization were performed. The specific surface area and the pore size were determined 78.3189m(2)/g and 7.44nm. After the magnetic separation, the sample loading in SDS gel shows a reduction in protein band and the protein absorption at a wavelength of 280nm. Finally, we evaluate the ability of amine functionalized nanoparticles for protein separation that demonstrate the adsorption capacity significantly increased compare with silica-coated nanoparticles. The amine functionalized nanoparticles provide the maximum adsorption capacity of 235.21mug/mg and after the elution, protein concentration determined 476mg/L.

Pharmacologic inhibition of factor XII is an attractive alternative in providing protection from pathologic thrombus formation while minimizing hemorrhagic risk. Large quantity of recombinant active factor XII is required for screening inhibitors and further research. In the present study, we designed and expressed the recombinant serine protease domain of factor XII in Pichia pastoris strain X-33, which is a eukaryotic expression model organism with low cost. The purification protocol was simplified and the protein yield was high (~20 mg/L medium). The purified serine protease domain of factor XII behaved homogeneously as a monomer, exhibited comparable activity with the human betaFXIIa, and accelerated clot formation in human plasma. This study provides the groundwork for factor XII inhibitors screening and further research.</p></details></div>

In the present study, we have aimed to understand the effect of two natural variants of HSA, such as Herborn (K240E) and Milano Slow (D375H) on the binding of phenylbutazone and ibuprofen. For this, we have generated K240E and D375H mutants and also double mutant (K240E/D375H) of HSA using site directed mutagenesis. The recombinant HSA and its variants were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The interaction of HSA and its variants to phenylbutazone and ibuprofen was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results showed that there is no significant effect of K240E and D375H mutations on phenylbutazone and ibuprofen binding. But the effect is significant when both the mutations were there in a single protein (K240E/D375H). Further, the CD spectroscopy data showed that there is no effect of phenylbutazone and ibuprofen binding on the conformation of protein, except in case of D375H, where there is a conformational change in the binding pocket with the ibuprofen binding.</p></details></div>

We describe a combined method using screening and in silico algorithms for ranking chromatographic steps to rapidly design orthogonally selective integrated processes for purifying protein therapeutics from both process- and product-related impurities. IFN-alpha2b produced in Pichia pastoris containing a significant product variant challenge was used as a case study. The product and product-related variants were screened on a set of 14 multimodal, ion exchange, and hydrophobic charge induction chromatography resins under various pH and salt linear gradient conditions. Data generated from reversed-phase chromatography of the fractions collected were used to generate a retention database for IFN-alpha2b and its variants. These data, in combination with a previously constructed process-related impurity database for P. pastoris, were input into an in silico process development tool that generated and ranked all possible integrated chromatographic sequences for their ability to remove both process and product-related impurities. Top-ranking outputs guided the experimental refinement of two successful three step purification processes, one comprising all bind-elute steps and the other having two bind-elute steps and a flowthrough operation. This approach suggests a new platform-like approach for rapidly designing purification processes for a range of proteins where separations of both process- and product-related impurities are needed.</p></details></div>

The cellobiohydrolase from Lentinula edodes (LeCel7A) was produced in Pichia pastoris. The optimal temperature and pH for LeCel7A were 60 degrees C and 5.0, respectively. The recombinant protein enhanced the hydrolysis of three straws. During in vitro rumen fermentation of three straws, the fiber digestibility, concentration of acetate and total volatile fatty acids, and fermentation liquid microbial protein were increased by LeCel7A. High throughput sequencing and real-time PCR data showed that the effects of LeCel7A on ruminal microbial community depended on the fermentation substrates. The relative abundances of Prevotellaceae_UCG_003 and Saccharofermentans were increased by LeCel7A regardless of agricultural straws. With rice straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Desulfovibrio, Ruminococcaceae and its some genus. With wheat straw, LeCel7A increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus. With corn straw, Succiniclasticum, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group and Desulfovibrio were increased by LeCel7A.

The use of glucose as a carbon source in the growth phase led to a remarkable increase in cell size compared with glycerol, while the smallest cells were obtained with sucrose likely due to the occurrence of an energetic stress. The scFv concentration seemed to be related to cell number rather than to cell concentration, which in its turn showed no significant dependence on the carbon source. Yeast cells grown on sucrose had a mean diameter (0.736 +/- 0.097 mum) about 35% shorter than those grown on glucose and allowed for the highest final concentration of the scFv antibody fragment (93.7 +/- 0.2 mg/L).

Therefore, searching for more effective compounds to reduce the toxicity of treatments, while still producing similar effects as current chemotherapy regimens, is required. Currently, the search for potential anticancer agents involves a random, inaccurate process with strategic deficits and a lack of specific targets. For this reason, the initial in vitro highthroughput steps in the screening process should be reviewed for rapid identification of the compounds that may serve as anticancer agents. The present study aimed to investigate the potential use of the Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H expressing DNA topoisomerase I (SMD1168HTOPOI) in a yeastbased assay for screening potential anticancer agents. The cell density that indicated the growth of the recombinant yeast without treatment was first measured by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the effects of glutamate (agonist) and camptothecin (antagonist) on the recombinant yeast cell density were investigated using the same approach, and finally, the effect of camptothecin on various cell lines was determined and compared with its effect on recombinant yeast. The current study demonstrated that growth was enhanced in SMD1168HTOPOI as compared with that in SMD1168H. Glutamate also enhanced the growth of the SMD1168H; however, the growth effect was not enhanced in SMD1168HTOPOI treated with glutamate. By contrast, camptothecin caused only lower cell density and growth throughout the treatment of SMD1168HTOPOI. The findings of the current study indicated that SMD1168HTOPOI has similar characteristics to MDAMB231 cells; therefore, it can be used in a yeastbased assay to screen for more effective compounds that may inhibit the growth of highly metastatic breast cancer cells.</p></details></div>

The application of this expression platform is restricted by the toxicity and inflammatory nature of methanol, especially in food and pharmaceutical products. Human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) is an important pharmaceutical protein, playing a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of innate immune cells. In this study, a methanol-free expression platform for extracellular expression of hGM-CSF was developed. To attain this goal, a novel constructed expression vector pEP(alpha)101, carrying the FMD promoter regulating recombinant expression by glycerol derepression was designed. The optimized hGM-CSF gene was subcloned into pEP(alpha)101 and transformed into P. pastoris. The expression of rhGM-CSF in three different culture media were investigated. Based on the observed heterogeneous glycosylation pattern on SDS-PAGE and western blot, the glycoproteins were deglycosylated to remove carbohydrate units. According to the results, the novel methanol independent PFMD expression platform would be a suitable candidate for driving heterologous gene expression especially for the production of food-grade and therapeutically important recombinant proteins.</p></details></div>

This device allows the real-time comparison between the ethanol intake, its cerebral concentrations, and their effect on the motion when the animal is in the condition of voluntary drinking. To this end, we assessed in vitro the efficiency of three different biosensor designs loading diverse alcohol oxidase enzymes (AOx) obtained from three different AOx-donor strains: Hansenula polymorpha, Candida boidinii, and Pichia pastoris. In vitro data disclosed that the devices loading H. polymorpha and C. boidinii were similarly efficient (respectively, linear region slope [LRS]: 1.98 +/- 0.07 and 1.38 +/- 0.04 nA/mM) but significantly less than the P. pastoris-loaded one (</p><p><strong>LRS:</strong> 7.57 +/- 0.12 nA/mM).

At the same time, the microvibration sensor detected a significant increase in the rat's motion signal. Notably, both the biosensor and microvibration sensor described similar and parallel time-dependent U-shaped curves, thus providing a highly sensitive and time-locked high-resolution detection of the neurochemical and behavioral kinetics upon voluntary ethanol intake.

Fungal defensin-like peptides (DLPs) are emerging as a potential source of new antibacterial drugs due to their potent antibacterial activity. In this study, nine novel fungal DLPs were firstly identified by querying against UniProt databases and expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their antibacterial and anti-biofilm ability were tested against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus. Results showed that among them, P2, the highest activity and expression level, showed low toxicity, no resistance, and high stability. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of P2 against Gram-positive bacteria were < 2 mug/mL. P2 exhibited the potent activity against intracellular MDR S. aureus (bacterial reduction in 80-97%) in RAW264.7 macrophages. P2 bound to/disrupted bacterial DNA, wrinkled outer membranes and permeabilized cytoplasmic membranes, but maintained the integrity of bacterial cells. P2 inhibited/eradicated the biofilm and killed 99% persister bacteria, which were resistant to 100x MIC vancomycin. P2 upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha/IL-1beta) and chemokine (MCP-1) levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages and in mice, respectively. Five milligram per kilogram P2 enhanced the survival of S. aureus-infected mice (100%), superior to vancomycin (30 mg/kg), inhibited the bacterial translocation, and alleviated multiple-organ injuries (liver, spleen, kidney, and lung). These data suggest that P2 may be a candidate for novel antimicrobial agents against MDR staphylococcal infections.</p></details></div>

Herein, two distinct A2M genes (designated as PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2, respectively) were isolated from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 encoded proteins with 1541 or 1516 amino acids, respectively, containing the typically functional domains of A2M. Unlike highly expressed in hemocytes of most arthropods, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 were predominantly detected in gill, eyestalk and digestive tracks. During the embryonic stages, PtA2Ms were found to be expressed most highly in fertilized eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. After challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcripts of PtA2Ms showed similar time-dependent response expression pattern, while PtA2M-1 was more sensitive to Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris infection than PtA2M-2. Knockdown of PtA2M-1 or PtA2M-2 could significantly enhance the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and serine protease related genes (PtcSP1-3 and PtSPH), however, PtLSZ and the phagocytosis-related genes (PtMyosin and PtRab5) were effectively inhibited. These results were further supported by the PO and lysozyme activities in hemolymph of the PtA2M-1- or PtA2M-2-silenced crabs. In addition, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 could regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (PtALF1-3, PtCrustin1 and PtCrustin3) through the Toll and NF-kappaB pathways. Our findings together suggest that PtA2Ms might function in crab host defense via regulating the proPO system, phagocytosis and the expression of AMP genes.</p></details></div>

The phospholipase D-mediated green synthesis of phosphatidylserine has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In this study, the phospholipase D was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. The highest activity of phospholipase D was observed in C. glutamicum, which was 0.25 U/mL higher than these in B. subtilis (0.14 U/mL) and P. pastoris (0.22 U/mL). System engineering of three potential factors, including (1) signal peptides, (2) ribosome binding site, and (3) promoters, was attempted to improve the expression level of phospholipase D in C. glutamicum. The maximum phospholipase D activity reached 1.9 U/mL, which was 7.6-fold higher than that of the initial level. The enzyme displayed favorable transphosphatidylation activity and it could efficiently catalyze the substrates L-serine and soybean lecithin for synthesis of phosphatidylserine after optimizing the conversion reactions in detail. Under the optimum conditions (trichloromethane/enzyme solution 4:2, 8 mg/mL soybean lecithin, 40 mg/mL L-serine, and 15 mM CaCl2, with shaking under 40 degrees C for 10 h), the reaction process showed 48.6% of conversion rate and 1.94 g/L of accumulated phosphatidylserine concentration. The results highlight the use of heterologous expression, system engineering, and process optimization strategies to adapt a promising phospholipase D for efficient phosphatidylserine production in synthetic application.</p></details></div>

It has been challenging to develop a high performance alpha-galactosidase excelled on catalytic efficiency, thermostability, pH stability and protease-resistance that could efficiently hydrolyze RFOs. In this study, the first GH family 27 alpha-galactosidase gene from Irpex lacteus was cloned. The gene had an open reading frame of 1314bp interrupted by 12 introns. The recombinant alpha-galactosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris (rILgalA) had an apparent molecular mass of 64kDa and was highly N-glycosylated. rILgalA was maximally active at pH4.8 and 70 degrees C. It was stable over a broad pH range of 3-11, retained 90% of its activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 10h and exhibited strong resistance to digestive proteases. Unlike many other alpha-galactosidases, rILgalA was hyperactive on RFOs. Its specific activities toward melibiose, raffinose and stachyose were 644, 755 and 833Umg(-1), respectively. The corresponding Kcat/Km values were 120, 130 and 180mM(-1)s(-1), which were the highest among reported alpha-galactosidases. rILgalA almost completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose in soymilk at 60 degrees C in 30min. These superior properties would make rILgalA an ideal remover of RFOs in food and feed industries.</p></details></div>

In mammals, p40 can be secreted as a monomer or homodimer and acts independently to mediate cellular responses. Recently, three p40 paralogues were isolated and identified from grass carp and other fish species, but whether they exist independently as well as their functional consequences and significance remain unclear. In the present study, using grass carp as the model, we for the first time demonstrated the existence of natural fish p40a, p40b and p40c (gcp40a, gcp40b and gcp40c) mainly as a monomer in culture supernatant of head kidney leukocytes (HKLs). Particularly, their excessive secretion induced by various immune stimuli suggests possible involvement of free p40s in fish immune responses. To define their functions, recombinant grass carp p40a/b/c (rgcp40a, rgcp40b and rgcp40c) were prepared by Pichia pastoris expression system, and they possessed the activities to enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) in grass carp HKLs. These pro-inflammatory properties of p40 isoforms prompted us to investigate their roles during the inflammatory process. In line with this, in vivo study revealed the pathogenic effect of rgcp40a on intestinal inflammation, whereas gcp40a polyclonal antibodies remarkably ameliorated Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal histopathological changes. Taken together, our results uncover the biological significance of free p40s in teleost, and provide new clue for targeting fish intestinal inflammation.</p></details></div>

In this study, a novel mannose-binding lectin was cloned from the swimmimg crab Portunus trituberculatus (designated as PtMBL). The complete cDNA of PtMBL gene was 1208 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 732 bp that encoded 244 amino acid proteins. PtMBL shared lower amino acid similarity with other MBLs, yet it contained the conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with QPD motif and was clearly member of the collectin family. PtMBL transcripts were mainly detected in eyestalk and gill with sexually dimorphic expression. The temporal expression of PtMBL in hemocytes showed different activation times after challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The recombinant PtMBL protein revealed antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It could also bind and agglutinate (Ca(2+)-dependent) both bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, the agglutinating activity could be inhibited by both d-galactose and d-mannose, suggesting the broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition spectrum of PtMBL.

To increase the potency of SAK and to minimize vessel reocclusion, a new construct bearing SAK motif fused to tsetse thrombin inhibitor (TTI) via a 20-amino acid linker with 2 RGD (2 x arginine-glycine-aspartic acid inhibiting platelet aggregation via attachment to integrin receptors of platelet) was codon optimized and expressed comparatively in Pichia pastoris GS115 as a Mut(+) strain and KM71H as a Mut(s) strain. Fusion protein was optimized in terms of best expression condition and fibrinolytic activity and compared with the rSAK. Expression level of the designed construct reached up to 175 mg/L of the culture medium after 72-hr stimulation with 2.5% methanol and remained steady for 3-4 days. The highest expression was obtained at the range of 2-3% methanol. The SAK-2RGD-TT (relative activity >82%) was more active at 25-37 degrees C than rSAK (relative activity of 93%). Further, it showed relative activity >80% at pH ranges of 7-9. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 27 and 24 kDa at ratio of 5 to 3, respectively. The specific fibrinolytic activity of the SAK-2RGD-TTI was measured as 8,269 U/mg, and 19,616 U/mg for the nonpurified and purified proteins, respectively. Deglycosylation by using tunicamycin in culture medium resulted in higher fibrinolytic activity of SAK-2RGD-TTI (2.2 fold). Consequently, compared to the rSAK, at the same equimolar proportion, addition of RGD and TTI fragments could increase fibrinolytic activity. Also, P. pastoris can be considered as an efficient host for overexpression of the soluble SAK-2RGD-TTI with high activity without requiring a complicated purification procedure.</p></details></div>

Currently, enzyme replacement therapy using an enzyme produced in CHO cells represents the main treatment option for MPS IVA patients. As an alternative, we reported the production of an active GALNS enzyme produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris (prGALNS), which showed internalization by cultured cells through a potential receptor-mediated process and similar post-translational processing as human enzyme. In this study, we further studied the therapeutic potential of prGALNS through the characterization of the N-glycosylation structure, in vitro cell uptake and keratan sulfate reduction, and in vivo biodistribution and generation of anti-prGALNS antibodies.

A significant change in the spectrum of Lcc1, indicative of unfolding of secondary structures, was observed with increasing concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) during Trp fluorescence, absorption and CD measurements. A similar trend was also noticed for enzyme activity with respect to GdnHCl concentrations. To establish the role of copper ion in the catalytic activity of laccase, a complete removal of copper was carried out and addition of copper was found to restore the structure and activity during the refolding process.

The rhLf revealed an effective CC50 of 91.4 and 109.46 microg/ml on non-metastatic and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, with favorable selective cytotoxicity index values, 11.68 and 13.99, respectively. Moreover, rhLf displayed satisfactory SCI values on four additional cell lines, MDA-MB-468, HCC70, MCF-7 and T-47D (1.55-3.34). Also, rhLf provoked plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage in MDA-MB-231 cells, being all three apoptosis-related morphological changes. Also, rhLf was able to shrink the microfilaments, forming a punctuated cytoplasmic pattern in both the MDA-MB-231 and Hs-27 cells, as visualized in confocal photomicrographs. Moreover, performing flow cytometric analysis, rhLf provoked significant phosphatidylserine externalization, cell cycle arrest in the S phase and apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Hence, rhLf possesses selective cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells. Also, rhLf caused apoptosis-associated morphologic changes, disruption of F-actin cytoskeleton organization, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and arrest of the cell cycle progression on triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall results suggest that rhLf is using the apoptosis pathway as its mechanism to inflict cell death.

However, practical implementation of hydrophobins at large scale has been hindered by low recombinant yields. In this study, the effects of increasing hydrophobin gene copy number and overexpressing endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone proteins Kar2p, Pdi1p, and Ero1p were explored as a means to enhance recombinant yields of the class II hydrophobin HFBI in the eukaryotic expression host Pichia pastoris. One-, 2-, and 3-copy-HFBI strains were attained using an in vitro multimer ligation approach, with strains displaying copy number stability following subsequent transformations as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Increasing HFBI copy number alone had no effect on increasing HFBI secretion, but increasing copy number in concert with chaperone overexpression synergistically increased HFBI secretion. Overexpression of PDI1 or ERO1 caused insignificant changes in HFBI secretion in 1- and 2-copy strains, but a statistically significant HFBI secretion increase in 3-copy strain. KAR2 overexpression consistently resulted in enhanced HFBI secretion in all copy number strains, with 3-copy-HFBI secreting 22+/-1.6 fold more than the 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. The highest increase was seen in 3-copy-HFBI/Ero1p overexpressing strain with 30+/-4.0 fold increase in HFBI secretion over 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain.

Thus, this study was designed to produce wild-type porcine MSPP (WT-MSPP) and its mutated form (D75A-MSPP) in yeast Pichia pastoris and to investigate its potential enhancement of myoblast growth and differentiation. In an in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP (10mug/mL) in either a regular culture medium or in a differentiation medium for 72h. In an animal trial, post-weaning C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were administered WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP for 6weeks. The results showed that C2C12 myoblasts treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP could dramatically promote cell proliferation. Both myoD and myogenin were significantly increased (p<.05) after WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP treatment. D75A-MSPP was particularly more effective than WT-MSPP in promoting myotube formation (p<.05). The post-weaning mice treated with D75A-MSPP significantly increased both body and muscle weights compared with the mock and WT-MSPP groups (p<.05). Furthermore, the mice treatment with D75A-MSPP could prevent increased glucose injection from inducing glucose elevation. Our data indicated that a mutant-type MSPP (D75A-MSPP) was superior to WT-MSPP in effectively enhancing myofiber growth due to the highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage by the bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid (BMP-1/TLD) and thus has potential applications for clinical muscle wasting diseases or for increasing muscle mass in meat-producing animals.</p></details></div>

The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-beta-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs and similarly to expansins, FgCPPs are trapped by cellulose and not by chitin, thus suggesting that these proteins interact with cellulose. A double knock-out mutant deleted of both FgCPPs encoding genes produces much more cellulase activity than the corresponding wild type strain when grown on CMC, likely compensating the absence of FgCPPs. This result prompted us to investigate a possible synergistic effect of these proteins with fungal cellulases. The incubation of FgCPPs in the presence of a fungal cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) determines an increased enzymatic activity on CMC, filter paper and wheat cell walls. The observation that FgCPPs act with a non-hydrolytic mechanism indicates that these proteins favor fungal cellulase activity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections.</p></details></div>

To obtain enzymes with enhanced catalytic efficiency (pH5.5) and excellent activity in acidic pH range, we performed structure-based rational design of a thermostable phytase (PhyAn). For this, six mutants based on different rational design strategies were constructed and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Particularly, the extracellular enzymatic activity was assessed to ensure that the produced enzymes met requirements of further analyses. Several positive mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency or pH-profile shifts were carefully examined. Biochemical and kinetic investigations of purified mutants revealed that E79K, E80K, E79K+E80K and D68K had higher catalytic efficiency than the parent enzyme by approximately 49%, 67%, 86% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, the optimum pH of mutant Y65H was shifted from 5.0 to 3.0, and the peak of D68K shifted to pH5.5. Analysis of the structural-functional relationships revealed that changes in amino acid charges, structural flexibility and space hindrance could significantly influence certain enzyme characteristics. Our results illustrate the feasibility and present a structural foundation for enhancing the phytase-catalytic efficiency and acid resistance by assembling mutations derived using rational design.</p></details></div>

To produce significant amounts of Hispidalin, a recombinant Hispidalin with an N-terminal 6xHis tag and an enterokinase sequence, for the first time, was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris cell factory. Results showed that the E. coli-derived recombinant Hispidalin did not show any antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains, whereas the P. pastoris-derived recombinant Hispidalin (rHispidalin) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against five pathogenic bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. rHispidalin also has bactericidal activity and completely killed all of the Staphylococcus aureus within 40min. Additionally, rHispidalin showed a broad range of thermostability and pH stability, and a hemolytic activity of less than 2% even at a concentration of 300mug/ml; it was resistant to trypsin and proteinase K, but was moderately sensitive to pepsin and papain. Moreover, rHispidalin effectively permeabilized the cytoplasmic membrane and disrupted the morphology of targeted bacterial cells. After an initial optimization was performed, the amount of rHispidalin accumulation could reach as high as 98.6mug/ml. These results indicate that Hispidalin could be produced on a large scale by P. pastoris and has a great potential to be utilized as a new antibacterial agent for further development.</p></details></div>

In this research, FOS produced by BfrA were characterized by HPAE-PAD analysis as a mixture of 1-kestotriose, 6(G)-kestotriose (neokestose), and to a major extent 6-kestotriose. In order to increase the FOS yield, three BfrA mutants (W14Y, W14Y-N16S and W14Y-W256Y), designed from sequence divergence between hydrolases and transferases, were constructed and constitutively expressed in the non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant glycoproteins were purified and characterized. The three mutants synthesized 6-kestotriose as the major component of a FOS mixture that includes minor amounts of tetra- and pentasaccharides. In all cases, sucrose hydrolysis was the predominant reaction. All mutants reached a similar overall FOS yield, with the average value 37.6% (w/w) being 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (12.6%, w/w). None of the mutations altered the enzyme thermophilicity and thermostability. The single mutant W14Y, with specific activity of 841 U mg(-1), represents an attractive candidate for the continuous production of FOS-containing invert syrup at pasteurization temperatures.</p></details></div>

Due solely to their presence in the Wsc-family proteins working as a plasma membrane sensor for surface stress and in a fungal beta-1,3-exoglucanse, WSC domains have been presumed to possess carbohydrate-binding property without any experimental evidence. Aiming at elucidation of function(s) of WSC domains, we characterized a WSC domain-containing alcohol oxidase from the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (PoAlcOX). Recombinant PoAlcOX produced with Pichia pastoris showed alcohol oxidase activity toward a wide range of substrates including two aliphatic alcohols, a branched-chain alcohol, a diol, and a polyol. Deletion of the WSC domain virtually unaffected oxidation of these substrates by PoAlcOX, indicating that the domain makes no contribution to the catalytic activity. In analogy to some carbohydrate-binding modules, we inferred that the WSC domain plays a role in protein anchoring, and evaluated binding capability of PoAlcOX to a set of polysaccharide components of fungal and plant cell walls. This revealed that PoAlcOX binds to xylans and fungal chitin/beta-1,3-glucan in the WSC domain-dependent manner, demonstrating for the first time the carbohydrate-binding property of the domain. Additionally, we provide evidence that PoAlcOX immobilized on birch wood xylan retains the catalytic activity. Overall, the data we collected suggest that the role of the WSC domain of PoAlcOX is not recognition of substrates but attaching the enzyme to plant and/or fungal cell wall.</p></details></div>

In this sense, nonpungent capsaicin analogues as olvanil are a feasible alternative to the unpleasant sensations produced by capsaicin while maintaining a similar pharmacological profile. Olvanil can be obtained by a lipase-catalyzed chemoenzymatic process. In the present work, recombinant Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and subsequently immobilized by cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) methodology for the synthesis of olvanil. The CALB-CLEAs were obtained directly from the fermentation broth of P. pastoris without any purification step in order to assess the role of the contaminant proteins of the crude extract as co-feeders. The CALB-CLEAs were also bioimprinted to enhance the catalytic performance in olvanil synthesis. When CALB was precipitated with isopropanol, the obtained CALB-CLEAs exhibited the highest activity in the synthesis of olvanil, regardless of the glutaraldehyde concentration. The maximum product synthesis was found at 72 hr obtaining 6.8 g L(-1) of olvanil with a reaction yield of 16%. When CALB was bioimprinted with olvanil, the synthesis was enhanced 1.3 times, reaching 10.7 g L(-1) of olvanil at 72 hr of reaction with a reaction yield of 25%. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated different morphologies of the CLEAs depending on the precipitating agent and the template used for bioimprinting. Recombinant CALB-CLEAs obtained directly from the fermentation broth are a suitable alternative to commercial enzymatic preparations for the synthesis of olvanil in organic medium.</p></details></div>

However, obtaining sufficient amounts of millipedes is difficult, and the production of the Chamberlinius hualienensis HNL (ChuaHNL) in E. coli has not been very successful. Therefore, we investigated the conditions required for high-yield heterologous production of this enzyme using Pichia pastoris. When we employed P. pastoris to express His-ChuaHNL, the yield was very low (22.6 +/- 3.8 U/L culture). Hence, we investigated the effects of ChuaHNL codon optimization and the co-production of two protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) [from P. pastoris (PpPDI) and C. hualienensis (ChuaPDI1, ChuaPDI2)] on His-ChuaHNL production. The productivity of His-ChuaHNL was increased approximately 140 times per unit culture to 3170 +/- 144.7 U/L by the co-expression of codon-optimized ChuaHNL and PpPDI. Moreover, we revealed that the N-glycosylation on ChuaHNL had a large effect on the stability, enzyme secretion, and catalytic properties of ChuaHNL in P. pastoris. This study demonstrates an economical and efficient approach for the production of HNL, and the data show that glycosylation has a large effect on the enzyme properties and the P. pastoris expression system.</p></details></div>

To lower the oxidation towards BD in A. simplex, the transformation was conducted sequentially by C1,2 dehydrogenation in A. simplex and 17beta-carbonyl reduction in recombinant P. pastoris GS115. Moreover, the reaction system was inactivated before recombinant P. pastoris GS115 was added to further inhibit the oxidation of BD by A. simplex, and the productivity of BD was improved 10.6% compared with the control. Furthermore, by optimizing the conditions of transformation from AD to BD, 4.2 g/L BD was generated with 83% productivity from 5.0 g/L AD, which was the highest productivity reported by biological method.

To date, expression hosts for purification of AID/APOBEC3 enzymes include bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Here the establishment and optimization of a yeast expression/secretion system for AID/APOBEC3s are reported, followed by comparison with the same enzymes expressed in bacterial and mammalian hosts. AID and APOBEC3G were expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, each either with an N-terminal GST tag, C-terminal V5-His tag or as untagged native form. It was verified that the yeast-expressed enzymes exhibit identical biochemical properties to those reported using bacterial and mammalian expression, indicating high fidelity of protein folding. It was demonstrated that the system can be adapted for secretion of the enzymes into the media which was used directly in various enzyme assays. The system is also amenable to elimination of bulky fusion tags, providing native untagged enzymes. Thus, P. pastoris is an advantageous expression factory for AID/APOBEC3 enzymes, considering the cost, time, efficiency and quality of the obtained enzymes. The first report is also provided here of a functionally active, untagged, secreted AID, which may become a useful research reagent.

Although increasing the gene dosage is a common strategy to improve recombinant protein productivities, P. pastoris strains harboring more than two copies of a Rhizopus oryzae lipase gene (ROL) have previously shown a decrease in cell growth, lipase production, and substrate consumption, as well as a significant transcriptional downregulation of methanol metabolism. This pointed to a potential titration effect of key transcriptional factors methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1) and methanol-induced transcription factor (Mit1) regulating methanol metabolism caused by the insertion of multiple expression vectors. To prove this hypothesis, a set of strains carrying one and four copies of ROL (1C and 4C, respectively) were engineered to coexpress one or two copies of MXR1*, coding for an Mxr1 variant insensitive to repression by 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, or one copy of MIT1. Small-scale cultures revealed that growth, Rol productivity, and methanol consumption were improved in the 4C-MXR1* and 4C-MIT1, strains growing on methanol as a sole carbon source, whereas only a slight increase in productivity was observed for re-engineered 1C strains.

However, due to lack of biochemical and enzymatic studies, PDAT has not carried forward in biocatalyst application. Here, the PDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified enzymes were studied using different acyl donors and acceptors by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography. In addition of the preferred acyl donor of PE and PC, the results identified that ScPDAT was capable of using broad acyl donors such as PA, PS, PG, MGDG, DGDG, and acyl-CoA, and ScPDAT was more likely to use unsaturated acyl donors comparing 18:0/18:1 to 18:0/18:0 phospholipids. With regard to acyl acceptors, ScPDAT preferred 1,2 to 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG), while 12:0/12:0 DAG was identified as the optimal acyl acceptor, followed by 18:1/18:1 and 18:1/16:0 DAG. Additionally, ScPDAT reveals esterification activity that can utilize methanol as acyl acceptor to generate fatty acid methyl esters.

In this study, the basal transcription of PLRA3 was assessed according to the profiles of two test strains grown in media lacking rhamnose: (1) the production of secretory beta-galactosidase in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-LacB, in which lacB expression was regulated by PLRA3, and (2) growth in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-MazF, in which the expression of mazF, which encodes an intracellular toxic protein, was controlled by PLRA3. Analyses revealed low beta-galactosidase production and non-obviously inhibited growth of the test strains, which suggests that there was a low basal transcription level of PLRA3 when rhamnose was absent. Thus, PLRA3 was an excellent candidate for genetic manipulation in P. pastoris due to its strict regulation, a strong and a low transcriptional activity with and without rhamnose, respectively. Subsequently, two systems were developed based on PLRA3 in P. pastoris: (1) an efficient markerless gene deletion system for single or multiple genes and (2) a high efficient piggyBac transposase-mediated mutation system for investigating the functions of unknown genes, as well as for the screening of expected mutants.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp.). Nonetheless, the reduced number of carbon atoms and the symmetry of the glycerol molecule has hampered the comprehensive determination of metabolic fluxes when used as the labelled C-source. Moreover, metabolic models typically used for (13)C-based flux balance analysis may be incomplete or misrepresent the actual metabolic network. To circumvent these limitations, we reduced the genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026-v3.0 into a core model and used it for the iterative fitting of metabolic fluxes to the measured mass isotope distribution of proteinogenic amino acids obtained after fractional (13)C labelling of cells with [1,3-(13)C]-glycerol. This workflow allows reliable estimates to be obtained for in vivo fluxes in P. pastoris cells growing on glycerol as sole carbon source, as well as revising previous assumptions concerning its metabolic operation, such as alternative metabolic branches, calculation of energetic parameters and proposed specific cofactor utilisation.</p></details></div>

In this study, a novel aspartic protease gene (Tlap) was identified in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Using casein as the substrate, purified recombinant TlAP showed optimal activities at pH 3.0 and 55 degrees C with a specific activity of 1795.4+/-62.8U/mg, and remained stable over a pH range of 3.0-6.0 and at temperatures of 45 degrees C and below. Moreover, the enzyme was highly resistant to most metal ions and chemical reagents except for Fe(3+) and beta-mercaptoethanol. When added to apple, orange, grape and kiwi fruit juice, it showed excellent proteolytic activity against haze-forming proteins, decreasing the turbidity by up to 49.9 nephelometry turbidity units (NTU). These favorable enzymatic properties make TlAP attractive for potential use in the juice industry.</p></details></div>
