Two laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes were identified in the genome of M. importuna SCYDJ1-A1 as putative laccase-encoding genes. The two genes, belonging to Auxiliary Activity family 1 subfamily 3, were named as MiLacA and MiLacB. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences showed that MiLacA is closest to a LMCO of M. importuna 22J1, while MiLacB had low similarity with known Morchella LMCOs. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that MiLacA was expressed at much higher levels than MiLacB throughout the entire course of artificial cultivation. MiLacA was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris as a recombinant protein. Biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme showed that MiLacA simultaneously possessed laccase and polyphenol-oxidase activities. MiLacA could be strongly inhibited by Fe(2+), which is unusual. The optimum pH was four and optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. The enzyme retained over 74% of the laccase activity after 16-h incubation at 60 degrees C, which means that its thermostability is at the forefront among the currently known laccases. Our findings may help to elucidate how the laccase of M. importuna is involved in decaying lignin in plant litter, and could also provide a candidate thermostable laccase for potential industrial application.</p></details></div>

Herein, two distinct A2M genes (designated as PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2, respectively) were isolated from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 encoded proteins with 1541 or 1516 amino acids, respectively, containing the typically functional domains of A2M. Unlike highly expressed in hemocytes of most arthropods, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 were predominantly detected in gill, eyestalk and digestive tracks. During the embryonic stages, PtA2Ms were found to be expressed most highly in fertilized eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. After challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcripts of PtA2Ms showed similar time-dependent response expression pattern, while PtA2M-1 was more sensitive to Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris infection than PtA2M-2. Knockdown of PtA2M-1 or PtA2M-2 could significantly enhance the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and serine protease related genes (PtcSP1-3 and PtSPH), however, PtLSZ and the phagocytosis-related genes (PtMyosin and PtRab5) were effectively inhibited. These results were further supported by the PO and lysozyme activities in hemolymph of the PtA2M-1- or PtA2M-2-silenced crabs. In addition, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 could regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (PtALF1-3, PtCrustin1 and PtCrustin3) through the Toll and NF-kappaB pathways. Our findings together suggest that PtA2Ms might function in crab host defense via regulating the proPO system, phagocytosis and the expression of AMP genes.</p></details></div>

This study focused on identifying the removal of two widely-used pesticides isoproturon (IPU) and acetochlor (ACT) by a genetically developed paddy (or rice) plant overexpressing an uncharacterized glycosyltransferase (IRGT1). IRGT1 conferred plant resistance to isoproturon/acetochlor, which was manifested by attenuated cellular injure and alleviated toxicity of rice growth under isoproturon/acetochlor stress. A short-term study showed that IRGT1-transformed lines removed 33.3-48.3% and 39.8-53.5% from the growth medium and remained only 59.5-72.1% and 58.9-70.4% isoproturon and acetochlor in plants compared to untransformed rice, respectively. This phenotype was well confirmed by IRGT1-expression in yeast (Pichia pastoris) which grew better and contained less isoproturon/acetochlor than control cells. A long-term study showed that isoproturon/acetochlor concentrations at all developmental stages were significantly lower in the transformed rice containing only 59.3-69.2% (isoproturon) and 51.7-57.4% (acetochlor) of those in wild-type. In contrast, UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that more isoproturon/acetochlor metabolites were detected in the transformed rice. Sixteen metabolites of isoproturon (19 for acetochlor) for Phase I reaction and 9 isoproturon conjugates (13 for acetochlor) for Phase II reaction in rice were characterized, of which 7 isoproturon and 6 isoproturon metabolites or conjugates were reported in plants for the first time.</p></details></div>

Exploration of alternatives production systems like as extracellular expression in microorganisms generally recognized as safe (such as Pichia pastoris Glycoswitch((R))) could be advantageous, in particular, if this system is able to produce homogeneous glycosylation. Here, we evaluated extracellular expression into Glycoswitch((R)) using two different strains constructions containing the asnB gene coding for Erwinia chrysanthemi L-ASNase (with and without His-tag), in order to find the best system for producing the extracellular and biologically active protein. When the His-tag was absent, both cell expression and protein secretion processes were considerably improved. Three-dimensional modeling of the protein suggests that additional structures (His-tag) could adversely affect native conformation and folding from L-ASNase and therefore the expression and cell secretion of this enzyme.</p></details></div>

The phospholipase D-mediated green synthesis of phosphatidylserine has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In this study, the phospholipase D was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. The highest activity of phospholipase D was observed in C. glutamicum, which was 0.25 U/mL higher than these in B. subtilis (0.14 U/mL) and P. pastoris (0.22 U/mL). System engineering of three potential factors, including (1) signal peptides, (2) ribosome binding site, and (3) promoters, was attempted to improve the expression level of phospholipase D in C. glutamicum. The maximum phospholipase D activity reached 1.9 U/mL, which was 7.6-fold higher than that of the initial level. The enzyme displayed favorable transphosphatidylation activity and it could efficiently catalyze the substrates L-serine and soybean lecithin for synthesis of phosphatidylserine after optimizing the conversion reactions in detail. Under the optimum conditions (trichloromethane/enzyme solution 4:2, 8 mg/mL soybean lecithin, 40 mg/mL L-serine, and 15 mM CaCl2, with shaking under 40 degrees C for 10 h), the reaction process showed 48.6% of conversion rate and 1.94 g/L of accumulated phosphatidylserine concentration. The results highlight the use of heterologous expression, system engineering, and process optimization strategies to adapt a promising phospholipase D for efficient phosphatidylserine production in synthetic application.</p></details></div>

In this study, the glycoside hydrolase family 45 (GH45) subfamily B endoglucanase EG27II from the snail Ampullaria crossean was expressed using a Pichia pastoris expression system and the crystal structure of the apo form was determined at 1.00 A resolution; this is the highest resolution structure of an animal endoglucanase. The results showed that EG27II has a double-psi six-stranded beta-barrel and that the structure of EG27II more closely resembles those of subfamily C enzymes than those of subfamily A enzymes. The structure of EG27II complexed with cellobiose was also determined under cryoconditions and at room temperature at three pH values, pH 4.0, 5.5 and 8.0, and no structural changes were found to be associated with the change in pH. The structural comparison and catalytic activity measurements showed that Asp137 and Asn112 function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively, and that Asp27 is also an important residue for catalysis. These high-resolution structures of EG27II provide a large amount of information for structure-based enzyme modification and cell-surface engineering, which will advance biofuel production using animal-derived cellulases.</p></details></div>

The expressed bovine IL-15 was purified by anion exchange chromatography and further characterized using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Biological activity of the purified protein was evaluated in vitro through induction of Bcl2 in IL-15 stimulated PBMCs was measured using qPCR and the phosphorylation of STAT3 was confirmed by immuno-staining of HEK273 cells. From the recent research studies, it was evident that the fatty acid oxidation catalyzed by Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1a (Cpt1a) is a critical step during the conversion of effector CD8(+) T cells to memory CD8(+) T cells which is induced by IL-15. There were no research studies revealed the role of IL-15 on activating memory CD8(+) T cells by influencing the Cpt1a in Bovines was documented; yet and in the present study, we evaluated that bovine IL-15 could induce the expression of Cpt1a in IL-15 treated bovine PBMCs and helps in memory cell induction.</p></details></div>

Thus, they can act on water-insoluble carboxylic esters releasing long-chain fatty acids but also on sterol esters, although with different activity and affinity. The differences in the catalytic properties among the proteins of this family are explained by small changes in the hydrophobicity of some regions. One of such versatile enzymes is the sterol esterase/lipase from Ophiostoma piceae (OPE) that acts very efficiently on the two types of substrates. Structurally, OPE is characterized by the presence of a lid formed by a alpha-helix and two 310-helices rich in hydrophobic amino acids. In this study, the ope gene was modified by directed mutagenesis in order to change specific amino acids in the lid region to modify its structure with the aim of increasing its hydrophobicity. Several recombinant forms of OPE were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. In silico molecular dynamics simulations have been used to decipher the mechanistic principles behind the improvements in substrate catalysis. The analyses suggested that the enhanced activity toward hydrophobic substrates such as triglycerides could be due to a better stabilization of the substrate in the lid region as a result of an increased hydrophobicity and an improved topology. These results indicate that in silico simulations can be useful for the optimization of the activity of lipases from the C. rugose-like family for different biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>

It has been challenging to develop a high performance alpha-galactosidase excelled on catalytic efficiency, thermostability, pH stability and protease-resistance that could efficiently hydrolyze RFOs. In this study, the first GH family 27 alpha-galactosidase gene from Irpex lacteus was cloned. The gene had an open reading frame of 1314bp interrupted by 12 introns. The recombinant alpha-galactosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris (rILgalA) had an apparent molecular mass of 64kDa and was highly N-glycosylated. rILgalA was maximally active at pH4.8 and 70 degrees C. It was stable over a broad pH range of 3-11, retained 90% of its activity after incubation at 60 degrees C for 10h and exhibited strong resistance to digestive proteases. Unlike many other alpha-galactosidases, rILgalA was hyperactive on RFOs. Its specific activities toward melibiose, raffinose and stachyose were 644, 755 and 833Umg(-1), respectively. The corresponding Kcat/Km values were 120, 130 and 180mM(-1)s(-1), which were the highest among reported alpha-galactosidases. rILgalA almost completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose in soymilk at 60 degrees C in 30min. These superior properties would make rILgalA an ideal remover of RFOs in food and feed industries.</p></details></div>

In mammals, p40 can be secreted as a monomer or homodimer and acts independently to mediate cellular responses. Recently, three p40 paralogues were isolated and identified from grass carp and other fish species, but whether they exist independently as well as their functional consequences and significance remain unclear. In the present study, using grass carp as the model, we for the first time demonstrated the existence of natural fish p40a, p40b and p40c (gcp40a, gcp40b and gcp40c) mainly as a monomer in culture supernatant of head kidney leukocytes (HKLs). Particularly, their excessive secretion induced by various immune stimuli suggests possible involvement of free p40s in fish immune responses. To define their functions, recombinant grass carp p40a/b/c (rgcp40a, rgcp40b and rgcp40c) were prepared by Pichia pastoris expression system, and they possessed the activities to enhance the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha) in grass carp HKLs. These pro-inflammatory properties of p40 isoforms prompted us to investigate their roles during the inflammatory process. In line with this, in vivo study revealed the pathogenic effect of rgcp40a on intestinal inflammation, whereas gcp40a polyclonal antibodies remarkably ameliorated Aeromonas hydrophila-induced intestinal histopathological changes. Taken together, our results uncover the biological significance of free p40s in teleost, and provide new clue for targeting fish intestinal inflammation.</p></details></div>

The complete cDNA of PtMBL gene was 1208 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 732 bp that encoded 244 amino acid proteins. PtMBL shared lower amino acid similarity with other MBLs, yet it contained the conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with QPD motif and was clearly member of the collectin family. PtMBL transcripts were mainly detected in eyestalk and gill with sexually dimorphic expression. The temporal expression of PtMBL in hemocytes showed different activation times after challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris. The recombinant PtMBL protein revealed antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It could also bind and agglutinate (Ca(2+)-dependent) both bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, the agglutinating activity could be inhibited by both d-galactose and d-mannose, suggesting the broader pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition spectrum of PtMBL.

To increase the potency of SAK and to minimize vessel reocclusion, a new construct bearing SAK motif fused to tsetse thrombin inhibitor (TTI) via a 20-amino acid linker with 2 RGD (2 x Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid inhibiting platelet aggregation via attachment to integrin receptors of platelet) was codon optimized and expressed comparatively in Pichia pastoris GS115 as a Mut(+) strain and KM71H as a Mut(s) strain. Fusion protein was optimized in terms of best expression condition and fibrinolytic activity and compared with the rSAK. Expression level of the designed construct reached up to 175 mg/L of the culture medium after 72-hr stimulation with 2.5% methanol and remained steady for 3-4 days. The highest expression was obtained at the range of 2-3% methanol. The SAK-2RGD-TT (relative activity > 82%) was more active at 25-37 degrees C than rSAK (relative activity of 93%). Further, it showed relative activity > 80% at pH ranges of 7-9. Western blot analysis showed two bands of nearly 27 and 24 kDa at ratio of 5 to 3, respectively. The specific fibrinolytic activity of the SAK-2RGD-TTI was measured as 8269 U/mg, and 19616 U/mg for the non-purified and purified proteins, respectively. Deglycosylation by using tunicamycin in culture medium resulted in higher fibrinolytic activity of SAK-2RGD-TTI (2.2 fold). Consequently, compared to the rSAK, at the same equimolar proportion, addition of RGD and TTI fragments could increase fibrinolytic activity. Also, P. pastoris can be considered as an efficient host for overexpression of the soluble SAK-2RGD-TTI with high activity without requiring a complicated purification procedure.

Here, we present a validation scheme including a comparison of different LC methods that allow for customization of analytical strategies for tracer studies with regard to the targeted metabolites. As the measurement of significant changes in labeling patterns depends on the spectral accuracy, we investigate this aspect comprehensively for high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry combined with reversed-phase chromatography, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, or anion-exchange chromatography. Moreover, we propose a quality control protocol based on (1) a metabolite containing selenium to assess the instrument performance and on (2) in vivo synthesized isotopically enriched Pichia pastoris to validate the accuracy of carbon isotopologue distributions (CIDs), in this case considering each isotopologue of a targeted metabolite panel. Finally, validation involved a thorough assessment of procedural blanks and matrix interferences. We compared the analytical figures of merit regarding CID determination for over 40 metabolites between the three methods. Excellent precisions of less than 1% and trueness bias as small as 0.01-1% were found for the majority of compounds, whereas the CID determination of a small fraction was affected by contaminants. For most compounds, changes of labeling pattern as low as 1% could be measured. Graphical abstract.</p></details></div>

Far UV CD structure analysis revealed major beta-sheet and minor alpha helical segments present in the Lcc1. A significant change in the spectrum of Lcc1, indicative of unfolding of secondary structures, was observed with increasing concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) during Trp fluorescence, absorption and CD measurements. A similar trend was also noticed for enzyme activity with respect to GdnHCl concentrations. To establish the role of copper ion in the catalytic activity of laccase, a complete removal of copper was carried out and addition of copper was found to restore the structure and activity during the refolding process. The apo form was also reconstituted by addition of zinc ion which restored nearly 84% of enzyme activity, indicating non-essential role of copper in maintaining conformation and activity.

Here, recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLf) expressed in Pichia pastoris was tested for its potential cytotoxic activity on a panel of six human breast cancer cell lines. The rhLf cytotoxic effect was determined via a live-cell HTS imaging assay. Also, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry protocols were employed to investigate the rhLf mode of action. The rhLf revealed an effective CC50 of 91.4 and 109.46 microg/ml on non-metastatic and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, with favorable selective cytotoxicity index values, 11.68 and 13.99, respectively. Moreover, rhLf displayed satisfactory SCI values on four additional cell lines, MDA-MB-468, HCC70, MCF-7 and T-47D (1.55-3.34). Also, rhLf provoked plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage in MDA-MB-231 cells, being all three apoptosis-related morphological changes. Also, rhLf was able to shrink the microfilaments, forming a punctuated cytoplasmic pattern in both the MDA-MB-231 and Hs-27 cells, as visualized in confocal photomicrographs. Moreover, performing flow cytometric analysis, rhLf provoked significant phosphatidylserine externalization, cell cycle arrest in the S phase and apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Hence, rhLf possesses selective cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells. Also, rhLf caused apoptosis-associated morphologic changes, disruption of F-actin cytoskeleton organization, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and arrest of the cell cycle progression on triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall results suggest that rhLf is using the apoptosis pathway as its mechanism to inflict cell death.

This nontraditional substrate can be widely produced from syngas via hydrolysis or pyrolysis of the cellulosic biomass, chemical or microbial catalysis, anaerobic fermentation in treated wastewater, etc. However, the toxicity of acetate to microorganisms has held back its utilization, especially for the eukaryotes that are good hosts for production of complicated pharmaceuticals or chemicals. This study seeks to improve acetate utilization in a widely used yeast host, Komagataella phaffii (previously Pichia pastoris), by metabolic engineering of acetate tolerance, transport, and metabolism. Results: A kinase-deficient library of K. phaffii was firstly used to screen acetate-resistant kinases. The HRK1 knockout strain was sensitive to acetate and overexpression of this gene improved acetate tolerance and cell growth of the strain. Also, overexpression of HRK1 caused a 55% productivity improvement of acetyl-CoA-dependent 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA). However, activation of Hrk1 on membrane H(+)-ATPase Pma1 seemed not to work in the engineered strain. Acetate transporter gene ScFPS1* was further overexpressed, despite of not improving 6-MSA biosynthesis. To enhance acetate metabolism, acetyl-CoA synthesizing related genes, yeast PpACS1, ScACS1*, and E. coli ackA/pta were overexpressed separately. Introduction of PpACS1 and ScACS1* each increased biosynthesis of 6-MSA by approximately 20% on 20 mM acetate. Finally, co-overexpression of HRK1 and ScACS1* improved 6-MSA productivity by 51% on 20 mM acetate, despite that a low expression level of HRK1 happened when genes were expressed under the same promoter. Conclusions: HRK1 screened by K. phaffii kinase-deficient library played an important role in acetate tolerance and was proved to profit the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. It could be a potential target for metabolic engineering of acetate utilization in other eukaryotic hosts as well. A combined strategy of introducing genes for acetate tolerance and metabolism further improved biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA derived reporter compound in K. phaffii. This makes it a good choice for acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals with acetate as substrate or precursor in K. phaffii, which would also extend the use of this chassis host.</p></details></div>

However, practical implementation of hydrophobins at large scale has been hindered by low recombinant yields. In this study, the effects of increasing hydrophobin gene copy number and overexpressing endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone proteins Kar2p, Pdi1p, and Ero1p were explored as a means to enhance recombinant yields of the class II hydrophobin HFBI in the eukaryotic expression host Pichia pastoris. One-, 2-, and 3-copy-HFBI strains were attained using an in vitro multimer ligation approach, with strains displaying copy number stability following subsequent transformations as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Increasing HFBI copy number alone had no effect on increasing HFBI secretion, but increasing copy number in concert with chaperone overexpression synergistically increased HFBI secretion. Overexpression of PDI1 or ERO1 caused insignificant changes in HFBI secretion in 1- and 2-copy strains, but a statistically significant HFBI secretion increase in 3-copy strain. KAR2 overexpression consistently resulted in enhanced HFBI secretion in all copy number strains, with 3-copy-HFBI secreting 22+/-1.6 fold more than the 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. The highest increase was seen in 3-copy-HFBI/Ero1p overexpressing strain with 30+/-4.0 fold increase in HFBI secretion over 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. This corresponded to an expression level of approximately 330 mg/L HFBI in the 5 ml small-scale format used in this study.</p></details></div>

In this study, volumetric mass transfer (kLa) and volumetric gassed power input (Pg/V) were evaluated within values attainable in large-scale production as scale-up criteria for recombinant dextranase production by Mut(S) P. pastoris strain. Cultures were oxygen limited when the volumetric gassed power supply was limited to 2 kW m(-3). Specific growth rate, and then dextranase production, increased as kLa and Pg/V did. Meanwhile, specific production and methanol consumption rates were constant, due to the limited methanol condition also achieved at 2 L bioprocesses. The specific dextranase production rate was two times higher than the values previously reported for a Mut(+) strain. After a scale-up process, at constant kLa, the specific growth rate was kept at 30 L bioprocess, whereas dextranase production decreased, due to the effect of methanol accumulation. Results obtained at 30 L bioprocesses suggest that even under oxygen-limited conditions, methanol saturated conditions are not adequate to express dextranase with the promoter alcohol oxidase. Bioprocesses developed within feasible and scalable operational conditions are of high interest for the commercial production of recombinant proteins from Pichia pastoris.</p></details></div>

Efficient enzymatic systems are needed to degrade the plant cell wall and overcome its recalcitrance. A widely used producer of cellulolytic cocktails is the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei, but this organism secretes a limited set of enzymes. To improve the saccharification yields, one strategy is to upgrade the T. reesei enzyme cocktail with enzymes produced by other biomass-degrading filamentous fungi isolated from biodiversity. Results: In this study, the enzymatic cocktails secreted by five strains from the genus Aspergillus (Aspergillus japonicus strains BRFM 405, 1487, 1489, 1490 and Aspergillus niger strain BRFM 430) were tested for their ability to boost a T. reesei reference cocktail for the saccharification of pretreated biomass. Proteomic analysis of fungal secretomes that significantly improved biomass degradation showed that the presence of proteins belonging to a putative LPMO family previously identified by genome analysis and awaiting experimental demonstration of activity. Members of this novel LPMO family, named AA16, are encountered in fungi and oomycetes with life styles oriented toward interactions with plant biomass. One AA16 protein from Aspergillus aculeatus (AaAA16) was produced to high level in Pichia pastoris. LPMO-type enzyme activity was demonstrated on cellulose with oxidative cleavage at the C1 position of the glucose unit. AaAA16 LPMO was found to significantly improve the activity of T. reesei CBHI on cellulosic substrates. Conclusions: Although Aspergillus spp. has been investigated for decades for their CAZymes diversity, we identified members of a new fungal LPMO family using secretomics and functional assays. Properties of the founding member of the AA16 family characterized herein could be of interest for use in biorefineries.</p></details></div>

MSTN inhibition by myostatin propeptide (MSPP) increased skeletal muscle mass, myofiber growth and muscle force. Thus, this study was designed to produce wild-type porcine MSPP (WT-MSPP) and its mutated form (D75A-MSPP) in yeast Pichia pastoris and to investigate its potential enhancement of myoblast growth and differentiation. In an in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP (10mug/mL) in either a regular culture medium or in a differentiation medium for 72h. In an animal trial, post-weaning C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were administered WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP for 6weeks. The results showed that C2C12 myoblasts treated with the purified WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP could dramatically promote cell proliferation. Both myoD and myogenin were significantly increased (p<.05) after WT-MSPP or D75A-MSPP treatment. D75A-MSPP was particularly more effective than WT-MSPP in promoting myotube formation (p<.05). The post-weaning mice treated with D75A-MSPP significantly increased both body and muscle weights compared with the mock and WT-MSPP groups (p<.05). Furthermore, the mice treatment with D75A-MSPP could prevent increased glucose injection from inducing glucose elevation. Our data indicated that a mutant-type MSPP (D75A-MSPP) was superior to WT-MSPP in effectively enhancing myofiber growth due to the highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage by the bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid (BMP-1/TLD) and thus has potential applications for clinical muscle wasting diseases or for increasing muscle mass in meat-producing animals.</p></details></div>

The beta-galactosidases from bacteria, especially lactobacilli, and yeast have neutral pH and are much more likely to be developed as food additives. However, the challenges of cumbersome purification, product toxicity, and low yield in protein production have limited the commercialization of many excellent candidates. In this study, we identified a beta-galactosidase gene (bg42-106) in Bifidobacterium animalis ACCC05790 and expressed the gene product in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris GS115, respectively. The recombinant bG42-106 purified from E. coli cells was found to be optimally active at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C and had excellent stability over a wide pH range (5.0-8.0) and at high temperature (60 degrees C). The specific activity of bG42-106 reached up to 2351 U/mg under optimal conditions. The galacto-oligosaccharide yield was 24.45 g/L after incubation with bG42-106 at 60 degrees C for 2 h. When recombinant bG42-106 was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, it was found in the culture medium but only at a concentration of 1.73 U/ml. To increase its production, three strategies were employed, including codon optimization, disulfide formation, and fusion with a Cherry tag, with Cherry-tag fusion being most effective. The culture medium of P. pastoris that expressed Cherry-tagged bG42-106 contained 24.4 U/mL of beta-galactosidase activity, which is 14-fold greater than that produced by culture of P. pastoris harboring wild-type bG42-106.</p></details></div>

The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-beta-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs and similarly to expansins, FgCPPs are trapped by cellulose and not by chitin, thus suggesting that these proteins interact with cellulose. A double knock-out mutant deleted of both FgCPPs encoding genes produces much more cellulase activity than the corresponding wild type strain when grown on CMC, likely compensating the absence of FgCPPs. This result prompted us to investigate a possible synergistic effect of these proteins with fungal cellulases. The incubation of FgCPPs in the presence of a fungal cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) determines an increased enzymatic activity on CMC, filter paper and wheat cell walls. The observation that FgCPPs act with a non-hydrolytic mechanism indicates that these proteins favor fungal cellulase activity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections.</p></details></div>

However, pIFN-gamma is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-gamma in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-gamma protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-gamma protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-gamma gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-gamma gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-gamma gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-gamma protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0-24 h at 28 degrees C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24-72 h at 25 degrees C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO.

Methanol induction however poses several drawbacks. One approach to improve processes is to use MutS strains with reduced methanol catabolic ability. Various reports claim that MutS allows higher recombinant protein production levels than Mut+, but scarcely elaborate on reasons for differences. In this study, EGFP was used as a PAOX1 -driven reporter for the investigation of expression differences between Mut+ and MutS strains. Mut+ exhibited higher responses to methanol, with faster growth (0.07 vs 0.01 h(-1) ) and higher consumption of methanol (2.25 vs 1.81 mmol.(gDCW .h)(-1) ) and oxygen (2.2 vs 0.66 mmol.(gDCW .h)(-1) ) than MutS. Mut+ yielded more biomass than MutS (2.3 vs 1.3 gDCW .L(-1) ), and carbon dioxide analysis of bioreactor off-gas suggested that considerable amounts of methanol were consumed by Mut+ via the dissimilatory pathway. In contrast, it was demonstrated that the MutS population switched to an induced state more rapidly than Mut+. In addition, MutS exhibited 3.4-fold higher fluorescence levels per cell, (77 509 vs 23 783 SFU), indicative of higher recombinant protein production. The findings were verified by similar results obtained during the expression of a lipase. Based on differences in response to methanol versus recombinant protein production, it was proposed that higher energy availability occurs in MutS for recombinant protein synthesis, contrary to Mut+ that uses the energy to maintain high levels of methanol catabolic pathways and biomass production.</p></details></div>

Here, we show that an evolutionary transition from covalent conjugation to non-covalent interaction has occurred in the ubiquitin-like autophagy-related 12 (ATG12) conjugation system. ATG12 is covalently conjugated to its sole substrate, ATG5, by a ubiquitylation-like mechanism. However, the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium and Toxoplasma and some yeast species such as Komagataella phaffii (previously Pichia pastoris) lack the E2-like enzyme ATG10 and the most carboxy (C)-terminal glycine of ATG12, both of which are required for covalent linkage. Instead, ATG12 in these organisms forms a non-covalent complex with ATG5. This non-covalent ATG12-ATG5 complex retains the ability to facilitate ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation. These results suggest that ubiquitin-like covalent conjugation can evolve to a simpler non-covalent interaction, most probably when the system has a limited number of targets.</p></details></div>

To obtain enzymes with enhanced catalytic efficiency (pH5.5) and excellent activity in acidic pH range, we performed structure-based rational design of a thermostable phytase (PhyAn). For this, six mutants based on different rational design strategies were constructed and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Particularly, the extracellular enzymatic activity was assessed to ensure that the produced enzymes met requirements of further analyses. Several positive mutants with enhanced catalytic efficiency or pH-profile shifts were carefully examined. Biochemical and kinetic investigations of purified mutants revealed that E79K, E80K, E79K+E80K and D68K had higher catalytic efficiency than the parent enzyme by approximately 49%, 67%, 86% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, the optimum pH of mutant Y65H was shifted from 5.0 to 3.0, and the peak of D68K shifted to pH5.5. Analysis of the structural-functional relationships revealed that changes in amino acid charges, structural flexibility and space hindrance could significantly influence certain enzyme characteristics. Our results illustrate the feasibility and present a structural foundation for enhancing the phytase-catalytic efficiency and acid resistance by assembling mutations derived using rational design.</p></details></div>

To produce significant amounts of Hispidalin, a recombinant Hispidalin with an N-terminal 6xHis tag and an enterokinase sequence, for the first time, was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris cell factory. Results showed that the E. coli-derived recombinant Hispidalin did not show any antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains, whereas the P. pastoris-derived recombinant Hispidalin (rHispidalin) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against five pathogenic bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. rHispidalin also has bactericidal activity and completely killed all of the Staphylococcus aureus within 40min. Additionally, rHispidalin showed a broad range of thermostability and pH stability, and a hemolytic activity of less than 2% even at a concentration of 300mug/ml; it was resistant to trypsin and proteinase K, but was moderately sensitive to pepsin and papain. Moreover, rHispidalin effectively permeabilized the cytoplasmic membrane and disrupted the morphology of targeted bacterial cells. After an initial optimization was performed, the amount of rHispidalin accumulation could reach as high as 98.6mug/ml. These results indicate that Hispidalin could be produced on a large scale by P. pastoris and has a great potential to be utilized as a new antibacterial agent for further development.</p></details></div>

These are proteins, typically with repetitive amino acid sequences, that have such physical properties that they can be used as functional materials. Well-known natural examples are collagen, silk, and elastin, but also artificial sequences have been devised. These proteins can be produced in a suitable host via recombinant DNA technology, and it is this inherent control over monomer sequence and molecular size that renders this class of polymers of particular interest to the fields of nanomaterials and biomedical research. Traditionally, Escherichia coli has been the main workhorse for the production of these polymers, but the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is finding increased use in view of the often high yields and potential bioprocessing benefits. We here provide an overview of protein-based polymers produced in P. pastoris. We summarize their physicochemical properties, briefly note possible applications, and detail their biosynthesis. Some challenges that may be faced when using P. pastoris for polymer production are identified: (i) low yields and poor process control in shake flask cultures; i.e., the need for bioreactors, (ii) proteolytic degradation, and (iii) self-assembly in vivo. Strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed, which we anticipate will be of interest also to readers involved in protein expression in P. pastoris in general.</p></details></div>

ChSase AC II, with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa and a specific activity of 18.7 U/mg, showed the highest activity at 37 degrees C and pH 6.5 and maintained stability at a broad range of pH (5(-)7.5) and temperature (below 35 degrees C). The enzyme activity was increased in the presence of Mn(2+) and was strongly inhibited by Hg(2+). Moreover, the kinetic parameters of ChSase AC II against CS-A, CS-C, and HA were determined. TLC and ESI-MS analysis of the degradation products indicated that ChSase AC II displayed an exolytic action mode and completely hydrolyzed three substrates into oligosaccharides with low degrees of polymerization (DPs).

In this research, FOS produced by BfrA were characterized by HPAE-PAD analysis as a mixture of 1-kestotriose, 6(G)-kestotriose (neokestose), and to a major extent 6-kestotriose. In order to increase the FOS yield, three BfrA mutants (W14Y, W14Y-N16S and W14Y-W256Y), designed from sequence divergence between hydrolases and transferases, were constructed and constitutively expressed in the non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant glycoproteins were purified and characterized. The three mutants synthesized 6-kestotriose as the major component of a FOS mixture that includes minor amounts of tetra- and pentasaccharides. In all cases, sucrose hydrolysis was the predominant reaction. All mutants reached a similar overall FOS yield, with the average value 37.6% (w/w) being 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (12.6%, w/w). None of the mutations altered the enzyme thermophilicity and thermostability. The single mutant W14Y, with specific activity of 841 U mg(-1), represents an attractive candidate for the continuous production of FOS-containing invert syrup at pasteurization temperatures.</p></details></div>

Due solely to their presence in the Wsc-family proteins working as a plasma membrane sensor for surface stress and in a fungal beta-1,3-exoglucanse, WSC domains have been presumed to possess carbohydrate-binding property without any experimental evidence. Aiming at elucidation of function(s) of WSC domains, we characterized a WSC domain-containing alcohol oxidase from the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (PoAlcOX). Recombinant PoAlcOX produced with Pichia pastoris showed alcohol oxidase activity toward a wide range of substrates including two aliphatic alcohols, a branched-chain alcohol, a diol, and a polyol. Deletion of the WSC domain virtually unaffected oxidation of these substrates by PoAlcOX, indicating that the domain makes no contribution to the catalytic activity. In analogy to some carbohydrate-binding modules, we inferred that the WSC domain plays a role in protein anchoring, and evaluated binding capability of PoAlcOX to a set of polysaccharide components of fungal and plant cell walls. This revealed that PoAlcOX binds to xylans and fungal chitin/beta-1,3-glucan in the WSC domain-dependent manner, demonstrating for the first time the carbohydrate-binding property of the domain. Additionally, we provide evidence that PoAlcOX immobilized on birch wood xylan retains the catalytic activity. Overall, the data we collected suggest that the role of the WSC domain of PoAlcOX is not recognition of substrates but attaching the enzyme to plant and/or fungal cell wall.</p></details></div>

In this sense, nonpungent capsaicin analogues as olvanil are a feasible alternative to the unpleasant sensations produced by capsaicin while maintaining a similar pharmacological profile. Olvanil can be obtained by a lipase-catalyzed chemoenzymatic process. In the present work, recombinant Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and subsequently immobilized by cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) methodology for the synthesis of olvanil. The CALB-CLEAs were obtained directly from the fermentation broth of P. pastoris without any purification step in order to assess the role of the contaminant proteins of the crude extract as co-feeders. The CALB-CLEAs were also bioimprinted to enhance the catalytic performance in olvanil synthesis. When CALB was precipitated with isopropanol, the obtained CALB-CLEAs exhibited the highest activity in the synthesis of olvanil, regardless of the glutaraldehyde concentration. The maximum product synthesis was found at 72 hr obtaining 6.8 g L(-1) of olvanil with a reaction yield of 16%. When CALB was bioimprinted with olvanil, the synthesis was enhanced 1.3 times, reaching 10.7 g L(-1) of olvanil at 72 hr of reaction with a reaction yield of 25%. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated different morphologies of the CLEAs depending on the precipitating agent and the template used for bioimprinting. Recombinant CALB-CLEAs obtained directly from the fermentation broth are a suitable alternative to commercial enzymatic preparations for the synthesis of olvanil in organic medium.</p></details></div>

However, obtaining sufficient amounts of millipedes is difficult, and the production of the Chamberlinius hualienensis HNL (ChuaHNL) in E. coli has not been very successful. Therefore, we investigated the conditions required for high-yield heterologous production of this enzyme using Pichia pastoris. When we employed P. pastoris to express His-ChuaHNL, the yield was very low (22.6 +/- 3.8 U/L culture). Hence, we investigated the effects of ChuaHNL codon optimization and the co-production of two protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) [from P. pastoris (PpPDI) and C. hualienensis (ChuaPDI1, ChuaPDI2)] on His-ChuaHNL production. The productivity of His-ChuaHNL was increased approximately 140 times per unit culture to 3170 +/- 144.7 U/L by the co-expression of codon-optimized ChuaHNL and PpPDI. Moreover, we revealed that the N-glycosylation on ChuaHNL had a large effect on the stability, enzyme secretion, and catalytic properties of ChuaHNL in P. pastoris. This study demonstrates an economical and efficient approach for the production of HNL, and the data show that glycosylation has a large effect on the enzyme properties and the P. pastoris expression system.</p></details></div>

Due to the high rate of protein production, incorrectly folded proteins may accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To restore their proper folding, the cell triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR); however, if the proteins cannot be repaired, they are degraded, which impairs process productivity. Moreover, a non-producing/non-secreting subpopulation of cells might occur, which also decreases overall productivity. Therefore, an in depth understanding of intracellular protein fluxes and population heterogeneity is needed to improve productivity. Under industrially relevant cultivation conditions in bioreactors, we cultured P. pastoris strains producing three different recombinant proteins: penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli (EcPGA), lipase B from Candida antarctica (CaLB) and xylanase A from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TlXynA). Extracellular and intracellular product concentrations were determined, along with flow cytometry-based single-cell measurements of cell viability and the up-regulation of UPR. The cell population was distributed into four clusters, two of which were viable cells with no UPR up-regulation, differing in cell size and complexity. The other two clusters were cells with impaired viability, and cells with up-regulated UPR. Over the time course of cultivation, the distribution of the population into these four clusters changed. After 30 h of production, 60% of the cells producing EcPGA, which accumulated in the cells (50-70% of the product), had up-regulated UPR, but only 13% of the cells had impaired viability. A higher proportion of cells with decreased viability was observed in strains producing CaLB (20%) and TlXynA (27%). The proportion of cells with up-regulated UPR in CaLB-producing (35%) and TlXynA-producing (30%) strains was lower in comparison to the EcPGA-producing strain, and a smaller proportion of CaLB and TlXynA (<10%) accumulated in the cells. These data provide an insight into the development of heterogeneity in a recombinant P. pastoris population during a biotechnological process. A deeper understanding of the relationship between protein production/secretion and the regulation of the UPR might be utilized in bioprocess control and optimization with respect to secretion and population heterogeneity.</p></details></div>

The overexpression of PLD in a recombinant strain is necessary to achieve large-scale PLD production. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of expressing PLD from Streptomyces halstedii in different hosts. The enzymatic activity of PLD reached 69.12 U/mL in the homologous Streptomyces lividans host, which was around 50-fold higher than that in the original host. Meanwhile, in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, PLD expression was poor and showed obvious toxicity to cells, which may have been one of the reasons for low levels of PLD observed in heterologous hosts. An induced (Ptip)/constitutive (PermE*) dual-promoter expression system in S. lividans was constructed, which could achieve constitutive expression with PLD enzymatic activity of 13.41 U/mL under non-induced conditions and yield the highest PLD enzymatic activity of 68.33 U/mL with 2 mug/mL thiostreptone. The concentration of the expensive inducer was significantly reduced to only 10% of that used in the original expression system without affecting the protein expression level, which provided a good foundation for subsequent industrial applications to reduce production costs.</p></details></div>
