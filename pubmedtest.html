Although most of the variants were still cleaved by trypsin, some of them did show an evident increase of resistance against proteolytic degradation. The most stable mutant was LIP2-C5, in which five trypsin-cleavage sites were replaced by non-preferred amino acids. Upon incubation with human trypsin for 80 min at 37 degrees C, the mutant LIP2-C5 was found to retain >70% of its initial activity, compared to only 10% for the wild-type.</p></details></div>

However, it is unstable and volatile in vitro. It needs to be encapsulated in liposomes when feeding livestock, whose high cost greatly limits its application in pig industry. Therefore we attempted to express pGH as intracellular soluble protein in Pichia pastoris and feed these yeasts with partial wall-breaking for swine, which could release directly pGH in intestine tract in case of being degraded in intestinal tract with low cost. In order to improve the intracellular soluble expression of pGH protein in Pichia pastoris and stability in vitro, we optimized the pGH gene, and screened molecular chaperones from E. coli and Pichia pastoris respectively for co-expressing with pGH. In addition, we had also explored conditions of mechanical crushing and fermentation. The results showed that the expression of intracellular soluble pGH protein was significantly increased after gene optimized and co-expressed with Ssa1-Sis1 chaperone from Pichia pastoris. Meanwhile, the optimal conditions of partial wall-breaking and fermentation of Pichia pastoris were confirmed, the data showed that the intracellular expression of the optimized pGH protein co-expressed with Ssa1-Sis1 could reach 340 mg/L with optimal conditions of partial wall-breaking and fermentation. Animal experiments verified that the optimized pGH protein co-expression with Ssa1-Sis1 had the best promoting effects on the growth of piglets. Our study demonstrated that Ssa1-Sis1 could enhance the intracellular soluble expression of pGH protein in Pichia pastoris and that partial wall-breaking of yeast could prevent pGH from degradation in vitro, release targetedly in the intestine and play its biological function effectively. Our study could provide a new idea to cut the cost effectively, establishing a theoretical basis for the clinic application of unstable substances in vitro.</p></details></div>

ZEN degrading enzymes possess the potential for counteracting the negative effect of ZEN and its associated high safety risk in corn oil. Herein, we targeted enhancing the secretion of ZEN degrading enzyme by Pichia pastoris through constructing an expression plasmid containing three optimized expression cassettes of zlhy-6 codon and signal peptides. Further, we explored various parameters of enzymatic detoxification in neutralized oil and analyzed tocopherols and sterols losses in the corn oil. In addition, the distribution of degraded products was demonstrated as well by Agilent 6510 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry. P. pastoris GSZ with the glucoamylase signal was observed with the highest ZLHY-6 secretion yield of 0.39 mg/mL. During the refining of corn oil, ZEN in the crude oil was reduced from 1257.3 to 13 microg/kg (3.69% residual) after neutralization and enzymatic detoxification. Compared with the neutralized oil, no significant difference in the total tocopherols and sterols contents was detected after enzymatic detoxification. Finally, the degraded products were found to be entirely eliminated by washing. This study presents an enzymatic strategy for efficient and safe ZEN removal with relatively low nutrient loss, which provides an important basis for further application of enzymatic ZEN elimination in the industrial process of corn oil production.</p></details></div>

The study of ORIs is essential for understanding the cell-division cycle and gene expression regulation. Accurate identification of ORIs will provide important clues for DNA replication research and drug development by developing computational methods. In this paper, the first integrated predictor named iORI-Euk was built to identify ORIs in multiple eukaryotes and multiple cell types. In the predictor, seven eukaryotic (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Pichia pastoris, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Kluyveromyces lactis) ORI data was collected from public database to construct benchmark datasets. Subsequently, three feature extraction strategies which are k-mer, binary encoding and combination of k-mer and binary were used to formulate DNA sequence samples. We also compared the different classification algorithms' performance. As a result, the best results were obtained by using support vector machine in 5-fold cross-validation test and independent dataset test. Based on the optimal model, an online web server called iORI-Euk (http://lin-group.cn/server/iORI-Euk/) was established for the novel ORI identification.</p></details></div>

Nowadays, different expression systems are used for the production of recombinant proteins including bacteria, yeasts, molds, mammals, plants, and insects. Yeast expression systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) are more popular. P. pastoris expression system is one of the most popular and standard tools for the production of recombinant protein in molecular biology. Overall, the benefits of protein production by P. pastoris system include appropriate folding (in the endoplasmic reticulum) and secretion (by Kex2 as signal peptidase) of recombinant proteins to the external environment of the cell. Moreover, in the P. pastoris expression system due to its limited production of endogenous secretory proteins, the purification of recombinant protein is easy. It is also considered a unique host for the expression of subunit vaccines which could significantly affect the growing market of medical biotechnology. Although P. pastoris expression systems are impressive and easy to use with well-defined process protocols, some degree of process optimization is required to achieve maximum production of the target proteins. Methanol and sorbitol concentration, Mut forms, temperature and incubation time have to be adjusted to obtain optimal conditions, which might vary among different strains and externally expressed protein. Eventually, optimal conditions for the production of a recombinant protein in P. pastoris expression system differ according to the target protein.</p></details></div>

Our aim was to explore a cost-effective application of camelid anti-PCSK9 single domain antibodies (sdAbs), which are high variable regions of the camelid heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), as a human PCSK9 (hPCSK9) inhibitor. One female llama was immunized with hPCSK9. Screening of high affinity anti-PCSK9 VHHs was carried out based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. We reported a lysate kinetic analysis method improving the screening efficiency. To increase the serum half-life and targeting properties, the constant region fragment of the human immunoglobulin gamma sub-type 4 (IgG4 Fc) was incorporated to form a novel llama-human chimeric molecule (VHH-hFc).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The PCSK9 inhibiting effects of the VHH proteins were analyzed in two human liver hepatocellular cells (HepG2 and Huh7) and in the hPCSK9 transgenic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model. The hPCSK9 antagonistic potency of the bivalent VHH-hFc exceeded the monovalent VHH (P < 0.001) in hepatocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, the llama-human chimeric VHH-Fc protein had a similar reduction (~ 40%) of the LDL-c and total cholesterol when compared to the approved evolocumab in transgenic SD rat model, but with low cost. More surprisingly, the chimeric heavy chain antibodies could be persevered for 3 months at room temperature with little loss of the affinity.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Due to the high yield and low cost of Pichia pastoris, lipid-lowering effect and strong stability, the llama-human chimeric antibody (VHH-Fc) offers a potent therapeutic candidate for the control of the serum lipid level.</p></details></div>

Plasmids containing single guide RNA and the methanol expression regulator 1 (MXR1) homology arms were used to precisely edit the transcriptional activator Mxr1 on the P. pastoris genome. At the S215 amino acid position of Mxr1, one, two, and three nucleotides were precisely deleted or inserted, and S215 was also mutated to S215A via a single-base substitution. Sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons in the region spanning MXR1 showed that CRISPR/Cas9 technology enabled efficient and precise gene editing of P. pastoris. The expression levels of several of the Mxr1-targeted genes, AOX1, AOX2, DAS1, and DAS2, in strains containing the various mutated variants of MXR1, were then detected through reverse transcription PCR following induction in methanol-containing culture medium. The frameshift mutations of Mxr1 led to almost zero transcription of AOX1, DAS1, and DAS2, while that of AOX2 was reduced to 60%. For the Mxr1 S215A mutant, the transcription of AOX1, AOX2, DAS1, and DAS2 was also reduced by nearly 60%. Based on these results, it is apparent that the transcription of AOX1, DAS1, and DAS2 is exclusively regulated by Mxr1 and serine phosphorylation at Mxr1 residue 215 is not critical for this function. In contrast, the transcription of AOX2 is mainly dependent on the phosphorylation of this residue. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was, therefore, successfully applied to the targeted editing of MXR1 on the P. pastoris genome, and it provided an effective method for the study of this transcription factor and its targets.</p></details></div>

In the present study, one novel galectin-1 protein named AjGal-1 was identified from Apostichopus japonicas with an open reading frame of 1179 bp encoding a polypeptide of 392 amino acids. The deduced amino acids sequence of AjGal-1 contained three carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) which shared 34-37% identity with that of other galectin proteins from echinodermata, fishes, and birds. In the phylogenetic tree, AjGal-1 was closely clustered with galectins from Mesocentrotus nudus and Paracentrotus lividus. The mRNA transcripts of AjGal-1 were ubiquitously expressed in all the detected tissues, including gut, longitudinal muscle, gonad, coelomocytes, respiratory tree, tentacle and body wall, with the highest expression level in coelomocytes. After Vibrio splendidus stimulation, the mRNA expression levels of AjGal-1 in coelomocytes were significantly increased at 6 and 12 h (P < 0.01) compared with that in control group, and went back to normal level at 72 h. The recombinant protein of AjGal-1 (rAjGal-1) could bind various PAMPs including d-galactose, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) and mannose (Man), and exhibited the highest affinity to d-galactose. Meanwhile, rAjGal-1 could also bind and agglutinate different kinds of microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (V. splendidus and Escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (Micrococus leteus), and fungi (Pichia pastoris). rAjGal-1 also exhibited anti-microbial activity against V. splendidus and E. coli. All these results suggested that AjGal-1 could function as an important PRR with broad spectrum of microbial recognition and anti-microbial activity against the invading pathogen in A. japonicas.</p></details></div>

Interestingly, the recombinant endoglucanase I (ReEG I) showed the catalytic activity towards both cellulose and xylan hydrolysis, yet it was more efficient with xylans. Among various glucans and xylans substrates (paper pulp, carboxymethylated cellulose, oat spelt xylan, birchwood xylan), birchwood xylan displayed a higher yield of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) (69.5 % after optimization). Eventually, it was observed that ReEG I could simultaneously produce XOS and COS, when the alkali-extracted corncob residues were used as substrate.

However, because NDHase is a membrane protein with three subunits (ndhS, ndhL and ndhM), it is difficult to express the enzyme in a functional form using common hosts such as Escherichia coli, Bacilus subtilis or Pichia pastoris. Furthermore, the enzyme requires special electron transfer chains in the membrane system for proper catalytic activity. Thus, we investigated the expression of NDHase in non-model bacterial strains, which are evolutionarily similar to C. testosteroni JA1, using several broad-host plasmids with different copy numbers as expression vectors. We successfully expressed NDHase in soluble from using the pVLT33 vector in C. testosteroni CNB-2, and found the activity of enzyme to be 40.6 U/L. To further improve the expression of NDHase in C. testosteroni CNB-2, we trialed a T7-like MmP1 system, composed of MmP1 RNA polymerase and an MmP1 promoter, which is used for transcriptional control in non-model bacteria. This increased protein expression and enzyme activity doubled to 90.5 U/L. A molecular chaperone was co-expressed using pBBR1MCS-5 in the same host to improve the efficiency of folding and assembly of multi-subunit structures. The maximum activity was 115 U/L using the molecular chaperone GroES-EL, far surpassing the previously reported level, although expression was almost equivalent. These results indicate that a strategy involving the construction of a T7-like system and co-expression of a molecular chaperone offers an efficient approach for heterologous expression of enzymes that are difficult to express in functional forms using conventional hosts.</p></details></div>

We assessed the Mut(-) phenotype for secreted recombinant protein production. The methanol inducible AOX1 promoter (PAOX1 ) was active in the Mut(-) phenotype and showed adequate eGFP fluorescence levels and protein yields (YP/X ) in small scale screenings. Different bioreactor cultivation scenarios with methanol excess concentrations were tested using PAOX1 HSA and PAOX1 vHH expression constructs. Scenario B composed of a glucose-methanol phase and a 72 hour long methanol only phase was the best performing, producing 531 mg.L(-1) HSA and 1631 mg.L(-1) vHH. 61% of the HSA was produced in the methanol only phase where no biomass growth was observed, representing a special case of growth independent production. By using the Mut(-) phenotype the oxygen demand, heat output and specific methanol uptake (qmethanol ) in the methanol phase were reduced by more than 80% compared to the Mut(S) phenotype.

We adopted systems metabolic engineering strategies to improve SAM production in a high-producing strain (GS115/DS56). First, the cystathionine beta-synthase gene CYS4 was downregulated using a weak promoter PG12 to reduce the removal of homocysteine from SAM cycle, thus leading to a 48.8% increase in the SAM titer (1.68 g/L) from the strain G12-CBS, while preventing cysteine auxotrophy induced by deletion of this essential gene. Subsequently, the SAM titer of G12-CBS was improved to 13.01 g/L in 15-L fed-batch fermentation using the optimal l-methionine feeding strategy. Finally, based on comparative transcriptomics, five genes were chosen and overexpressed for further enhancement of SAM production. Among them, GDH2 and ACS2 exhibited positive effects, and the additional overexpression of GDH2 led to a 52.3% increase of titer (2.71 g/L) in shake flask culture. Therefore, the engineered Pichia pastoris strains can be utilized in industrial production of SAM using a simple and cost-effective process, and these approaches could be employed for improving the production of other chemicals by P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

However, the nitrilase expressed in E. coli has several drawbacks such as a low level of reusability, which hampered its industrial application. Herein, we investigated the potential of using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) for producing the nitrilase whole cell catalyst. To achieve strains with high catalytic activities, we investigated the effects of the promoter choice, expressing cassette copy number, and co-expression of chaperone on the production of nitrilase. Our results demonstrated that the strain harboring the multicopy integrations of nitrilase gene under the control of the alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and co-expressing of ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1) exhibited an 18-fold enhancement in the nitrilase activity compared with the strain containing a single integration of nitrilase gene under the control of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) dehydrogenase promoter.

Nevertheless, a direct comparison of the two systems for rProt production and secretion was lacking. This study therefore aimed to directly compare Y. lipolytica and P. pastoris for the production and secretion of lipase CalB in bioreactor. Y. lipolytica produced more than double the biomass and more than 5-fold higher extracellular lipase than P. pastoris. Furthermore, maximal CalB production levels were reached by Y. lipolytica in half the cultivation time required for maximal production by P. pastoris. Conversely, P. pastoris was found to express 7-fold higher levels of CalB mRNA. Secreted enhanced green fluorescent protein -in isolation and fused to CalB- and protease inhibitor MG-132 were used in P. pastoris to further investigate the reasons behind such discrepancy. The most likely explanation was ultimately found to be protein degradation by endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation preceding successful secretion. This study highlighted the multifaceted nature of rProt production, prompting a global outlook for selection of rProt production systems.</p></details></div>

Alcohol oxidase (AOX) from Pichia pastoris was covalently immobilized on chemically treated polyvinylchloride (PVC) beaker and subsequently horseradish peroxidase (HRP), nafion (Nf), carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (c-MWCNTs), chitosan (CHIT) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were immobilized onto Au electrode to fabricate a working electrode. The enzyme coated PVC surface was analyzed morphologically via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At different stages of construction, the electrochemical properties of working electrode were deciphered by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The biosensor displayed optimal response in a short time span of 12 s at pH 7.5 and 35 C temperature. The working range exhibited by the proposed biosensor was 0.01 mM-42 mM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0001 microM and storage stability of 180 days at 4 C. When level of alcohol was evaluated in commercial samples via standard assay kit and existing biosensor, a good correlation (R(2 )= 0.98) was observed which authenticates its reliability.</p></details></div>

In industry, CDP-choline is synthesized by a two-step cell culture/permeabilized cell biotransformation method because substrates often do not enter cells in an efficient manner. This study develops a novel one-step living cell fermentation method for CDP-choline production. For this purpose, the feasibility of Pichia pastoris as a chassis was demonstrated by substrate feeding and CDP-choline production. Overexpression of choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase and choline kinase enhanced the choline transformation pathway and improved the biosynthesis of CDP-choline. Furthermore, co-overexpression of ScHnm1, which is a heterologous choline transporter, highly improved the utilization of choline substrates, despite its easy degradation in cells. This strategy increased CDP-choline titer by 55-folds comparing with the wild-type (WT). Overexpression of cytidine-5'-monophosphate (CMP) kinase and CDP kinase in the CMP transformation pathway showed no positive effects. An increase in the ATP production by citrate stimulation or metabolic pathway modification further improved CDP-choline biosynthesis by 120%. Finally, the orthogonal optimization of key substrates and pH was carried out, and the resulting CDP-choline titer (6.0 g/L) at optimum conditions increased 88 times the original titer in the WT. This study provides a new paradigm for CDP-choline bioproduction by living cells.</p></details></div>

We previously reported an sHSP from Oryza sativa (OsHSP20) that homodimerizes and forms granules within the cytoplasm but its function was unclear. We now show that OsHSP20 transcripts were significantly up-regulated by heat shock and high salinity but not by drought. A recombinant protein was purified and shown to inhibit the thermal aggregation of the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme in vitro, and this molecular chaperone activity suggested that OsHSP20 might be involved in stress resistance. Heterologous expression of OsHSP20 in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris cells enhanced heat and salt stress tolerance when compared with the control cultures. Transgenic rice plants constitutively overexpressing OsHSP20 and exposed to heat and salt treatments had longer roots and higher germination rates than those of control plants. A series of assays using its truncated mutants showed that its N-terminal arm plus the ACD domain was crucial for its homodimerization, molecular chaperone activity in vitro, and stress tolerance in vivo. The results supported the viewpoint that OsHSP20 could confer heat and salt tolerance by its molecular chaperone activity in different organisms and also provided a more thorough characterization of HSP20-mediated stress tolerance in O. sativa.</p></details></div>

A high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis demonstrated that the degradation of corn and rice straw by crude AgCMCase mainly produced glucose and cellobiose. Temperature, reaction time and enzyme dose were the significant variables affecting corn and rice straw degradation. After the optimization of RSM, a model was proposed to predict 1.48% reducing sugar yield with the optimum temperature (51.45 degrees C) and reaction time (3.84 h) from the straw degradation. The reaction of crude AgCMCase and rice straw in the optimized condition resulted in reducing sugar production of 1.61% that agrees the prediction.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Our findings suggest that the crude AgCMCase is suitable to be used in straw conversion.</p></details></div>

Actins have different post-translational modifications (PTMs) in different organisms, including methionine, alanine, aspartate and glutamate N-acetylation, N-arginylation and the methylation of the histidine at residue 73 (His-73), with different organisms displaying a distinct signature of PTMs. Currently, methods are not available to produce actin isoforms with an organism-specific PTM profile. Here, we report the Pick-ya actin method, a method to express actin isoforms from any eukaryote with its own key characteristic PTM pattern. We achieve this using a synthetic biology strategy in a yeast strain that expresses, one, actin isoforms with the desired N-end via ubiquitin fusion and, two, mammalian enzymes that promote acetylation and methylation.

MnALF4 is one isoform of ALFs isolated from the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium nipponense. In the present study, MnALF4 gene was successfully expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and the recombinant MnALF4 protein exhibited efficient and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. When prawns were injected with rMnALF4 before bacterial challenge with E. coli, the recombinant protein effectively promote the elimination of bacteria by the host. It manifested that rMnALF4 could effectively kill the invading bacteria in vivo. Treatment with rMnALF4 led to remarkable changes in bacterial morphology, such as spheroidization, oversized bacteria, and cell lysis. In addition, rMnALF4 showed weak hemolysis activity to the rabbit red blood cells.

A new recombinant protein-based rotavirus vaccine candidate derived from non-replicative viral subunits fused to a P2 tetanus toxoid CD4(+) T cell epitope is currently under clinical development. We have sought to simplify the existing manufacturing process to meet these aims. To this end, we have taken a holistic process development approach to reduce process complexity and costs while producing a product with the required characteristics. We have changed expression system from Escherichia coli to Pichia pastoris, to produce a secreted product, thereby reducing the number of purification steps. However, the presence of proteases poses challenges to product quality. To understand the effect of fermentation parameters on product quality small-scale fermentations were carried out. Media pH and fermentation duration had the greatest impact on the proportion of full-length product. A novel acidic pH pulse strategy was used to minimize proteolysis, and this combined with an early harvest time significantly increased the proportion of full-length material (60-75%). An improved downstream process using a combination of CIEX and AIEX to further reduce proteases, resulted in maintaining product quality (95% yield).</p></details></div>

Microbial rutinosidases are part of the rutin catabolic pathway, enabling the microorganism to utilize rutin and related plant phenolic glycosides. Here, we report the first three-dimensional structure of a rutinosidase determined at 1.27-A resolution. The rutinosidase from Aspergillus niger K2 (AnRut), a member of glycoside hydrolase family GH-5, subfamily 23, was heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. The X-ray structure of AnRut is represented by a distorted (beta/alpha)8 barrel fold with its closest structural homologue being an exo-beta-(1,3)-glucanase from Candida albicans (CaExg). The catalytic site is located in a deep pocket with a striking structural similarity to CaExg. However, the entrance to the active site of AnRut has been found to be different from that of CaExg - a mostly unstructured section of ~ 40 residues present in CaExg is missing in AnRut, whereas an additional loop of 13 amino acids partially covers the active site of AnRut. NMR analysis of reaction products provided clear evidence for a retaining reaction mechanism of AnRut. Unexpectedly, quercetin 3-O-glucoside was found to be a better substrate than rutin, and thus, AnRut cannot be considered a typical diglycosidase. Mutational analysis of conserved active site residues in combination with in silico modeling allowed identification of essential interactions for enzyme activity and helped to reveal further details of substrate binding.

Decorated cells were magneto-responsible and easily harvested by applying an external magnetic field. The efficiency of magnetic immobilization (Ei) for cell removal was in direct relation with the MNP concentration and time of exposure to the magnetic field. By increasing the nanoparticles concentration, cells were harvested in a shorter period. Complete cell removal (Ei approximately 100) was achieved in >/=0.5 mg/mL of MNPs in just 30 s. HSA is produced in an extremely high cell density (OD ~20) and it is the first time that magnetic immobilization was successfully employed for harvesting such a thick cell suspension. After 5 days of induction the cells, which were immobilized with 0.25 to 1 mg/mL of nanoparticles, showed an increased potency for recombinant HSA production.

Ergosterol is the main sterol molecule found in the cell membranes of yeasts and other fungi. Like the cholesterol found in mammalian cells, ergosterol has been proposed to have an ordering and condensing effect on saturated phospholipid membranes. The effects of cholesterol have been investigated extensively and result in an increase in the membrane thickness and the lipid acyl chain order. Less information is available on the effects of ergosterol on phospholipid membranes. Neutron Diffraction (ND) was used to characterize the effect of ergosterol on lipid multilayers prepared with deuterated natural phospholipids extracted from the yeast Pichia pastoris. The data show that the effect of ergosterol on membranes prepared from the natural phospholipid extract rich in unsaturated acyl chains, differs from what has been observed previously in membranes rich in saturated phospholipids. In contrast to cholesterol in synthetic phospholipid membranes, the presence of ergosterol up to 30 mol % in yeast phospholipid membranes only slightly altered the multilayer structure. In particular, only a small decrease in the multilayer d-spacing was observed as function of increasing ergosterol concentrations. This result highlights the need for further investigation to elucidate the effects of ergosterol in biological lipid mixtures.</p></details></div>

Knockdown of PtCLec1 could down-regulate the expression of phagocytosis-related genes, but enhance the expression levels of prophenoloxidase (proPO) system-related genes, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), MyD88 and Relish. All these results indicate that PtCLec1 might act as a PRR in immune recognition and an opsonin in pathogen elimination.</p></details></div>

Eukaryotic cells are subdivided into several organelles enclosed by lipid membranes. Organelle proteomes define their functions. Yeasts, as simple eukaryotic single cell organisms, are valuable models for higher eukaryotes and frequently used for biotechnological applications. While the subcellular distribution of proteins is well studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this is not the case for other yeasts like Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris). Different to most well-studied yeasts, K. phaffii can grow on methanol, which provides specific features for production of heterologous proteins and as a model for peroxisome biology. We isolated microsomes, very early Golgi, early Golgi, plasma membrane, vacuole, cytosol, peroxisomes and mitochondria of K. phaffii from glucose- and methanol-grown cultures, quantified their proteomes by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry of either unlabeled or tandem mass tag-labeled samples. Classification of the proteins by their relative enrichment, allowed the separation of enriched proteins from potential contaminants in all cellular compartments except the peroxisomes. We discuss differences to S. cerevisiae, outline organelle specific findings and the major metabolic pathways and provide an interactive map of the subcellular localization of proteins in K. phaffii.</p></details></div>

Antivirals are indispensable to control disease caused by epidemic as well as pandemic influenza A. We developed a novel anti-influenza A virus approach based on an engineered single-domain antibody (VHH) construct that can selectively recruit innate immune cells to the sites of virus replication. This protective construct comprises two VHHs. One VHH binds with nanomolar affinity to the conserved influenza A matrix protein 2 (M2) ectodomain (M2e). Co-crystal structure analysis revealed that the complementarity determining regions 2 and 3 of this VHH embrace M2e. The second selected VHH specifically binds to the mouse Fcgamma Receptor IV (FcgammaRIV) and was genetically fused to the M2e-specific VHH, which resulted in a bi-specific VHH-based construct that could be efficiently expressed in Pichia pastoris. In the presence of M2 expressing or influenza A virus-infected target cells, this single domain antibody construct selectively activated the mouse FcgammaRIV. Moreover, intranasal delivery of this bispecific FcgammaRIV-engaging VHH construct protected wild type but not FcgammaRIV (-/-) mice against challenge with an H3N2 influenza virus. These results provide proof of concept that VHHs directed against a surface exposed viral antigen can be readily armed with effector functions that trigger protective antiviral activity beyond direct virus neutralization.</p></details></div>

Currently, two copies of GCSF, named GCSFa and GCSFb, have been identified in teleost fish, but data on the functions and signal pathways of these fish GCSFs are still limited. In the present study, a GCSFa homologue (LcGCSFa) was identified from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). The open reading frame (ORF) of LcGCSFa is 636 bp long and encodes a protein of 211 amino acids (aa), with a 19-aa signal peptide and a typical IL-6 domain, conserved in fish GCSF sequences. The phylogenetic analysis showed that LcGCSFa clustered with other fish GCSFa homologues. LcGCSFa was constitutively expressed in all tissues tested and significantly up-regulated in head kidney and spleen by Vibrio alginolyticus or poly(</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C). LcGCSFa transcripts were also detected in primary head kidney leucocytes (PKL), primary head kidney macrophages (PKM), and primary head kidney granulocytes (PKG), and significantly up-regulated in PKL and PKG by LPS or poly(</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C). These data indicated that LcGCSFa may be involved in the immune responses induced by bacterium and virus. The recombinant LcGCSFa protein (rLcGCSFa) produced in Pichia pastoris promoted the proliferation of PKL both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, rLcGCSFa significantly increased both transcription and phosphorylation levels of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (LcSTAT3 and LcSTAT5) in PKL, which are required for the GCSF-dependent proliferation. These results showed that LcGCSFa may promote the proliferation of PKL via the activation of LcSTAT3 and LcSTAT5, suggesting a conserved role across vertebrate GCSFs.</p></details></div>

Leech hyaluronidase (LHyal) is a newly discovered hyaluronidase with outstanding enzymatic properties. The Pichia pastoris expression system of LHyal that depends on AOX1 promoter (PAOX1) has been constructed. However, the addition of the toxic inducer methanol is a big safety concern. Here, a combinational strategy was adopted for constitutive expression of LHyal to high level in P. pastoris. By optimizing the combination of promoters PGAP, PGAP(m), and PTEF1 and signal peptides alpha-factor, nsB, and sp23, the enzyme activity of extracellular LHyal reached 1.38 x 10(5) U/mL in shake flasks. N-terminal engineering with neutral polar amino acids further increased LHyal activity to 2.06 x 10(5) U/mL. In addition, the impact of overexpressing transcription factors Aft1, Gal4-like, and Yap1 on LHyal production was also investigated. We found the co-expression of Aft1 significantly enhanced the expression of LHyal to 3.03 x 10(5) U/mL. Finally, LHyal activity of 2.12 x 10(6) U/mL was achieved in a 3-L fermenter, with a high productivity of 1.96 x 10(4) U/mL/h. The engineered LHyal-producing Pichia pastoris strains will be more attractive for production of hyaluronidase on industrial scale.</p></details></div>

The emergency of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, especially in human and animal health fields, leads to an urgent need of exploration of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, NZX, a plectasin-derived peptide, was firstly expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 and was purified by cation exchange chromatography, followed by detection of its antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the total secreted protein concentration in fermentation supernatant was up to 2820 mg/L (29 degrees C) after 120-h induction in a 5-L fermentor. The yield of NZX reached up to 965 mg/L with a purity of 92.6%. The recombinant expressed NZX had a strong antimicrobial activity, high stability, and low toxicity. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of NZX and ceftriaxone (CRO) against Gram-positive bacteria were 0.46 to 0.91 muM and 6.04 to 12.09 muM, respectively. The time-killing curves showed that S. hyicus NCTC10350 was killed completely by 2x and 4 x MIC of NZX within 24 h. NZX also exhibited the intracellular activity against S. hyicus in Hacat cells. After treatment with NZX (10 mg/kg) and CRO (60 mg/kg), the survival rates of mice were 100% and 83.3%, respectively. NZX inhibited the bacterial translocation, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha/IL-1beta/IL-6), upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and ameliorated multiple-organ injuries (the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney).

However, the current systems for multigene co-expression in P. pastoris are not efficient. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has an ability to recruit the ribosome to initiate protein synthesis by cap-independent translation manner. This study seeks to screen IRES sequences that are functional in P. pastoris, which will allow P. pastoris to express multiple proteins in a single mRNA and increase its efficacy as a platform for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Results: In order to efficiently screen the IRES sequences, we first set out to create a screening system using LacZ gene. Due to the cryptic transcription of the LacZ gene, we established the alpha-complementation system of beta-galactosidase in P. pastoris with the optimum length of the alpha-complementing peptide at ~ 92 amino acids. The optimal alpha-complementing peptide was then used as the second reporter to screen IRESes in the engineered GS115 expressing the corresponding omega-peptide. A total of 34 reported IRESes were screened. After ruling out all false positive or negative IRESes, only seven IRESes were functional in P. pastoris, which were from TEV, PVY, RhPV, TRV, KSHV, crTMV viruses and the 5'-UTR of the YAP1 gene of S. cerevisiae. Conclusions: We showed here that alpha-complementation also works in P. pastoris and it can be used in a variety of in vivo studies. The functional IRESes screened in this study can be used to introduce multiple genes into P. pastoris via a prokaryotic-like polycistronic manner, which provided new efficient tools for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology researches in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Recently, a bacterial enzyme named PETase was found to have the novel ability to degrade the highly crystallized PET. However, the enzymatic activity of native PETase is still low limiting its possible use in recycling of PET. In this study, we developed a whole-cell biocatalyst by displaying PETase on the surface of yeast (Pichia pastoris) cell to improve its degradation efficiency. Our data shows that PETase could be functionally displayed on the yeast cell with enhanced pH and thermal stability. The turnover rate of the PETase-displaying yeast whole-cell biocatalyst towards highly crystallized PET dramatically increased about 36-fold compared with that of purified PETase. Furthermore, the whole-cell biocatalyst showed stable turnover rate after seven repeated use and under some chemical/solvent conditions, and its ability to degrade different commercial highly crystallized PET bottles.

The advantage of this system is its versatility at the vector level, achieved by the introduction of a novel expression cassette. This cassette contains a unified multi-cloning site, affinity tags, protease cleavable linkers, an optional secretion signal, and common restriction endonuclease sites at key positions. This way, genes of interest and all elements of the cassette can be switched freely among the vectors, using restriction digestion and ligation without the need of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This vector set allows rapid protein expression screening of various hosts and affinity tags. The reason behind this approach was that it is difficult to predict which expression host and which affinity tag will lead to functional expression. The new system is based on four optimized and frequently used expression systems (Escherichia coli pET, the yeast Pichia pastoris, pVL and pIEx for Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells and pLEXm based mammalian systems), which were modified as described above. The resulting vector set was named pONE series. We have successfully applied the pONE vector set for expression of the following human proteins: the tumour suppressor RASSF1A and the protein kinases Aurora A and LIMK1. Finally, we used it to express the large multidomain protein, Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2, 164 kDa) and demonstrated that the yeast Pichia pastoris reproducibly expresses the large ROCK2 kinase with identical activity to the insect cell produced counterpart. To our knowledge this is among the largest proteins ever expressed in yeast. This demonstrates that the cost-effective yeast system can match and replace the industry-standard insect cell expression system even for large and complex mammalian proteins.

Treatment of sugar beet pulp with Pichia-secreted TS-ABN released FAOs recovered by hydrophobic chromatography at 1.52% (w/w). The isolated FAOs averaged seven arabinose residues per ferulic acid, and treatment of T84 human colon epithelial cells significantly increased expression of two key tight junction-related proteins-zonula occludens-1 and occludin-in a dose-dependent manner.

Twenty years ago, we, in collaboration with German researchers, were the first to experimentally describe a system for coordinated regulation of proteasomal gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system consists of the ScRpn4 transcription factor and its binding site, called PACE. Based on the results of a bioinformatics search in the first sequenced yeast genomes, Rpn4-like proteins and PACE-like elements were postulated for other species of the class Saccharomycetes. We experimentally characterized Rpn4-like proteins in the biotechnologically significant yeast species Komagataella pfaffii (Pichia pastoris), Yarrowia lipolytica, and Debaryomyces hansenii and the opportunistic yeast Candida glabrata. As ample information accumulates for the genome sequences of new yeast species and strains, the question arises as to how diverse the regulatory system of proteasomal genes is in terms of structure and likely mechanisms of function. In this work, a bioinformatics search for Rpn4-like proteins and PACE-like elements was conducted in 3111 strains belonging to 427 yeast species of the class Saccharomycetes. It was shown that only the DNA-binding domain is conserved among Rpn4-like proteins, in accordance with conservation of PACE elements. Certain systems were found to contain more than one Rpn4-like protein with structural differences in the DNA-binding domain or to include an autoregulation of the genes for Rpn4-like proteins.

However, degradation caused by digestive enzymes in the intestine hampers its application. Improving the resistance of feed enzymes against proteases is crucial in livestock farming. To improve the resistance of beta-glucosidase against pepsin and trypsin, a rational molecular design based on the inhibition of bound-state formation and secondary design was developed. The strategy includes: (1) prediction of the interaction surface of the pepsin-BGL1 complex structure, (2) prediction of key amino acids affecting the formation of the complex, (3) optimization of pepsin-resistant mutants by structural evaluation, (4) secondary molecular design based on pepsin-resistant mutants, and optimization of pepsin and trypsin-resistant mutants. Two BGL1 protein mutants (BGL1(Q627C) and BGL1(Q627C/R543H/R646W)) were constructed, and then mutated and wild-type BGL1s were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The half-life of BGL1(Q627C) and BGL1(Q627C/R543H/R646W) were 1.36 and 1.51 times that of the wild type upon pepsin exposure, respectively. For trypsin resistance, the half-life were 0.93 and 1.53 times that of the wild type, respectively. Compare to those of the wild type, most of the basic enzymatic properties of both mutants were not significantly changed except for increased Michaelis constants. The rational design method can be used as a guide for modifying other feed enzymes.</p></details></div>

Natural 2-PE is costly and cannot meet the market demand due to the relative low content of 2-PE in the plants. Thus, there is an increasing interest in the search for alternative routes for 2-PE production. Here we demonstrate the engineering of Pichia pastoris to produce 2-PE directly from simple sugars for the first time. We first demonstrated that improving downstream pathway from phenylpyruvate to 2-PE by overexpressing ARO10 and ADH6 could increase the biosynthesis of 2-PE. Then several genetic engineering strategies were developed to increase phenylpyruvate availability to improve 2-PE production. 1169mg/L of 2-PE was accumulated in the final engineered strain. This study showed the potential of P. pastoris as a host strain to produce industrially interested 2-PE by metabolic engineering.</p></details></div>

Xylan is the main hemicellulose component of energy crops and for its complete hydrolysis a system consisting of several enzymes acting cooperatively, including endoxylanases (XYN), beta-xylosidases (XYL) and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases (ABF) is necessary. The current work aimed at evaluating the effect of recombinant hemicellulolytic enzymes on the enzymatic hydrolysis of steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse (SEB). One recombinant endoxylanase (HXYN2) and one recombinant beta-xylosidase (HXYLA) from Humicola grisea var thermoidea, together with an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase (AFB3) from Penicillium pupurogenum, all produced in Pichia pastoris, were used to formulate an efficient enzyme mixture for SEB hydrolysis using a 2(3) Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD). The most potent enzyme for SEB hydrolysis was ABF3. Subsequently, the optimal enzyme mixture was used in combination with commercial cellulases (Accellerase 1500), either simultaneously or in sequential experiments. The supplementation of Accellerase 1500 with hemicellulases enhanced the glucose yield from SEB hydrolysis by 14.6%, but this effect could be raised to 50% when hemicellulases were added prior to hydrolysis with commercial cellulases. These results were supported by scanning electron microscopy, which revealed the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis on SEB fibers. Our results show the potential of complementary enzyme activities to improve enzymatic hydrolysis of SEB, thus improving the efficiency of the hydrolytic process.</p></details></div>

An adalimumab Fab mutant with a novel interchain SS bond (CH1:C177-</p><p><strong>CL:</strong>C160) and one cysteine at the C-terminal end (mutSS FabSH) was designed to maintain Fab thermostability and for site-specific PEGylation. MutSS FabSH was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified mutSS FabSH was conjugated with 20-kDa PEG targeted at the free cysteine. Based on ELISA, PEGylation did not affect the binding capacity of the mutSS FabSH. To confirm the influence of PEGylation on the pharmacokinetic behavior of the Fab, PEGylated mutSS FabSH was administered to mice via tail vein injection. Analysis of the mean serum concentration of the PEGylated mutSS FabSH versus time through ELISA indicated an increase in half-life compared to that of non-PEGylated wild-type Fab. Consequently, we have successfully demonstrated that a Fab mutant with a novel interchain SS bond and one free cysteine at the C-terminal end can be PEGylated without changes in functionality.

However, in Brazil, the process of obtaining 2 G ethanol did not reach a basic standard to achieve relevant and economically viable results. Several studies have currently been addressed to solve these issues. A critical stage in the bioethanol production is the deployment of efficient and stable enzymes to catalyze the saccharification step into the process of biomass conversion. The present study comprises a screening for genes coding for plant biomass degradation enzymes, followed by cloning a selected gene, addressing its heterologous expression, and characterizing enzymatic activity towards cellulose derived substrates, with a view to second-generation ethanol production. A cDNA database of the Cotton Boll Weevil, Anthonomus grandis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), an insect that feeds on cotton plant biomass, was used as a source of plant biomass degradation enzyme genes. A larva and adult midgut-specific beta-1,4-Endoglucanase-coding gene (AgraGH45-1) was cloned and expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Its amino acid sequence, including the two catalytic domains, shares high identity with other Coleoptera Glycosyl Hydrolases from family 45 (GH45). AgraGH45-1 activity was detected in a Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) degradation assay and the optimal conditions for enzymatic activity was pH 5.0 at 50 degrees C. When compared to commercial cellulase from Aspergillus niger, Agra GH45-1 was 1.3-fold more efficient to degrade HEC substrate. Together, these results show that AgraGH45-1 is a valid candidate to be engineered and be tested for 2 G ethanol production.</p></details></div>

PcBGAL35A showed a unique substrate specificity that has not been reported so far. Based on the results of enzymological tests and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance, PcBGAL35A was found to hydrolyze beta-1,4-galactosyl residues linked to L-rhamnose in rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) of pectin, as well as p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and beta-D-galactosyl oligosaccharides. PcBGAL35B was determined to be a common BGAL through molecular phylogenetic tree and substrate specificity analysis. PcGALX35C was found to have similar catalytic capacities for the beta-1,4-galactosyl oligomer and polymer. Furthermore, PcGALX35C hydrolyzed RG-I-linked beta-1,4-galactosyl oligosaccharide side chains with a degree of polymerization of 2 or higher in pectin. The amino acid sequence similarity of PcBGAL35A was approximately 30% with most GH35 BGALs, whose enzymatic properties have been characterized. The amino acid sequence of PcBGAL35B was approximately 80% identical to those of BGALs from Penicillium sp. The amino acid sequence of PcGALX35C was classified into the same phylogenetic group as PcBGAL35A. Pfam analysis revealed that the three BGALs had five domains including a catalytic domain. Our findings suggest that PcBGAL35A and PcGALX35C are enzymes involved in the degradation of galactosylated RG-I in pectin.

TNF-alpha genes have been identified in various fish species, however, their biological functions remain to be further clarified. In this study, we identified a novel TNF-alpha homologue (LcTNF-alpha2) from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), which shares a low amino acid sequence identity to the previously reported large yellow croaker TNF-alpha (LcTNF-alpha1). The open reading frame of LcTNF-alpha2 is 714 nucleotides long, encoding a peptide of 237 amino acids (aa). The deduced LcTNF-alpha2 protein contains a 23-aa transmembrane region, a TACE restriction site at residues T(71)/L(72), a TNF family signature (I(108)- F(135)), and two conserved cysteine residues (C(39) and C(179)), as found in other known TNF-alpha sequences. Both LcTNF-alpha1 and LcTNF-alpha2 genes were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues and significantly up-regulated in the spleen and head kidney by Vibrio alginolyticus. Their transcripts were also detected in primary head kidney monocytes/macrophages (MO/Mvarphis), lymphocytes (PKLs), granulocytes (PKGs), and large yellow croaker head kidney (LYCK) cell line and significantly increased in these cell types by inactivated Vibrio alginolyticus. Recombinant LcTNF-alpha1 and LcTNF-alpha2 proteins (rLcTNF-alpha1 and rLcTNF-alpha2) produced in Pichia pastoris not only significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also promoted the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6,IL-8, and TNF-alpha1) in MO/Mvarphis from large yellow croaker. Even more, after stimulation with rLcTNF-alpha1 and rLcTNF-alpha2, the production of nitrogen oxide (NO) and the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene were significantly up-regulated. However, only rLcTNF-alpha1 remarkedly enhanced the phagocytosis of MO/Mvarphis and increased the expression of TNF-alpha2 in MO/Mvarphis. These results therefore indicated that LcTNF-alpha1 and LcTNF-alpha2 both play roles in promoting activation of head kidney MO/Mvarphis.</p></details></div>

Like most biotechnological production hosts, P. pastoris is heterotrophic and grows on organic feedstocks that have competing uses in the production of food and animal feed. In a step toward more sustainable industrial processes, we describe the conversion of P. pastoris into an autotroph that grows on CO2. By addition of eight heterologous genes and deletion of three native genes, we engineer the peroxisomal methanol-assimilation pathway of P. pastoris into a CO2-fixation pathway resembling the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, the predominant natural CO2-fixation pathway. The resulting strain can grow continuously with CO2 as a sole carbon source at a micromax of 0.008 h(-1). The specific growth rate was further improved to 0.018 h(-1) by adaptive laboratory evolution. This engineered P. pastoris strain may promote sustainability by sequestering the greenhouse gas CO2, and by avoiding consumption of an organic feedstock with alternative uses in food production.</p></details></div>

The feed conversion ratio and feed efficiency were determined in Epinephelus lanceolatus (grouper) fed with rTH2-3-supplemented diet for 28 days. In addition, grouper showed enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity after rTH2-3 feeding compared to regular-diet-fed fish.

Here we report on a spectrophotometric assay for lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO), which is an advancement of the previously published 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP)-based LPMO assay. The new assay is based on hydrocoerulignone as substrate and hydrogen peroxide as cosubstrate and aims toward a higher sensitivity at acidic pH and a more reliable detection of LPMO in complex matrices like culture media. Results: An LPMO activity assay following the colorimetric oxidation of hydrocoerulignone to coerulignone was developed. This peroxidase activity of LPMO in the presence of hydrogen peroxide can be detected in various buffers between pH 4-8. By reducing the substrate and cosubstrate concentration, the assay has been optimized for minimal autoxidation and enzyme deactivation while maintaining sensitivity. Finally, the optimized and validated LPMO assay was used to follow the recombinant expression of an LPMO in Pichia pastoris and to screen for interfering substances in fermentation media suppressing the assayed reaction. Conclusions: The biphenol hydrocoerulignone is a better substrate for LPMO than the monophenol 2,6-DMP, because of a ~ 30 times lower apparent K M value and a 160 mV lower oxidation potential. This greatly increases the measured LPMO activity when using hydrocoerulignone instead of 2,6-DMP under otherwise similar assay conditions. The improved activity allows the adaptation of the LPMO assay toward a higher sensitivity, different buffers and pH values, more stable assay conditions or to overcome low concentrations of inhibiting substances. The developed assay protocol and optimization guidelines increase the adaptability and applicability of the hydrocoerulignone assay for the production, purification, and characterization of LPMOs.</p></details></div>

It targets chitin synthesis and causes plasma membrane permeabilization in many human- and plant-pathogenic fungi, but its exact mode of action is not known. After adoption of the "damage-response framework of microbial pathogenesis" regarding the analysis of interactions between AMPs and microorganisms, we have recently proposed that the cytotoxic capacity of a given AMP depends not only on the presence/absence of its target(s) in the host and the AMP concentration applied but also on other variables, such as microbial survival strategies. We show here using the examples of three filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Fusarium graminearum) and two yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris) that the important parameters defining the AFP susceptibilities of these fungi are (i) the presence/absence of glycosylceramides, (ii) the presence/absence of Delta3(E) desaturation of the fatty acid chain therein, and (iii) the (dis)ability of these fungi to respond to AFP inhibitory effects with the fortification of their cell walls via increased chitin and beta-(1,3)-glucan synthesis. These observations support the idea of the adoption of the damage-response framework to holistically understand the outcome of AFP inhibitory effects.IMPORTANCE Our data suggest a fundamental role of glycosylceramides in the susceptibility of fungi to AFP. We discovered that only a minor structural difference in these molecules-namely, the saturation level of their fatty acid chain, controlled by a 2-hydroxy fatty N-acyl-Delta3(E)-desaturase-represents a key to understanding the inhibitory activity of AFP. As glycosylceramides are important components of fungal plasma membranes, we propose a model which links AFP-mediated inhibition of chitin synthesis in fungi with its potential to disturb plasma membrane integrity.</p></details></div>

These hosts require genomic engineering to meet clinically relevant product qualities and titers, but the adaptation of tools for editing genomes, such as CRISPR-Cas9, has been slow for poorly characterized hosts. Specifically, a lack of biochemical characterization of RNA polymerase III transcription has hindered reliable expression of guide RNAs in new hosts. Here, we present a sequencing-based strategy for the design of host-specific cassettes for modular, reliable, expression of guide RNAs. Using this strategy, we achieved up to 95% gene editing efficiency in the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii. We applied this approach for the rapid, multiplexed engineering of a complex phenotype, achieving humanized product glycosylation in two sequential steps of engineering. Reliable extension of simple gene editing tools to nonmodel manufacturing hosts will enable rapid engineering of manufacturing strains tuned for specific product profiles and potentially decrease the costs and timelines for process development.</p></details></div>

Cn invades the central nervous system by overcoming the highly restricted blood-brain barrier (BBB). We previously determined that a secreted fungal metalloprotease, Mpr1, that also confers crossing ability to yeast upon CnMPR1 expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is central to this process. This led us to question whether Mpr1 could be engineered to function as part of a nanocarrier delivery vehicle. Here, a eukaryotic expression system produced proteolytically active Mpr1 recombinant protein that was successfully conjugated to functionalized quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles and readily internalized by brain microvascular endothelial cells. An in vitro BBB model showed QD-Mpr1 crossed the BBB significantly better than mock QD, and QD-Mpr1 did not damage BBB integrity. Internalization of QD-Mpr1 occurred by membrane invaginations and endocytic pits typical of receptor-mediated endocytosis involving clathrin-coated entry points. This study substantiates the notion that fungal mechanisms of BBB entry may be harnessed for new drug delivery platform technologies.</p></details></div>

The beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from Talaromyces flavus is remarkable in terms of its synthetic potential, broad substrate specificity, and tolerance to substrate modifications. It can be heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris in a high yield. The mutation of the Tyr470 residue to histidine greatly enhances its transglycosylation capability. The aim of this work was to identify the structural requirements of this model beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase for its transglycosylation acceptors and formulate a structure-activity relationship study. Enzymatic reactions were performed using an activated glycosyl donor, 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminide or 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminide, and a panel of glycosyl acceptors of varying structural features (N-acetylglucosamine, glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, N-acetylmuramic acid, and glucuronic acid). The transglycosylation products were isolated and structurally characterized. The C-2 N-acetamido group in the acceptor molecule was found to be essential for recognition by the enzyme. The presence of the C-2 hydroxyl moiety strongly hindered the normal course of transglycosylation, yielding unique non-reducing disaccharides in a low yield. Moreover, whereas the gluco-configuration at C-4 steered the glycosylation into the beta(1-4) position, the galacto-acceptor afforded a beta(1-6) glycosidic linkage. The Y470H mutant enzyme was tested with acceptors based on beta-glycosides of uronic acid and N-acetylmuramic acid. With the latter acceptor, we were able to isolate and characterize one glycosylation product in a low yield. To our knowledge, this is the first example of enzymatic glycosylation of an N-acetylmuramic acid derivative. In order to explain these findings and predict enzyme behavior, a modeling study was accomplished that correlated with the acquired experimental data.</p></details></div>

RNA extraction from the yeast Pichia pastoris requires specific pretreatment steps to ensure the reproducibility of downstream applications, but current methods and extraction kits are generally adapted for the conventional yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has a different cell wall composition. We therefore set out to compare the efficacy of two different RNA isolation methods when applied to P. pastoris: (i) phenol/chloroform extraction and (ii) silica spin-column absorption. We compared the yield, integrity, and purity of the resulting isolated RNA from the two methods (using two different types of commercial columns for silica spin-column absorption) and further optimized them through variations in the pretreatment steps.

Mill. fruit has exotic organoleptic properties however commercialization is a challenge due to its fast and intensive softening. Texture modifications associated to ripening are related to cell wall metabolism. Main cell wall polysaccharides metabolized in F. chiloensis fruit are pectins, being rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) an abundant pectin domain in strawberry. Several enzymes belonging to the fruit molecular machinery have been described to act on different cell wall polysaccharides in F. chiloensis, but none acting on the main chain of RG-I until now. A gene sequence coding for a rhamnogalacturonan endolyase (RG-lyase) (EC 4.2.2.23) was isolated from F. chiloensis. The FchRGL1 sequence belongs to Polysaccharide Lyase family 4 and contains the three functional domains of RG-lyases: RGL4 domain, fibronectin type III and the carbohydrate binding module. In addition, it contains key amino acid residues for activity and Ca(2+) coordination. qRT-PCR analyses indicate that FchRGL1 transcripts increase in fruit throughout ripening. RG-lyase activity evidences a remarkable increase as the fruit ripens. The heterologous expression of FchRGL1 in Pichia pastoris provided an active protein that allows its biochemical characterization. RG-lyase activity is optimum at pH 5.0, 25-30 degrees C and 2 mM Ca(2+). A KM of 0.086 mg mL(-1) was determined for potato RG-I, and the enzyme undergoes inhibition at high substrate concentration. The enzyme is also able to degrade the mucilage of germinating A. thaliana's seeds. Finally, the properties of FchRGL1 and its expression pattern are congruent with a crucial role in cell wall re-organization during softening of F. chiloensis fruit.</p></details></div>

There is little information about the sequence diversity of K. phaffii or the genetic properties of this species.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We sequenced the genomes of all the known isolates of K. phaffii. We made a genetic cross between derivatives of two isolates that differ at 44,000 single nucleotide polymorphism sites, and used this cross to analyze the rate and landscape of meiotic recombination. We conducted tetrad analysis by making use of the property that K. phaffii haploids do not mate in rich media, which enabled us to isolate and sequence the four types of haploid cell that are present in the colony that forms when a tetra-type ascus germinates.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We found that only four distinct natural isolates of K. phaffii exist in public yeast culture collections. The meiotic recombination rate in K. phaffii is approximately 3.5 times lower than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with an average of 25 crossovers per meiosis. Recombination is suppressed, and genetic diversity among natural isolates is low, in a region around centromeres that is much larger than the centromeres themselves.

A new FAE (EpFAE1) encoding gene was isolated from Eupenicillium parvum and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris cells. Based on phylogenetic tree analysis, the protein EpFAE1 belongs to type A of the seventh FAE subfamily. Using methyl ferulate as substrate, the optimum temperature and pH for the catalytic activity of EpFAE1 were 50 degrees C and 5.5, respectively. The enzyme exhibited high stability at 50 degrees C, in a wide pH range (3.0-11.0), or in the presence of 2 M of NaCl. Together with the endo-xylanase EpXYN1, EpFAE1 released 72.32% and 4.00% of the alkali-extractable FA from de-starched wheat bran (DSWB) or de-starched corn bran (DSCB), respectively. Meanwhile, the substrates were pretreated with 1.75% (for DSWB) or 1.0% (for DSCB) of phosphoric acid (PA) at 90 degrees C for 12 h, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the soluble and insoluble fractions. The release efficiencies of FA were up to 84.64% for DSWB and 66.73% for DSCB. Combined dilute PA pretreatment with enzymatic hydrolysis is a low-cost and highly efficient method for the extraction of FA from cereal brans.</p></details></div>

Moreover, recombinant protein overproduction often results in ER-stress and oxidative stress, causing deviations from the optimal NAD(P)H regeneration balance. In this context, overexpression of genes encoding enzymes catalyzing endogenous NADPH producing reactions, such as the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, has been previously shown to improve protein production in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella spp).In this study, we evaluate the overexpression of the S. cerevisiae POS5-encoded NADH kinase in a recombinant P. pastoris strain as an alternative approach to overcome such redox constraints. Specifically, POS5 was co-overexpressed in a strain secreting an antibody fragment, either by directing Pos5 to the cytosol or to the mitochondria. The physiology of the resulting strains was evaluated in continuous cultivations with glycerol or glucose as sole carbon source, as well as under hypoxia (on glucose). Cytosolic targeting of Pos5 NADH kinase resulted in lower biomass-substrate yields but allowed for a 2-fold increase in product specific productivity. In contrast, Pos5 NADH kinase targeting to the mitochondria did not affect the growth physiology and recombinant protein production significantly. Growth physiological parameters were in silico evaluated using the recent upgraded version (v3.0) of the P. pastoris consensus genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026, providing insights on the impact of POS5 overexpression on metabolic flux distributions.Importance Recombinant protein overproduction often results in oxidative stress, causing deviations from the optimal redox cofactor regeneration balance. This becomes one of the limiting factors in obtaining high levels of heterologous protein production. Overexpression of redox affecting enzymes has been explored in other organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a mean to fine tune the cofactor regeneration balance in order to obtain higher protein titers. In the present work this strategy is explored in P. pastoris In particular one NADH kinase enzyme from S. cerevisiae (Pos5) is used, either in the cytosol or in mitochondria of P. pastoris, and its impact in the production of a model protein (antibody fragment) is evaluated. A significant improvement in the production of the model protein is observed, when the kinase is directed to the cytosol. These results are significant in the field of heterologous protein production in general and in particular in the development of improved metabolic engineering strategies for P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

We examined the carbon source requirements for mating-type (MAT) switching and mating in both species. Haploid strains of O. polymorpha and K. phaffii are homothallic, and switch MAT by a flip/flop mechanism in which a chromosomal region containing the MAT genes undergoes an inversion. MAT switching is induced by nitrogen starvation in both species and can be detected 4-6 hr after induction. Both switching and mating require a utilizable carbon source that can be either fermentable or nonfermentable. We further observed that although methanol can be used as a sole carbon source in both species, it does not support the induction of MAT switching or mating. Our results provide insight into the nutritional cues that influence entry into sexual processes in methylotrophic yeasts that undergo flip/flop MAT switching.</p></details></div>

The market demand for lycopene promotes research in metabolic engineering of heterologous hosts for lycopene. In this study, Pichia pastoris strain GS115 was genetically engineered to produce lycopene by integrating the heterologous lycopene biosynthesis genes from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032. The resulting strain, L1, produced 0.115 mg/g cell dry weight (DCW) lycopene. Through optimization by promoter selection, improving the precursor supply and expanding the Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) pool, ultimately, the lycopene yield of the final optimal strain was 6.146 mg/g DCW with shake flask fermentation and 9.319 mg/g DCW (0.714 g/L) in a 3 L fermenter. The lycopene yield in this study is the highest yield of lycopene in P. pastoris reported to date, which demonstrated the potential of P. pastoris in lycopene synthesis and as a candidate host organism for the synthesis of other high value-added terpenoids.</p></details></div>

Phytophthora cinnamomi is a highly aggressive Phytophthora species associated with the forest decline and responsible for the ink disease in chestnut trees (Castanea sativa Miller), a culture which is extremely important in Europe. This pathogenicity occurs due to the action of several enzymes like the hydrolysis of 1,3-beta-glucans at specific sites by the enzyme endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase. The aim of this work to analyze the heterologous expression in two microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, of an endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase encoded by the gene ENDO1 (AM259651) from P. cinnamomi. Different plasmids were used to clone the gene on each organism and the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine its level of expression. Homologous expression was also analyzed during growth in different carbon sources (glucose, cellulose, and sawdust) and time-course experiments were used for endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase production. The highest expression of the endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase gene occurred in glucose after 8 h of induction. In vivo infection of C. sativa by P. cinnamomi revealed an increase in endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase expression after 12 h. At 24 h its expression decreased and at 48 h there was again a slight increase in expression, and more experiments in order to further explain this fact are underway.</p></details></div>

Mutant chitosanase (m-SsCsn46) and wild chitosanase (SsCsn46) were secretory expressed at high level and purity in Pichia pastoris GS115. The activity of m-SsCsn46 was 30,000 U/mg and reduced by almost 40% of the maximum activity of wild type SsCsn46 (50,000 U/mg). Both enzymes had a high maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 50 degrees C, and maintained 40% of maximum activity at temperature 40-60 degrees C at pH 6.0 and or pH 5-7 at 50 degrees C after 2-hour treatment. The hydrolysis of chitosan by SsCsn46 yielded predominantly chitooligosaccharides with degree of polymerization (DP) 3-5 while m-SsCsn46 preferred to produce chitopentasaccharide from chitosan. Chitopentasaccharide improved gut microbiota significantly (by reducing the proportion of harmful pathogen population and increasing the proportion of the probiotic population) in mice when compared with the chitooligosaccharides with DPs 3-5.

The fusion construct was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris for cost effective and facile production. The purified construct had comparable plasminogen activation and clot lysis capability as compared to native SAK in that it showed plasmin dependent Plasminogen activation, but exhibited significantly lower fibrinogenolysis (an indicator of fibrin-specific action) even at much higher doses than SAK. In addition, its successful activation of the thrombin-mediated Protein C anticoagulant pathway was reflected in increased in vitro plasma clotting time, as well as inhibition of clot bound thrombin, which led to nearly 15-25% lesser re-formation of fibrin clots after initial successful clot lysis in a specially designed in vitro assay for re-occlusion. Thus, this novel chimeric protein could be of high therapeutic potential as a thrombolytic drug with enhanced fibrin specific clot dissolving properties along with lower bleeding and re-thrombosis complications- a dire need today, especially in the treatment of thrombotic strokes.</p></details></div>

As noted with other G-protein-coupled receptor family members, the role of the lipid environment in CCR5 signaling remains obscure and very modestly investigated. Controversial literature on the impact of cholesterol (Chol) depletion in HIV infection and CCR5 signaling, including the hypothesis that Chol depletion could inhibit HIV infection, lead us to focus on the understanding of Chol impact in the first stages of receptor activation. To address this aim, the approach chosen was to employ reconstituted model lipid systems of controlled lipid composition containing CCR5 from two distinct expression systems: Pichia pastoris and cell-free expression. The characterization of receptor/ligand interaction in terms of total binding or competition binding assays was independently performed by plasmon waveguide resonance and fluorescence anisotropy, respectively. Maraviroc, a potent receptor antagonist, was the ligand investigated. Additionally, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation was employed to investigate Chol impact in the receptor-conformational flexibility and dynamics. Results obtained with receptor produced by different expression systems and using different biophysical approaches clearly demonstrate a considerable impact of Chol in the binding affinity of maraviroc to the receptor and receptor-conformational dynamics. Chol considerably decreases maraviroc binding affinity to the CCR5 receptor. The mechanisms by which this effect occurs seem to involve the adoption of distinct receptor-conformational states with restrained structural dynamics and helical motions in the presence of Chol.</p></details></div>

Albumin binding property is exploited to address this issue, as some of the extracorporeal dialysis systems use albumin as dialysate. In this line, a detailed study about binding of PBUTs to human serum albumin (HSA) and its domains gives valuable information. The focus of this work emphasizes the mechanism of binding of HSA and its domains with a few selected PBUTs such as hippuric acid (HA), indole acetic acid (IAA) and melatonin. The HSA domains (D2, D3 and D2-3) were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by using Albupure matrix. The binding of the expressed domains and HSA, with PBUTs, was measured using surface plasmon resonance and analyzed. All the three domains have significant affinity towards PBUTs, while D3 had greater affinity for all the three selected PBUTs. Docking studies showed that the basic amino acid, lysine, was forming hydrogen bond with PUBTs inorder to stabile these complex. This study would be having therapeutic importance for preparing the extracorporeal dialysis systems, in combination of different domains of HSA to remove the PBUTs.</p></details></div>

Cordyceps militaris fibrinolytic enzyme (CmFE) has one open reading frame of 759 bp encoding "pre-pro-protein" of 252 amino acids. Recombinant CmFE was expressed as 28 kDa extracellular enzyme in Pichia pastoris which was capable of degrading fibrin clot. A structure homology model of CmFE was developed using urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The active site contains catalytic triad His41, Asp83, Ser177 and consensus sequence of GDSGG. The substrate binding residues are Asp (171), Gly (194) and Ser (192). Its trypsin-like specificity is determined by the critical Asp171 in S1 subsite. The "oxyanion hole" is formed by backbone amide hydrogen atoms of Gly-175 and Ser-177. CmFE contains six conserved cysteines forming three disulfide linkages. This is the first study describing cloning, expression and prediction of structure-function relationship of a mushroom fibrinolytic protease.

Tetraspanins are transmembrane proteins previously described as potential vaccine candidates for other helminth infections and are also found in the membranes of the tegument and extracellular vesicles of O. viverrini. Here, we investigated the potential of a recombinant protein encoding for the large extracellular loop of O. viverrini tetraspanin-2 (rOv-LEL-TSP-2) in a hamster vaccination model. Hamsters were vaccinated with 50 and 100 mug of rOv-LEL-TSP-2 produced from Pichia pastoris yeast combined with alum CpG adjuvant via the intraperitoneal route. The number of worms recovered from hamsters vaccinated with rOv-LEL-TSP-2 was significantly reduced compared to adjuvant control groups. Fecal egg output was also significantly reduced in vaccinated animals, and the average length of worms recovered from vaccinated animals was significantly shorter than that of the control group. Vaccinated animals showed significantly increased levels of anti-rOv-TSP-2 IgG in the sera after three immunizations, as well as increased levels of several T helper type 1 cytokines in the spleen including IFN-gamma and IL-6 but not the Th2/regulatory cytokines IL-4 or IL-10.

The metabolic performance of this microorganism depends on genetic makeup and culture conditions, amongst which the specific growth rate and oxygenation level are critical. Despite their importance, only their individual effects have been assessed so far, and thus their combined effects and metabolic consequences still remain to be elucidated. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for revealing high-order (i.e., individual and combined) metabolic effects of the above parameters in glucose-limited continuous cultures of P. pastoris, using thaumatin production as a case study. Specifically, we employed a rational experimental design to calculate statistically significant metabolic effects from multiple chemostat data, which were later contextualized using a refined and highly predictive genome-scale metabolic model of this yeast under the simulated conditions. Our results revealed a negative effect of the oxygenation on the specific product formation rate (thaumatin), and a positive effect on the biomass yield. Notably, we identified a novel positive combined effect of both the specific growth rate and oxygenation level on the specific product formation rate. Finally, model predictions indicated an opposite relationship between the oxygenation level and the growth-associated maintenance energy (GAME) requirement, suggesting a linear GAME decrease of 0.56mmol ATP/gDCW per each 1% increase in oxygenation level, which translated into a 44% higher metabolic cost under low oxygenation compared to high oxygenation. Overall, this work provides a systematic framework for mapping high-order metabolic effects of different culture parameters on the performance of a microbial cell factory. Particularly in this case, it provided valuable insights about optimal operational conditions for protein production in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Vplys60 manifested stable activity over broad range of pH (6-10), temperatures (37-75 degrees C) and salinity (100-600mM NaCl). Biochemical and in silico analysis revealed that addition of calcium ion (Ca(2+)) enhanced the lytic activity of Vplys60 whereas other metal ions inhibited the activity. Additionally, calcium-dependent Vplys60 has showed a strong amidase activity by cleaving the peptidoglycan of V. parahaemolyticus. Our data also showed that Vplys60 (75mug/ml) significantly inhibits biofilm formation (91.6%) and significantly reduced the bacterial population. The in vivo challenge study showed enhanced survival rate in combination with reduced vibrio load in Artemia after administration of Pichia-expressing Vplys60.</p></details></div>

In previous studies, we reported on three endothiapepsin-like proteins in the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana; the genes were up-regulated in B. bassiana hyper-virulent strain GXsk1011 at early stage infection in the silkworm. However, whether these proteins play a role in pathogenicity or not remains unknown. In this study, we cloned one protein, BbepnL-1 gene (BBA-07766), that has 98% homology with B. bassiana strain Bb2860, and expressed it in the yeast Pichia pastoris to investigate its function. The endothiapepsin-like protein is a secreted proteinase of molecular weight approximately 40kDa. It has an N-glycosylation site and a mutation in the C-terminal conserved domain- a Thr was mutated to Gly in B. bassiana GXsk1011 and is different than the endothiapepsin of Endothia parasitica. The recombinant endothiapepsin-like protein showed enzyme activity and degraded the protein components of the silkworm cuticle. To further investigate the activity of the endothiapepsin-like protein, we knocked out the gene BbepnL-1 and showed that the loss of BbepnL-1 reduced the virulence in the silkworm. These results demonstrated that the endothiapepsin-like protein of B. bassiana is a virulence factor.</p></details></div>

Although glycosylation is not required for the manifestation of the biological activity of G-CSF, a number of studies have shown that the carbohydrate residue significantly increases the physicochemical stability of the G-CSF molecule. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to design a Pichia pastoris strain capable of producing glycosylated rhG-CSF, and to study its effects on rat bone marrow cells. The nucleotide sequence of the rhG-CSF gene has been optimized for expression in P. pastoris, synthesized, cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector and expressed under the control of the AOX promoter in P. pastoris X33. One of the selected clones secreting rhG-CSF, produced 100-120 mg/l of rhG-CSF three days post-induction with methanol. The recombinant cytokine was purified using two-step, ion-exchange chromatography. The final yield of purified G-CSF was 35 mg/L of culture medium. The biological activity of rhG-CSF was examined in rat bone marrow cells. The P. pastoris strain was designed to produce relatively high levels of rhG-CSF. The rhG-CSF protein had a strong stimulating effect on the growth of rat bone marrow cells, which was comparable to that of the commercial drug leukostim, but showed a more persistent effect on granulocyte cells and monocyte sprouts, enabling the enhanced maintenance of the viability of the cells into the 4th day of incubation.</p></details></div>

Usually, these enzymes do not hydrolyze or present only low activities towards monoglycosylated compounds. The flavonoid degrading fungus Acremonium sp. DSM 24697 produced two diglycosidases, which were termed 6-O-alpha-rhamnosyl-beta-glucosidase I and II (alphaRbetaG I and II) because of their function of releasing the disaccharide rutinose (6-O-alpha-L-rhamnosyl-beta-D-glucose) from the diglycoconjugates hesperidin or rutin. In this work, the genome of Acremonium sp. DSM 24697 was sequenced and assembled with a size of ~ 27 Mb. The genes encoding alphaRbetaG I and II were expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71 and the protein products were purified with apparent molecular masses of 42 and 82 kDa, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis showed that alphaRbetaG I grouped in glycoside hydrolase family 5, subfamily 23 (GH5), together with other fungal diglycosidases whose substrate specificities had been reported to be different from alphaRbetaG I. On the other hand, alphaRbetaG II grouped in glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3) and thus is the first GH3 member that hydrolyzes the heterosidic linkage of rutinosylated compounds. The substrate scopes of the enzymes were different: alphaRbetaG I showed exclusive specificity toward 7-O-beta-rutinosyl flavonoids, whereas alphaRbetaG II hydrolyzed both 7-O-beta-rutinosyl- and 3-O-beta-rutinosyl- flavonoids. None of the enzymes displayed activity toward 7-O-beta-neohesperidosyl- flavonoids. The recombinant enzymes also exhibited transglycosylation activities, transferring rutinose from hesperidin or rutin onto various alcoholic acceptors. The different substrate scopes of alphaRbetaG I and II may be part of an optimized strategy of the original microorganism to utilize different carbon sources.</p></details></div>

Affinity determinations were performed by direct binding with the tritiated agonist DAMGO and antagonist diprenorphine (DIP). Additionally, displacement of these drugs with agonists (morphine and DAMGO) and antagonists (beta-funaltrexamine, naloxone and diprenorphine) was examined. Tritiated DAMGO could bind to membranes prepared from Pp-hMOR, although the receptor was not coupled with G-proteins. The data obtained with this yeast strain suggested that only 7.5% of receptors were in a high-affinity-state conformation. This value was markedly less than that estimated in SH-hMOR membranes, which reached 50%. Finally, to understand the pharmacological discrepancies between Pp-hMOR and SH-hMOR, the role of sterols was evaluated. The major sterol in P. pastoris is ergosterol, while hMOR naturally functions in a cholesterol-containing membrane environment. Cell membranes were sterol-depleted or cholesterol-loaded with methyl-beta-cyclodextrine. The results indicated that cholesterol must be present to ensure Pp-hMOR function. The proportion of high-affinity-state conformation was reversibly increased by cholesterol complementation.</p></details></div>

Accordingly, to reduce biofuel production costs, new microbial strains are needed that can produce highly efficient enzymes on a large scale. Results: We heterologously expressed the fungal beta-glucosidase D2-BGL from a Taiwanese indigenous fungus Chaetomella raphigera in Pichia pastoris for constitutive production by fermentation. Recombinant D2-BGL presented significantly higher substrate affinity than the commercial beta-glucosidase Novozyme 188 (N188; K m = 0.2 vs 2.14 mM for p-nitrophenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside and 0.96 vs 2.38 mM for cellobiose). When combined with RUT-C30 cellulases, it hydrolyzed acid-pretreated lignocellulosic biomasses more efficiently than the commercial cellulase mixture CTec3. The extent of conversion from cellulose to glucose was 83% for sugarcane bagasse and 63% for rice straws. Compared to N188, use of D2-BGL halved the time necessary to produce maximal levels of ethanol by a semi-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. We upscaled production of recombinant D2-BGL to 33.6 U/mL within 15 days using a 1-ton bioreactor. Crystal structure analysis revealed that D2-BGL belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3. Removing the N-glycosylation N68 or O-glycosylation T431 residues by site-directed mutagenesis negatively affected enzyme production in P. pastoris. The F256 substrate-binding residue in D2-BGL is located in a shorter loop surrounding the active site pocket relative to that of Aspergillus beta-glucosidases, and this short loop is responsible for its high substrate affinity toward cellobiose. Conclusions: D2-BGL is an efficient supplement for lignocellulosic biomass saccharification, and we upscaled production of this enzyme using a 1-ton bioreactor. Enzyme production could be further improved using optimized fermentation, which could reduce biofuel production costs. Our structure analysis of D2-BGL offers new insights into GH3 beta-glucosidases, which will be useful for strain improvements via a structure-based mutagenesis approach.</p></details></div>

The alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (BLA) with six potential glycosylation sites possessed excellent thermal and pH stability and high activity. Here, it was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The Pic-BLA-producing yeast without any antibiotics-resistant gene was cultivated in flasks and the amylase activity in fermentation supernatant reached 900 U/mL. The recombinant alpha-amylase Pic-BLA produced in P. pastoris was deeply glycosylated with 30% increase in molecular mass (MM). The deglycosylation treatment by Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) reduced the MM of Pic-BLA. Thermostability analysis showed that Pic-BLA and deglycosylated Pic-BLA were similar in heat tolerance. In order to eliminate the extra impact of Endo H, the BLA was also expressed in Escherichia coli to get non-glycosylated Eco-BLA. A comparative study between non-glycosylated Eco-BLA and glycosylated Pic-BLA showed no obvious difference in thermostability. It is speculated that the glycosylation has little effect on the thermostability of alpha-amylase BLA.</p></details></div>

In both set-ups, no indication for elevated cell lysis was found. The quantitative data revealed that intact and viable P. pastoris cells secrete only a low number of endogenous proteins (in total 51), even during high cell density cultivation. Interestingly, no marked differences in the functional composition of the P. pastoris secretome between methanol- and glucose-grown cultures were observed with only few proteins being specifically affected by the carbon source. The 'core secretome' of 22 proteins present in all analysed carbon sources (glycerol, glucose and methanol) consists mainly of cell wall proteins. The quantitative analysis additionally revealed that most secretome proteins were already present after the batch phase, and depletion rather than accumulation occurred during the fed-batch processes. Among the changes over cultivation time, the depletion of both the extracellularly detected chaperones and the only two identified proteases (Pep4 and Yps1-1) during the methanol- or glucose-feed phase appear as most prominent.</p></details></div>

A. thaliana SOS1 consists of 1146 amino acids, with the first 450 in a N-terminal membrane transport domain and the balance forming a cytosolic regulatory domain. For studies on characterization of the protein, two different constructs of SOS1 comprising of the residues 28 to 460 and 28 to 990 were cloned and overexpressed in methylotropic yeast strain of Pichia pastoris with a C-terminal histidine tag using the expression vector pPICZA. Styrene malic acid copolymers (SMA) were used as a cost-effective alternative to detergent for solubilization and isolation of this membrane protein. Immobilized Ni(2+)-ion affinity chromatography was used to purify the expressed protein resulting in a yield of ~0.6-2mg of SOS1 per liter of Pichia pastoris culture. The SMA purified protein containing amino acids 28 to 990 was directly reconstituted into liposomes for determination of Na(+) transport activity and was functionally active. However, similar reconstitution with amino acids 28-460 did not yield a functional protein. Other results have shown that the truncated SOS1 protein at amino acid 481 is active, which infers the presence of an element between residues 461-481 which is necessary for SOS1 activity.

For this purpose, K. phaffii clones constitutively expressing (PGAP ) Candida rugosa lipase 1 (Crl1) with different gene dosage were used as models in continuous and fed-batch cultures. Production parameters were much greater with a multicopy clone (MCC) than with the single-copy clone (SCC). Regarding production kinetics, the specific product generation rate (qP ) increased linearly with increasing specific growth rate (micro) in SCC; by contrast, qP exhibited saturation in MCC. A transcriptional analysis in chemostat cultures suggested the presence of eventual post-transcriptional bottlenecks in MCC. After the strain characterization, in order to fulfil overall development of the bioprocess, the performance of both clones was also evaluated in fed-batch mode. Strikingly, different optimal strategies were determined for both models due to the different production kinetic patterns observed as a trade-off for product titre, yields and productivity.

Transferring two beneficial mutations identified in X-33 into Y-11430 resulted in an optimized base strain that provided up to four-fold higher transformation efficiency and three-fold higher protein titers, while retaining robust growth. The approach employed here to assess unique banked variants in a species and then transfer key beneficial variants into a base strain should also facilitate rational assessment of a broad set of other recombinant hosts.</p></details></div>

Forty-days-old female quails were divided into three treatments: T1 (Control) received a basal diet without P. pastoris; T2 (Pichia Effluent) received a basal diet supplemented with P. pastoris grown in parboiled rice effluent and biodiesel glycerol, and T3 (Pichia YPD) received a basal diet supplemented with P. pastoris produced in YPD. The birds were vaccinated against Newcastle Disease (NDV), Avian Infectious Bronchitis (IBV), and Gumboro Disease on days 1 and 28. The following parameters were analyzed: performance, egg quality, humoral immune response to the vaccines, organ weight, and intestinal morphometry. P. pastoris grown in YPD increased egg weight (p < 0.05). The lowest liver weight on day 14 was obtained in Pichia Effluent, whereas both P. pastoris supplemented groups had the lowest duodenum weights on day 14. Besides that, livers and duodenums presented no morphological changes in any of the three treatments. Supplementation of P. pastoris modulated the immune system of the birds, increasing anti-IBV, anti-NDV, and anti-Gumboro antibodies levels compared to the Control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, quail's immune response was improved by Pichia pastoris X-33, either it was grown in YPD or industrial residues, and the egg weight increased with Pichia pastoris X-33 grown in YPD, thereby demonstrating to be a promising probiotic for poultry.</p></details></div>

Through high cell density fermentation, the maximum yield reached 11,600U/mL and 15.5g/L, which is higher than most extreme beta-mannanases. The recombinant ManAK was thermostable with a temperature optimum of 80 degrees C, and acid tolerant with a pH optimum of 2.0. ManAK could efficiently degrade locust bean gum, konjac gum, and guar gum into small molecular mannooligosaccharide (<2000Da), even at high initial substrate concentration (10%), and displayed different Mw distributions in their end products. Docking analysis demonstrated that the catalytic pocket of ManAK could only accommodate a galactopyranosyl residue in subsite -1, which might be responsible for the distinct hydrolysis product compositions from locust bean gum and guar gum.

In this study, six novel extracellular alpha-galactosidases from Penicillium subrubescens were produced in Pichia pastoris and characterized. All alpha-galactosidases exhibited high affinity to pNPalphaGal, and only AglE was not active towards galacto-oligomers. Especially AglB and AglD released high amounts of galactose from guar gum, carob galactomannan and locust bean, but combining alpha-galactosidases with an endomannanase dramatically improved galactose release. Structural comparisons to other alpha-galactosidases and homology modelling showed high sequence similarities, albeit significant differences in mechanisms of productive binding, including discrimination between various galactosides. To our knowledge, this is the first study of such an extensive repertoire of extracellular fungal alpha-galactosidases, to demonstrate their potential for degradation of galactomannan-rich biomass. These findings contribute to understanding the differences within glycoside hydrolase families, to facilitate the development of new strategies to generate tailor-made enzymes for new industrial bioprocesses.</p></details></div>

The amount of BbCSN-1 in the fermentation broth of P. pastoris gradually increased after induction with methanol from one to 6d, reaching 398mug/ml on the 6th day. The molecular characteristics of BbCSN-1 were measured with colloidal chitosan as a substrate.

However, the characteristics of this fungus have not yet been determined. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the molecular characteristics and natural substrate specificity of the Pcfae1 gene from Penicillium chrysogenum and examined its synergistic effects on sugar beet pectin. The Pcfae1 gene was cloned and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris KM71H, and the recombinant enzyme, named PcFAE1, was characterized. The 505 amino acids of PcFAE1 possessed a GCSTG motif (Gly164 to Gly168), characteristic of the serine esterase family. By comparing the amino acid sequence of PcFAE1 with that of the FAE (AoFaeB) of Aspergillus oryzae, Ser166, Asp379, and His419 were identified as the catalytic triad. PcFAE1 was purified through two steps using anion-exchange column chromatography. Its molecular mass without the signal peptide was 75kDa. Maximum PcFAE1 activity was achieved at pH 6.0-7.0 and 50 degrees C. The enzyme was stable up to 37 degrees C and at a pH range of 3-8. PcFAE1 activity was only inhibited by Hg(2+), and the enzyme had activity toward methyl FA, methyl caffeic acid, and methyl p-coumaric acid, with specific activities of 6.97, 4.65, and 9.32 U/mg, respectively, but not on methyl sinapinic acid. These results indicated that PcFAE1 acted similar to FaeB type according the Crepin classification. PcFAE1 de-esterified O-[6-O-feruloyl-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)]-d-galactopyranose, O-[2-O-feruloyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->5)]-l-arabinofuranose, and O-[5-O-feruloyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->3)]-O-beta-d-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)- d-xylopyranose, indicating that the enzyme could de-esterify FAs decorated with both beta-d-galactopyranosidic and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidic residues in pectin and xylan. PcFAE1 acted in synergy with endo-alpha-1,5-arabinanase and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase, which releases FA linked to arabinan, to digest the sugar beet pectin. Moreover, when PcFAE1 was allowed to act on sugar beet pectin together with Driselase, approximately 90% of total FA in the substrate was released. Therefore, PcFAE1 may be an interesting candidate for hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials and could have applications as a tool for production of FA from natural substrates.</p></details></div>

Upon oxidative degradation of (+)-ambrein, several fragrance molecules are formed, amongst them (-)-ambrox, one of the highest valued compounds in the perfume industry. In order to generate a Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of (+)-ambrein, intracellular supply of the squalene was enhanced by overexpression of two central enzymes in the mevalonate and sterol biosynthesis pathway, namely the N-terminally truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase 1 (tHMG) and the squalene synthase (ERG9). In addition, another key enzyme in sterol biosynthesis, squalene epoxidase (ERG1) was inhibited by an experimentally defined amount of the inhibitor terbinafine in order to reduce flux of squalene towards ergosterol biosynthesis while retaining sufficient activity to maintain cell viability and growth. Heterologous expression of a promiscuous variant of Bacillus megaterium tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene cyclase (BmeTC-D373C), which has been shown to be able to catalyse the conversion of squalene to 3-deoxyachillol and then further to (+)-ambrein resulted in production of these triterpenoids in S. cerevisiae for the first time. Triterpenoid yields are comparable with the best microbial production chassis described in literature so far, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Consequently, we discuss similarities and differences of these two yeast species when applied for whole-cell (+)-ambrein production.</p></details></div>

It has short serum half-life, therefore, to maintain its therapeutic level in the human body it requires thrice-weekly administration. Various strategies like PEGylation and micro-encapsulation have been developed during the last few years to enhance the pharmacokinetics of small therapeutic peptides. This study executed the human albumin-fusion technology, a simple and flexible approach to extend the serum circulating half-life of cIFN, because human serum albumin (HSA) has long circulating half-life (19 days) and very minute immunological activities. We integrated the codon-optimized HSA-cIFN fusion gene into Pichia pastoris genome by homologous recombination. The selection of hyper-resistant P. pastoris clone against Zeocin achieved a high-level secretory expression (250mg/L) of fusion protein. HSA-cIFN fusion protein was purified using one-step purification by affinity chromatography with 34% recovery. The SDS-PAGE and SEC-HPLC analysis confirmed the final purified product has molecular weight of 87kDa with 98% purity. Western blot analysis using anti-IFN antibodies further verified the purified HSA-cIFN fusion protein. The specific biological activity was 2.1x10(6) IU/mg as assessed by cytopathic inhibition assay, and half-life of fusion protein was estimated by in vitro thermal and proteolytic stability studies. This work concludes that by using albumin fusion technology, codon optimization and one-step purification a high yield of 86mg/L of biologically active protein with improved serum half-life was obtained.</p></details></div>

Although there is comprehensive knowledge about methanol metabolism, there are other mechanisms in P. pastoris that have not been investigated yet, such as ethanol metabolism. The gene responsible for the consumption of ethanol ADH2 (XM_002491337, known as ADH3) was identified and characterized in our previous study. In this study, the ADH genes (XM_002489969, XM_002491163, XM_002493969) in P. pastoris genome were investigated to determine their roles in ethanol production by gene disruption analysis. We report that the ADH900 (XM_002491163) is the main gene responsible for ethanol production in P. pastoris. The ADH2 gene, previously identified as the only gene responsible for ethanol consumption, also plays a minor role in ethanol production in the absence of the ADH900 gene. The investigation of the carbon source regulation mechanism has also revealed that the ADH2 gene exhibit similar expression behaviours with ADH900 on glucose, glycerol, and methanol, however, it is strongly induced by ethanol.</p></details></div>

Because P. pastoris secretes few of its own proteins, the exported recombinant protein is the major polypeptide in the extracellular medium, making purification relatively easy. Unfortunately, some recombinant proteins intended for secretion are retained within the cell. A mutant strain isolated in our laboratory, containing a disruption of the BGS13 gene, displayed elevated levels of secretion for a variety of reporter proteins. The Bgs13 peptide (Bgs13p) is similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase C 1 protein (Pkc1p), but its specific mode of action is currently unclear. To illuminate differences in the secretion mechanism between the wild-type (wt) strain and the bgs13 strain, we determined that the disrupted bgs13 gene expressed a truncated protein that had reduced protein kinase C activity and a different location in the cell, compared to the wt protein. Because the Pkc1p of baker's yeast plays a significant role in cell wall integrity, we investigated the sensitivity of the mutant strain's cell wall to growth antagonists and extraction by dithiothreitol, determining that the bgs13 strain cell wall suffered from inherent structural problems although its porosity was normal. A proteomic investigation of the bgs13 strain secretome and cell wall-extracted peptides demonstrated that, compared to its wt parent, the bgs13 strain also displayed increased release of an array of normally secreted, endogenous proteins, as well as endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone proteins, suggesting that Bgs13p helps regulate the unfolded protein response and protein sorting on a global scale.IMPORTANCE The yeast Pichia pastoris is used as a host system for the expression of recombinant proteins. Many of these products, including antibodies, vaccine antigens, and therapeutic proteins such as insulin, are currently on the market or in late stages of development. However, one major weakness is that sometimes these proteins are not secreted from the yeast cell efficiently, which impedes and raises the cost of purification of these vital proteins. Our laboratory has isolated a mutant strain of Pichia pastoris that shows enhanced secretion of many proteins. The mutant produces a modified version of Bgs13p. Our goal is to understand how the change in the Bgs13p function leads to improved secretion. Once the Bgs13p mechanism is illuminated, we should be able to apply this understanding to engineer new P. pastoris strains that efficiently produce and secrete life-saving recombinant proteins, providing medical and economic benefits.</p></details></div>

Herein, the discovery of unique hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) from two species of passion fruits, Passiflora edulis forma flavicarpa (yellow passion fruit, PeHNL-Ny) and Passiflora edulis Sims (purple passion fruit, PeHNL-Np), isolated and purified from passion fruit leaves is reported. These are the smallest HNLs (comprising 121 amino acids). Amino acid sequences of both enzymes are 99 % identical; there is a difference of one amino acid in a consensus sequence. PeHNL-Np has an Ala residue at position 107 and is nonglycosylated at Asn105. Because it was confirmed that natural and glycosylated PeHNL-Ny showed superior thermostability, pH stability, and organic tolerance to that of PeHNL-Np, it has been speculated that protein engineering around the only glycosylation site, Asn105, located at the C-terminal region of PeHNL-Ny, might contribute to the stabilization of PeHNL. Therefore, the focus is on improved stability of the nonglycosylated PeHNL by truncating its C-terminal region. The C-terminal-truncated PeHNLDelta107 was obtained by truncating 15 amino acids from the C terminus followed by expression in Escherichia coli. PeHNLDelta107 expressed in E. coli was not glycosylated, and showed improved thermostability, solvent stability, and reusability similar to that of the wild-type glycosylated form of PeHNL expressed in Pichia pastoris. These data reveal that the lack of the high-flexibility region at the C terminus of PeHNL might be a possible reason for improving the stability of PeHNL.</p></details></div>

Conformational changes upon Ab binding were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance using a 7A1-single-chain variable fragment. In addition, a human IgE Ab construct that interferes with mAb 7A1 binding was isolated from a combinatorial phage-display library constructed from a mite-allergic patient and expressed as two recombinant forms (single-chain Fab in Pichia pastoris and Fab in Escherichia coli).

The basis of the effect of N-glycosylation on yield, however, has not been elucidated. In order to investigate the effect of N-glycosylation on heterologous protein production, site-directed mutation was performed on five potential N-glycosylation sites of the tetanus toxin fragment C (TetC). Unaltered TetC (wild-TetC) and eight mutants, in which different numbers and locations of N-glycosylation sites were altered, were expressed in P. pastoris GS115. The recombinant target proteins presented different levels of N-glycosylation. The wild Tet-C and 4 mutations sites of putative N-glycosylation (4Gly mutant: N280Q) had the highest level of secreted protein, while 1 mutation of putative N-glycosylation sites (1Gly mutant: N39/64/85/205Q) had the highest level of intracellular, non-secreted heterologous protein. Reducing the number of native N-glycosylation sites decreased the level of glycosylation, as well as the level of secretion. Introduction of a N-glycosylation site at position 320, however, also reduced the level of expression and secretion of recombinant protein. These results indicate that the number and location of N-glycosylation sites jointly have an effect on the expression and secretion of heterologous glycoproteins in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Robust and cost-effective methods have been developed for site specific protein (1)H/(13)C methyl labeling in an otherwise deuterated background in bacteria. However, bacterial systems are not suitable for expression and isotope labeling of many eukaryotic and membrane proteins. The yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) is a commonly used host for expression of eukaryotic proteins, and site-specific methyl labeling of perdeuterated eukaryotic proteins has recently been achieved with this system. However, the practical utility of methyl labeling and deuteration in P. pastoris is limited by high costs. Here, we describe an improved method for (1)H/(13)C-labeling of the delta-methyl group of isoleucine residues in a perdeuterated background, which reduces the cost by >/= 50% without compromising the efficiency of isotope enrichment. We have successfully implemented this method to label actin and a G-protein coupled receptor.

The current PRRS inactivated vaccine only confers limited protection against PRRSV. Thus, using an appropriate adjuvant via a suitable administration route may help improve vaccine efficacy. In this study, the recombinant B subunit of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin rLTB, was highly expressed in Pichia pastoris, through high-density fermentation. rLTB intranasal adjuvant properties were evaluated on an inactivated PRRS antigen in mice. Compared to the group immunized with solely PRRS antigen, a dose of 50 microg rLTB remarkably raised antigen-specific IgA antibodies at mucosal sites, and increased serum IgG antibodies, preferentially the IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses. Further, rLTB induced increases in Th1- (IFN-gamma and IL-12) and Th17 (IL-6) cytokine profiles, but had little effect on Th2 cytokine profiles (IL-4 and IL-10). Moreover, there were no overt toxicities associated with intranasal rLTB administration. Our data provide evidence that the rLTB produced by P. pastoris fermentation portrays low toxicity, and its intranasal adjuvant effect involves immune system modulation to a Th1 profile.</p></details></div>

This study cloned a new crustin from Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, which we designated as LvCrustinB, using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of LvCrustinB is 751 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 591 bp encoding a peptide of 196 amino acids that includes a putative signal sequence. LvCrustinB is a type II crustin that has a glycine-rich region and a single whey acidic protein domain (WAP) domain. The mRNA transcript of LvCrustinB was detected in all examined tissues and was found to be most abundantly expressed in the epithelium and muscle. The expression of LvCrustinB in hemocytes was significantly upregulated after L. vannamei was challenged with LPS, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). When LvCrustinB was knocked down with RNAi, the mortality rate of L. vannamei significantly increased after V. parahaemolyticus or WSSV infection. Recombinant LvCrustinB was produced using Pichia pastoris GS115 and was shown to bind to 2g-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and 2g-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and V. parahaemolyticus) via polysaccharides, which included PGN, LTA, and LPS. In vivo, the recombinant LvCrustinB remarkably protected L. vannamei from V. parahaemolyticus infection.

H2O2 is a signaling molecule that partakes in immune responses where its transport is mediated by aquaporins. To shed further light on the molecular basis of the aquaporin function in H2O2 transport, we have characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana aquaporin, AtPIP2;4, recombinantly produced to high yields in Pichia pastoris. Here, we present a newly established assay that allows detection of H2O2 transport by purified aquaporins reconstituted into liposomes, enabling us to compare aquaporin homologues with respect to substrate specificity. To get additional insight into the structural determinants for aquaporin-mediated H2O2 transport, we solved the 3D-structure of AtPIP2;4 to 3.7A resolution and found structural identity to the water channel from spinach (SoPIP2;1), with the difference that Cd(2+) cation is not required to retain the closed conformation. The transport specificities of the two plant aquaporins were compared to a human homologue, AQP1. Overall, we conclude that AtPIP2;4, SoPIP2;1 and hAQP1 are all transporters of both H2O and H2O2, but have different efficiencies for various specificities. Notably, all three homologues expedite H2O transport equally well while the plant aquaporins are more permeable to H2O2 than hAQP1. Comparison of the structures indicates that the observed variations in H2O and H2O2 transport cannot be explained by differences in the monomeric pore. Possibly, the determinants for transport specificities reside in the flexible domains outside the membrane core of these channels.</p></details></div>

They occur in every kingdom of life and catalyse a variety of essential reactions. Their production is of utmost interest regarding biotransformation and structure-function elucidation. However, they have proven hard to express due to their membrane anchor, their complex co-factor requirements and their need for a redox-partner. In our study, we investigated and compared different yeast strains for the production of the plant cytochrome P450 chalcone 3-hydroxylase. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating different yeasts for the expression of this abundant and highly significant protein superfamily. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and three different strains of Pichia pastoris expressing chalcone 3-hydroxylase were cultivated in controlled bioreactor runs and evaluated regarding physiological parameters and expression levels of the cytochrome P450. Production differed significantly between the different strains and was found highest in the investigated P. pastoris MutS strain KM71H where 8 mg P450 per gram dry cell weight were detected. We believe that this host could be suitable for the expression of many eukaryotic, especially plant-derived, cytochrome P450s as it combines high specific product yields together with straightforward cultivation techniques for achieving high biomass concentrations. Both factors greatly facilitate subsequent establishment of purification procedures for the cytochrome P450 and make the yeast strain an ideal platform for biotransformation as well.</p></details></div>

Sixty mares seronegative for theileriosis were divided in two groups, one vaccinated and another group as a control animal. Mice and mares of the vaccinated groups were inoculated with 150muL of the vaccine containing 50mug of rEMA-2 and 2mL of the vaccine containing 200mug of rEMA-2, respectively, at days 0 and 21. The immunogenicity of rEMA-2 was evaluated by ELISA and fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) using serum from vaccinated mice, mares and antigenicity in naturally infected horse. At every point throughout the ELISA study, there were significant differences between the vaccinated and control groups (p<0.05). The vaccine induced 3- and 4-fold IgG increases in mice at the 14th and 28th day, respectively, compared to the control group. The horses' IgG dynamics showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in the total IgG titer as early as day 7, which increased until day 28at which time a more significant (p<0.001) IgG titer was observed. In evaluating the isotypes, we observed a trend similar to that of total IgG, where IgG(T) (IgG3-5) were significantly (p<0.05) more elevated than the other isotypes analyzed, followed by IgGb (IgG4-7) and IgGa (IgG1). Positive fluorescence was detected by IFAT, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and conserves some epitopes identical to the native T. equi antigens present in the equine blood smear. Thus, our results suggest that rEMA-2 can be a promising vaccinal antigen.</p></details></div>

Vaccination is currently considered the best strategy to prevent R. anatipestifer infection in ducklings. In this study, we fused the duck IgY Fc gene to the outer membrane protein A (ompA) of R. anatipestifer. The eukaryotic expression plasmid carrying the fusion gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) to express the recombinant ompA and ompA-Fc proteins. Then, the effects of fused Fc on the vitality and antigen processing efficiency of duck peritoneal macrophages (PMo) were evaluated in vitro, whereas their immunogenicity was evaluated in vivo. Furthermore, Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (SCP) was used to evaluate its immune-conditioning effects on the activation of PMo. SCP was also used as adjuvant to investigate immunomodulation on immunoresponses induced by the fused ompA-Fc in ducklings. The conventional Freund's incomplete adjuvant served as the control of SCP. Notably, ompA-Fc promoted phagocytosis of PMo and significantly increased serum antibody titers, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte transformation rate, and serum levels of IL-2 and IL-4. In addition, ducklings injected with the ompA-Fc vaccine exhibited considerably greater resistance to the R. anatipestifer challenge than those that received vaccines based on standalone ompA. Of note, SCP was demonstrated to boost the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-beta by duck macrophages. In addition, the supplementation of SCP adjuvant to the ompA-Fc vaccines led to the further enhancement of immune response and vaccine protection. The dose of 200mug/mL showed the most pronounced effects. This study provided valuable insights into protective strategies against R. anatipestifer infection.</p></details></div>

The purified recombinant enzyme (rLamC27) with a calculated molecular mass of 45.3kDa displays activities toward a broad range of beta-linked polysaccharides, including laminarin, curdlan, pachyman, lichenan, and CMC. Enzymological characterization showed that rLamC27 performes its optimal activity under the condition of 45 degrees C and pH 7.0, respectively, and preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucans with a beta-1,3-linkage, which is similar to the LamC previously expressed in E. coli. TherLamC27 enzyme was activated by Mn(2+) and Ba(2+), while it was inhibited by Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Co(2+). Moreover, rLamC27 was strongly inhibited by 10mM EDTA with 7.5% of its original activity remiaining, and weakly by SDS and Triton X-100. In antifungal assay, rLamC27 was conformed to possess lytic and antifungal activity against rice blast fungus. Specifically, a significant decrease germ tube and appressorium formation ratios from 94% to 59% and 97%-51%, respectively, were observed following exposure to rLamC27.

Compared to standard methanol induction, sorbitol/methanol (1:1, C-mol/C-mol) mixed induction improved cellular viability from 92.8+/-0.3% to 97.7+/-0.1% although resulted in a reduced product yield from 1.65+/-0.03gL(-1) to 1.12+/-0.07gL(-1). On the other hand, average oxygen consumption rate (OUR) dropped from 241.4+/-21.3mmolL(-1)h(-1) to 145.5+/-6.7mmolL(-1)h(-1). Cell diameter decreased over time in the mixed induction, resulting in a D50 value of 3.14mum at harvest compared to 3.85mum with methanol. The reduction in cell size enhanced the maximum dewatering efficiency from 78.1+/-3.9% to 84.5+/-3.3% as evaluated by using an established ultra scale-down methodology that models pilot and industrial scale disc stack centrifugation. Seventy host cell proteins (HCPs) were identified in clarified supernatant when using sorbitol/methanol mixed induction regimen. The total number of HCPs identified with standard methanol induction was nearly one hundred. The downstream process advantage of the mixed induction lies in improved product purity by reducing both cell mortality and level of released whole cell proteins. This needs to be balanced and optimised against the observed reduction in product yield during fermentation.</p></details></div>

This study identified a novel pectate lyase gene (plhy1) from the thermophilic cellulolytic fungus H. insolens Y1 and tested its ability to produce pectin oligosaccharides. The recombinant PLHY1 produced in Pichia pastoris was superior to other similar enzymes due to its high thermal and pH stability. PLHY1 demonstrated optimal enzymatic activity at 55 degrees C and pH 10.0 in the presence of 0.4 mM Ca(2+), and preferred methyl esterified substrates for digestion. High performance anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detector and ultra high performance liquid chromatography in combination with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that galacturonic acid-oligosaccharides with a small degree of polymerization (4-6) were the major hydrolysates produced by the degradation of apple peel pectin by PLHY1.

While these systems offer sophisticated capabilities to screen batch processes, they lack the ability to realize fed-batch processes, which are used more frequently in industrial bioprocessing. In this study, a novel approach to realize a feedback-regulated enzyme-based slow-release system (FeedER), allowing exponential fed-batch for microscale cultivations, was realized by extending our existing Mini Pilot Plant technology with a customized process control system. By continuously comparing the experimental growth rates with predefined set points, the automated dosage of Amyloglucosidase enzyme for the cleavage of dextrin polymers into D-glucose monomers is triggered. As a prerequisite for stable fed-batch operation, a constant pH is maintained by automated addition of ammonium hydroxide. We show the successful application of FeedER to study fed-batch growth of different industrial model organisms including Corynebacterium glutamicum, Pichia pastoris, and Escherichia coli. Moreover, the comparative analysis of a C. glutamicum GFP producer strain, cultivated under microscale batch and fed-batch conditions, revealed two times higher product yields under slow growing fed-batch operation. In summary, FeedER enables to run 48 parallel fed-batch experiments in an automated and miniaturized manner, and thereby accelerates industrial bioprocess development at the screening stage.</p></details></div>

The recombinant TtFAEB was purified by affinity chromatography and the specific activity of purified TtFAEB was 6.06 +/- 0.72 U/mg. The optimal temperature and pH for purified recombinant TtFAEB was 60 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. TtFAEB was thermostable, retaining 96.89 and 84.16% of the maximum activity after being treated for 1 h at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the enzyme was stable in the pH range 4.5-8.0. The homology model of TtFAEB showed that it consists of a single domain adopting a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser117, Asp201, and His260. TtFAEB in association with xylanase from Trichoderma reesei could release 77.1% of FA from destarched wheat bran.

In this paper, we applied droplet-based method to screen directed evolved extracellular xylanase producing P. pastoris strain. Xylanase-producing P. pastoris cells were encapsulated in gel microdroplets with a fluorogenic reporter substrate. Improved production of xylanase increases fluorescence intensity of gel microdroplets, enabled accurate selection of evolved clones by droplet sorting.

Their effects were investigated using three reporter proteins: yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP), beta-galactosidase (Gal) and cephalosporin C acylase (SECA), in comparison with the commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-mating factor pre-pro leader sequence (alpha-MF) or folding factors (Pdi1p, BiP, and Hac1p). The newly identified signal sequences were superior over alpha-MF for production of heterologous proteins. The signal peptide Msb2 increased the specific extracellular production of all reporter proteins, ranging from 1.5- to 8.0-fold, and Dan4 enhanced all total protein production up to 172-fold. Co-expression of folding factors exhibited a protein-specific effect on cell growth, transcription and expression of different reporter genes.

Glycosylation may play a role in regulating the Lcc9 specific activity. To elucidate this hypothesis, in this study, firstly we demonstrated that rLcc9 and nLcc9 were glycoproteins, and then enzymatically deglycosylated them. The obtained drLcc9 and dnLcc9 showed an apparent decrease in their specific activities. Three putative N-glycosylation sites (N293, N313, and N454) were then predicted in Lcc9 and substituted to evaluate their roles in its specific activity. Molecular weight analysis on those mutants suggested that glycosylation should have occurred on N313 and N454 whereas not on N293 in rLcc9. Comparison of catalytic properties of those mutants revealed that glycosylation at N313 and N454 in rLcc9 could affect the binding affinity to substrates and the catalytic rate, respectively. In addition, the glycosylation could also affect the thermal stability of rLcc9 and nLcc9 since deglycosylation of those Lcc9s resulted in decreases in their thermal stability to some extent. These results will help us to understand the effect of glycosylation on biochemical characteristics of fungal laccases, and provide us support for the improvement of fungal laccase activity based on N-linked glycosylation modification.</p></details></div>

Evaluation of different induction strategies indicated that it was possible to increase Pgp expression by inducing the culture with 20% media containing 2.5% methanol. By quantifying methanol, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and formate, and by measuring alcohol oxidase, catalase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases, it was possible to correlate Pgp expression to the induction strategy. Inducing the culture by adding methanol with fresh media was associated with decreases in formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, and increases in formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases. At these conditions, Pgp expression was 1400-fold higher, an indication that Pgp expression is affected by increases in formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. It is possible that Pgp is responsible for this behaviour, since the increased metabolite concentrations and decreased enzymatic activities were not observed when parental Pichia was subjected to the same growth conditions.

In yeasts, pexophagy depends mostly on the pexophagy receptors, such as Atg30 for Pichia pastoris and Atg36 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the autophagy scaffold proteins, Atg11 and Atg17, and the core autophagy machinery. In P. pastoris, the receptors for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) include the PTS1 receptor, Pex5, and the PTS2 receptor and co-receptor, Pex7 and Pex20, respectively. These shuttling receptors are predominantly cytosolic and only partially peroxisomal. It remains unresolved as to whether, when and how the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal receptors, as well as the peroxisomal matrix proteins, are degraded under pexophagy conditions. These cytosolic pools exist both in normal and mutant cells impaired in peroxisome biogenesis. We report here that Pex5 and Pex7, but not Pex20, are degraded by an Atg30-independent, selective autophagy pathway. To enter this selective autophagy pathway, Pex7 required its major PTS2 cargo, Pot1. Similarly, the degradation of Pex5 was inhibited in cells missing abundant PTS1 cargoes, such as alcohol oxidases and Fox2 (hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase). Furthermore, in cells deficient in PTS receptors, the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal matrix proteins, such as Pot1 and Fox2, were also removed by Atg30-independent, selective autophagy, under pexophagy conditions. In summary, the cytosolic pools of PTS receptors and their cargoes are degraded via a pexophagy-independent, selective autophagy pathway under pexophagy conditions. These autophagy pathways likely protect cells from futile enzymatic reactions that could potentially cause the accumulation of toxic cytosolic products.Abbreviations:</p><p><strong> ATG:</strong> autophagy related; Cvt: cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; Fox2: hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase;</p><p><strong> PAGE:</strong> polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pot1: thiolase;</p><p><strong> PMP:</strong> peroxisomal membrane protein; Pgk1: 3-phosphoglycerate kinase;</p><p><strong> PTS:</strong> peroxisomal targeting signal;</p><p><strong> RADAR:</strong> receptor accumulation and degradation in the absence of recycling;</p><p><strong> RING:</strong> really interesting new gene;</p><p><strong> SDS:</strong> sodium dodecyl sulphate; TCA, trichloroacetic acid; Ub: ubiquitin;</p><p><strong> UPS:</strong> ubiquitin-proteasome system Vid: vacuole import and degradation.</p></details></div>

It typically requires the construction of an expression vector in Escherichia coli containing the foreign gene and its subsequent transformation into yeast. Although simple, this procedure has important limitations for the expression of large numbers of proteins, that is, for the generation of protein libraries. We describe here the development of a novel system for the easy and fast expression of heterologous proteins both in S. cerevisiae and in P. pastoris, under the control of the GAL1 and AOX1 promoters respectively. Expression in S. cerevisiae requires only the transformation of yeast cells with an unpurified PCR product carrying the gene to be expressed, and the expression of the same gene in P. pastoris requires only the isolation of the plasmid generated in S. cerevisiae and its transformation into this second yeast, thus making this system suitable for high-throughput projects. The system has been tested by the extracellular expression of 30 secretory fungal proteins.</p></details></div>
