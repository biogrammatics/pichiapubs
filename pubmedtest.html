Areas covered: This review provides general and patent-oriented insights into production of biopharmaceuticals by yeasts. Patents, wherever possible, were correlated to the original or review articles. The review describes applications of major GRAS (generally regarded as safe) yeasts for the production of therapeutic proteins and subunit vaccines; additionally, immunomodulatory properties of yeast cell wall components were reviewed for use of whole yeast cells as a new vaccine platform. The second part of the review will discuss yeast- humanization strategies and innovative applications. Expert Opinion: Biomedical applications of yeasts were initiated by utilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for production of leavened (fermented) products, and advanced to serve to produce biopharmaceuticals. Higher biomass production and expression/secretion yields, more similarity of glycosylation patterns to mammals and possibility of host-improvement strategies through application of synthetic biology might enhance selection of Pichia pastoris (instead of S. cerevisiae) as a host for production of biopharmaceutical in future. Immunomodulatory properties of yeast cell wall beta-glucans and possibility of intracellular expression of heterologous pathogen/tumor antigens in yeast cells have expanded their application as a new platform, "Whole Yeast Vaccines".</p></details><hr><h4>Fusion of plectasin derivative NZ2114 with hydrophilic random coil polypeptide: Recombinant production in Pichia pastoris and antimicrobial activity against clinical strain MRSA.</h4><p>L. A. Lima et al., Biopolymers   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608428>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>One of the roadblocks towards the practical use of antimicrobial peptides for medical use is their relatively high cost when synthesized chemically. Effective recombinant production has only been successful in some cases, such as the previously reported production in Pichia pastoris of the antimicrobial plectasin derivative peptide NZ2114. The same production host has also been used extensively to produce so-called protein-polymers: sequences that consist of repetitions of simple amino acid motifs found in structural proteins such as collagen and elastin, and that can be designed to self-assemble in micelles, fibers and hydrogels. With the eventual goal of producing recombinant biomaterials such as antimicrobial protein polymer, we here explore the secreted production in Pichia pastoris of a fusion of NZ2114 with a hydrophilic random coil protein polymer CP4 . The intact NZ2114-CP4 fusion copolymer was produced with a yield of purified protein on the order of 1 g.L-1 supernatant. We find that purified NZ2114-CP4 has an activity against clinical strain MRSA, but very much lower than activity of chemically synthesized NZ2114. We conclude that possibly, the activity of NZ2114 is impaired by the C-terminal attachment to the protein polymer chain, but other reasons for the low activity cannot yet be excluded either.

Zhang et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606662>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Botrytis cinerea BcSpl1 protein is a member of the cerato-platanin family, and consists of 137 amino acids and two disulfide bridges. This protein induces the onset of necrosis in infiltrated plant hosts. Recombinant BcSpl1 proteins produced in Pichia pastoris (pBcSpl1) and Escherichia coli (eBcSpl1) were initially compared regarding their abilities to induce necrosis and systemic acquired resistance. The pBcSpl1 and eBcSpl1 treatments led to the development of necrotic lesions on tomato leaves, and provided tomato plants with resistance to B. cinerea. The lesion area of leaves infiltrated with the BcSpl1 proteins decreased by 22.7% (pBcSpl1) and 21.8% (eBcSpl1). Additionally, eBcSpl1 up-regulated the expression levels of some defense-related genes, including PR-1a, prosystemin, PI I, and PI II, as well as SIPK and TPK1b, which encode protein kinases. Furthermore, eBcSpl1 exhibited chitin-binding properties. Our data revealed that the E. coli expression system produces higher BcSpl1 yields than the P. pastoris system. This high-yield expression of BcSpl1 may be relevant for future large-scale applications of this elicitor to improve crop production.</p></details><hr><h4>ATP Sulfurylase is Essential for the Utilization of Sulfamate as a Sulfur Source in the Yeast Komagataella pastoris (syn. Pichia pastoris).</h4><p>T. Linder, Curr Microbiol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28603806>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The methylotrophic yeast Komagataella pastoris (syn. Pichia pastoris) is one of the few known yeasts that can utilize sulfamate ([Formula: see text]) as a sulfur source. The biochemical pathway responsible for the catabolism of sulfamate has yet to be identified. The present study sought to investigate whether sulfamate catabolism proceeds through either of the inorganic sulfur intermediates sulfate ([Formula: see text]) or sulfite ([Formula: see text]) before its assimilation and subsequent incorporation into sulfur-containing amino acids and their derivatives. Two key genes in the K. pastoris inorganic sulfur assimilation pathway were deleted separately and the ability of each deletion mutant to utilize sulfamate and other selected sulfur sources was studied. Deletion of the MET3 gene (which encodes the enzyme ATP sulfurylase) did not affect growth on L-methionine, sulfite, methanesulfonate, or taurine but completely abolished growth on sulfate, methyl sulfate and sulfamate. Deletion of the MET5 gene (which encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme sulfite reductase) abolished growth on all tested sulfur sources except L-methionine. These results suggest that the catabolism of sulfamate proceeds through a sulfate intermediate before its assimilation.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression of a laccase from Coriolopsis gallica in Pichia pastoris using a modified alpha-factor preproleader.</h4><p>M. Avelar et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602730>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work we communicate the heterologous expression of a laccase from Coriolopsis gallica in Pichia pastoris. This enzyme has been reported to efficiently degrade a variety of pollutants such as industrial dyes. The expression strategy included using a previously reported modified alpha-factor preproleader for enhanced secretion and pAOX1, a methanol-responsive promoter. Methanol concentration, copper salts concentration and temperature were varied in order to enhance laccase expression in this heterologous system. A volumetric activity of 250 U/L was achieved after 12-day culture in Fernbach flasks. The protein was recovered from the supernatant and purified, obtaining a preparation with 90% electrophoretic purity. The catalytic constants of the recombinant enzyme are almost identical to the fungal enzyme, thus rendering this system a useful tool for protein engineering of laccase from C. gallica.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of a novel GH11 xylanase from saline-alkali soil with excellent tolerance to high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol.</h4><p>H. Wang et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602686>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A GH11 xylanase gene (xyn11-1) cloned from saline-alkali soil was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The purified recombinant Xyn11-1 showed its maximal activity at pH 6.0, and retained more than 60.4% of activity at pH 10.0, with good pH stability. Its optimal temperature was 50 degrees C and it was stable after incubation for 1 h at 30 degrees C. Furthermore, Xyn11-1 was highly salt-tolerant, retaining more than 77.4% of activity in the presence of 0.25-4 M NaCl and displaying more than 47.2% relative activity after being incubated in the presence of 5 M NaCl at 37 degrees C for 10 min. In addition, 5 mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, Cu2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ increased the xylanase activity by 22.3%, 8.8%, 7.1%, and 4.4%, respectively. Significantly, 93.4% and 59.8% of the optimal activity was retained in the presence of 2% and 10% (v/v) ethanol, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the Km,Vmax, and Kcat value of Xyn11-1 for beechwood xylan were 3.7 mg ml-1, 101.0 mumol min-1 mg-1 and 42.1 s-1, respectively. Xyn11-1 is a strict endo-beta-1,4-xylanase, its main enzymatic products being xylotetraose and xylopentaose. Xyn11-1 is the first reported GH11 xylanase isolated from saline-alkali soil, and has excellent tolerance of high pH, high salt concentrations and ethanol, which indicates its great potential for basic research and industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Enzymatic Degradation of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters by P. pastoris Expressed Cutinase 1 from Thermobifida cellulosilytica.</h4><p>C. Gamerith et al., Front Microbiol 8 938 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596765>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To study hydrolysis of aromatic and aliphatic polyesters cutinase 1 from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Thc_Cut1) was expressed in P. pastoris. No significant differences between the expression of native Thc_Cut1 and of two glycosylation site knock out mutants (Thc_Cut1_koAsn and Thc_Cut1_koST) concerning the total extracellular protein concentration and volumetric activity were observed. Hydrolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was shown for all three enzymes based on quantification of released products by HPLC and similar concentrations of released terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) were detected for all enzymes. Both tested aliphatic polyesters poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) were hydrolyzed by Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut1_koST, although PBS was hydrolyzed to significantly higher extent than PHBV. These findings were also confirmed via quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis; for PHBV only a small mass change was observed while the mass of PBS thin films decreased by 93% upon enzymatic hydrolysis with Thc_Cut1. Although both enzymes led to similar concentrations of released products upon hydrolysis of PET and PHBV, Thc_Cut1_koST was found to be significantly more active on PBS than the native Thc_Cut1. Hydrolysis of PBS films by Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut1_koST was followed by weight loss and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Within 96 h of hydrolysis up to 92 and 41% of weight loss were detected with Thc_Cut1_koST and Thc_Cut1, respectively. Furthermore, SEM characterization of PBS films clearly showed that enzyme tretment resulted in morphological changes of the film surface.</p></details><hr><h4>Multicopy plasmid integration in Komagataella phaffii mediated by a defective auxotrophic marker.</h4><p>M. O. Betancur et al., Microb Cell Fact 16 99 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28595601>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> A commonly used approach to improve recombinant protein production is to increase the levels of expression by providing extra-copies of a heterologous gene. In Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) this is usually accomplished by transforming cells with an expression vector carrying a drug-resistance marker following a screening for multicopy clones on plates with increasingly higher concentrations of an antibiotic. Alternatively, defective auxotrophic markers can be used for the same purpose. These markers are generally transcriptionally impaired genes lacking most of the promoter region. Among the defective markers commonly used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is leu2-d, an allele of LEU2 which is involved in leucine metabolism. Cells transformed with this marker can recover prototrophy when they carry multiple copies of leu2-d in order to compensate the poor transcription from this defective allele.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> A K. phaffii strain auxotrophic for leucine (M12) was constructed by disrupting endogenous LEU2. The resulting strain was successfully transformed with a vector carrying leu2-d and an EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter gene. Vector copy numbers were determined from selected clones which grew to different colony sizes on transformation plates. A direct correlation was observed between colony size, number of integrated vectors and EGFP production. By using this approach we were able to isolate genetically stable clones bearing as many as 20 integrated copies of the vector and with no significant effects on cell growth.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> In this work we have successfully developed a genetic system based on a defective auxotrophic which can be applied to improve heterologous protein production in K. phaffii. The system comprises a K. phaffii leu2 strain and an expression vector carrying the defective leu2-d marker which allowed the isolation of multicopy clones after a single transformation step. Because a linear correlation was observed between copy number and heterologous protein production, this system may provide a simple approach to improve recombinant protein productivity in K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant thermo-alkali-stable endoglucanase of Myceliopthora thermophila BJA (rMt-egl): Biochemical characteristics and applicability in enzymatic saccharification of agro-residues.</h4><p>P. Phadtare, S. Joshi, T. Satyanarayana, Int J Biol Macromol 104 107 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28591592>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Codon adaptation index (CAI) of a 1263bp long endoglucanase encoding gene from the thermophilic mould Myceliopthora thermophile BJA has been improved from 0.44 to 0.76 by in vitro gene synthesis. The codon optimized endoglucanase gene (Mt-egl) has been constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris under the regulation of GAP promoter. Recombinant endoglucanase (rMt-egl), purified by size exclusion chromatography, has been confirmed to be a monomeric protein of approximately 47kDa. rMt-egl is optimally active at pH 10 and 50 degrees C, displaying stability in broad pH and temperature ranges, with a t1/2 of 60 and 15min at 90 and 100 degrees C, respectively. This retained approximately 70% of activity after 3h incubation at pH 5-12. The Km, Vmax, kcat and kcat/Km of rMt-egl were 5mgmL-1, 20mumolesmin-1mg-1, 1.02x103s-1 and 204s-1mg-1mL-1, respectively. Homology modeling and bioinformatics analysis confirmed catalytically important role of glutamate 234 and 344. rMt-egl released high amounts of reducing sugars from wheat bran and corn cobs (421 and 382mgg-1), thus making it a useful biocatalyst for producing bioethanol and fine chemicals from agro-residues.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant protein expression of Moringa oleifera lectin in methylotrophic yeast as active coagulant for sustainable high turbid water treatment.</h4><p>M. A. Abd Wahid et al., Biosci Biotechnol Biochem  1 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585494>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The natural coagulant Moringa oleifera lectin (MoL) as cationic protein is a promising candidate in coagulation process of water treatment plant. Introducing the gene encoding MoL into a host, Pichia pastoris, to secrete soluble recombinant protein is assessed in this study. Initial screening using PCR confirmed the insertion of MoL gene, and SDS-PAGE analysis detected the MoL protein at 8 kDa. Cultured optimization showed the highest MoL protein at 520 mg/L was observed at 28 degrees C for 144 h of culturing by induction in 1% methanol. Approximately, 0.40 mg/mL of recombinant MoL protein showed 95 +/- 2% turbidity removal of 1% kaolin suspension. In 0.1% kaolin suspension, the concentration of MoL at 10 mug/mL exhibits the highest turbidity reduction at 68 +/- 1%. Thus, recombinant MoL protein from P. pastoris is an effective coagulant for water treatment.</p></details><hr><h4>Enhanced expression of lipase I from Galactomyces geotrichum by codon optimisation in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>H. Qiao et al., Protein Expr Purif   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583876>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Relatively poor heterologous protein yields have limited the frequency of Galactomyces geotrichum lipase I (GGl I) efficacy trials. To address this, we have redesigned the GGl I gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) while retaining the same amino acid sequence. The wild type and codon optimised GGl I (GGl I-wt and GGl I-op) were synthesised and cloned into pPICZalphaA with an N-terminal 6 x His tag sequence and expressed in P. pastoris X 33. The hydrolytic activity of GGl I-op was 150 U/mL, whereas the activity of the GGl I-wt could not be detected. GGl I-op recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and then characterised. The identity and purity of GGl I were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. Enzymatic deglycosylation was used to show that the lipase is a glycosylated protein, containing approximately 10% sugar. The molecular weight (MW) of the GGl I secreted by recombinant P. pastoris was approximated at 63 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant lipase were 8.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was active over a broad pH range (7.0-9.0) and temperature range (20 degrees C-45 degrees C). The lipase showed high activity toward medium- and long-chain fatty acid methyl esters (C8-C16) and retained much of its activity in the present of Tween-80 and Trition X-100. Lipase activity was stimulated by Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+ and inhibited by Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+ and Co2+. This lipase may prove useful to the detergent industry and in organic synthesis reactions.</p></details><hr><h4>Anion-exchange chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry: a powerful tool for merging targeted and non-targeted metabolomics.</h4><p>M. Schwaiger et al., Anal Chem   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28581703>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>In this work, simultaneous targeted metabolic profiling by isotope dilution and non-targeted fingerprinting is proposed for cancer cell studies. The novel streamlined metabolomics workflow was established using anion-exchange chromatography (IC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (MS). The separation time of strong anion-exchange (2 mm column, flow rate 380 microL min-1, injection volume 5 microL) could be decreased to 25 min for a target list comprising organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates and nucleotides. Internal standardization by fully 13C labeled Pichia pastoris extracts enabled absolute quantification of the primary metabolites in adherent cancer cell models. Limits of detection (LODs) in the low nM range and excellent intermediate precisions of the isotopologue ratios (on average < 5% N=5 over 40 hours) were observed. As a result of internal standardization, linear dynamic ranges over 4 orders of magnitude (5 nM - 50 microM, R2 > 0.99) were obtained. Experiments on drug-sensitive versus resistant SW480 cancer cells showed the feasibility of merging analytical tasks into one analytical run. Comparing fingerprinting with and without internal standard proved that the presence of the 13C labeled yeast extract required for absolute quantification was not detrimental to non-targeted data evaluation. Several interesting metabolites were discovered by accurate mass and comparing MS2 spectra (acquired in ddMS2 mode) with spectral libraries. Significant differences revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes of drug-sensitive and resistant SW480 cells.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the Catalytic Performance of a Talaromyces leycettanus alpha-Amylase by Changing the Linker Length.</h4><p>D. Zhang et al., J Agric Food Chem   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28573852>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A novel alpha-amylase, Amy13A, that consists of these domains was identified in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802: catalytic TIM-barrel fold, domain B, domain C, Thr/Ser-rich linker region, and C-terminal CBM20 domain. The wild type and three mutant enzymes were then expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 to identify the roles of linker length (Amy13A21 and Amy13A33) and CBM20 (Amy13A-CBM) in catalysis. All enzymes had similar enzymatic properties, exhibiting optimal activities at pH 4.5-5.0 and 55-60 degrees C, but varied in catalytic performance. When using soluble starch as the substrate, Amy13A21 and Amy13A33 showed specific activities (926.3 and 537.8 units/mg, respectively, vs 252.1 units/mg) and catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km, 25.7 and 22.0 mL s-1 mg-1, respectively, vs 15.4 mL s-1 mg-1) higher than those of the wild type, while Amy13A-CBM performed worse during catalysis. This study reveals the key roles of the CBM and linker length in the catalysis of GH13 alpha-amylase.</p></details><hr><h4>Cloning, Production and Characterization of a Glycoside Hydrolase Family 7 Enzyme from the Gut Microbiota of the Termite Coptotermes curvignathus.</h4><p>J. S. Woon et al., Mol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28573450>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Coptotermes curvignathus is a termite that, owing to its ability to digest living trees, serves as a gold mine for robust industrial enzymes. This unique characteristic reflects the presence of very efficient hydrolytic enzyme systems including cellulases. Transcriptomic analyses of the gut of C. curvignathus revealed that carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) were encoded by 3254 transcripts and that included 69 transcripts encoding glycoside hydrolase family 7 (GHF7) enzymes. Since GHF7 enzymes are useful to the biomass conversion industry, a gene encoding for a GHF7 enzyme (Gh1254) was synthesized, sub-cloned and expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Expressed GH1254 had an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa, but purification was hampered by its low expression levels in shaken flasks. To obtain more of the enzyme, GH1254 was produced in a bioreactor that resulted in a fourfold increase in crude enzyme levels. The purified enzyme was active towards soluble synthetic substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside and 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-lactoside but was non-hydrolytic towards Avicel or carboxymethyl cellulose. GH1254 catalyzed optimally at 35 degrees C and maintained 70% of its activity at 25 degrees C. This enzyme is thus potentially useful in food industries employing low-temperature conditions.</p></details><hr><h4>Genome-wide characterization of cellulases from the hemi-biotrophic plant pathogen, Bipolaris sorokiniana, reveals the presence of a highly stable GH7 endoglucanase.</h4><p>S. Aich et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 135 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559926>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Bipolaris sorokiniana is a filamentous fungus that causes spot blotch disease in cereals like wheat and has severe economic consequences. However, information on the identities and role of the cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE) in B. sorokiniana is very limited. Several fungi produce CWDE like glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) that help in host cell invasion. To understand the role of these CWDE in B. sorokiniana, the first step is to identify and annotate all possible genes of the GH families like GH3, GH6, GH7, GH45 and AA9 and then characterize them biochemically.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> We confirmed and annotated the homologs of GH3, GH6, GH7, GH45 and AA9 enzymes in the B. sorokiniana genome using the sequence and domain features of these families. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of these homologs revealed that the transcripts of the BsGH7-3 (3rd homolog of the GH 7 family in B. sorokiniana) were most abundant. BsGH7-3, the gene of BsGH7-3, was thus cloned into pPICZalphaC Pichia pastoris vector and expressed in X33 P. pastoris host to be characterized. BsGH7-3 enzyme showed a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C and a pHopt of 8.1. BsGH7-3 was identified to be an endoglucanase based on its broad substrate specificity and structural comparisons with other such endoglucanases. BsGH7-3 has a very long half-life and retains 100% activity even in the presence of 4 M NaCl, 4 M KCl and 20% (v/v) ionic liquids. The enzyme activity is stimulated up to fivefold in the presence of Mn+2 and Fe+2 without any deleterious effects on enzyme thermostability.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Here we reanalysed the B. sorokiniana genome and selected one GH7 enzyme for further characterization. The present work demonstrates that BsGH7-3 is an endoglucanase with a long half-life and no loss in activity in the presence of denaturants like salt and ionic liquids, and lays the foundation towards exploring the Bipolaris genome for other cell wall-degrading enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolic construction strategies for direct methanol utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</h4><p>Z.

After successful integration of methanol oxidation pathway originated from Pichia pastoris into the chromosome of S. cerevisiae, the recombinant showed 1.04g/L consumption of methanol and 3.13% increase of cell growth (OD600) when using methanol as the sole carbon source. Moreover, 0.26g/L of pyruvate was detected in the fermentation broth. The supplementation of 1g/L yeast extract could further improve cell growth with increase of 11.70% and methanol consumption to 2.35g/L. This represents the first genetically modified non-methylotrophic eukaryotic microbe for direct methanol utilization and would be of great value concerning the development of biotechnological processes.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level expression of a bacterial laccase, CueO from Escherichia coli K12 in Pichia pastoris GS115 and its application on the decolorization of synthetic dyes.</h4><p>X.

The yacK gene coding CueO was cloned into an expression vector of Pichia pastoris, pHBM905BDM and expressed in a secretory form with Pichia pastoris GS115 as the host. The yield of the recombinant protein was 556mg/L with high-density fermentation and the enzyme activity was about 41,000U/L. The recombinant laccase was purified and characterized. Its optimum pH and temperature was 3.0 and 55 degrees C with 2, 2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the substrate, respectively. This recombinant protein was thermostable and its half life at 70 degrees C was about 60min. In the presence of natural redox mediator acetosyringone, the purified recombinant laccase decolorized 98.1% and 98.5% of Congo red, malachite green, respectively. It also decolorized 90.03% of Remazol brilliant blue R without this mediator.

However, it has been discontinued clinically due to the production issue related to the bacterial expression system with difficult purification. Recently we have developed monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins targeting human CD25+ cells using advanced unique diphtheria toxin resistant yeast Pichia Pastoris expression system. In vitro efficacy characterization using human CD25+ HUT102/6TG cells demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent isoforms are potent and the bivalent isoform is approximately two logs more potent than the monovalent isoform. In this study, we further assessed the in vivo efficacy of the human IL-2 fusion toxins using human CD25+ HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mouse model. The data demonstrated that both monovalent and bivalent human IL-2 fusion toxins significantly prolonged the survival of the human CD25+ tumor-bearing NSG mice in a dose-dependent manner. Then we further assessed the residual tumor cells from the HUT102/6TG tumor-bearing NSG mice using the residual tumor cell bearing NSG mouse model. The results demonstrated that the residual tumor cells were still sensitive to the continual treatment with the human IL-2 fusion toxin.

Accordingly, the unique ORF number was increased from 1026 to 1243. To improve the metabolic functions of P. pastoris genome-scale metabolic model, the biosynthesis pathways of vitamins and cofactors were carefully added. iRY1243 showed good performances when predicting the growth capability on most of the reported carbon and nitrogen sources, the metabolic flux distribution with glucose as a sole carbon source, the essential and partially essential genes, and the effects of gene deletion or overexpression on cell growth and S-adenosyl-l-methionine production.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> iRY1243 is an upgraded P. pastoris genome-scale metabolic model with significant improvements in the metabolic coverage and prediction ability, and thus it will be a potential platform for further systematic investigation of P. pastoris metabolism.</p></details><hr><h4>Insights into the prevalence and underlying causes of clonal variation through transcriptomic analysis in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R. Aw, G. R. Barton, D. J. Leak, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 101 5045 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534062>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Clonal variation, wherein a range of specific productivities of secreted proteins are observed from supposedly identical transformants, is an accepted aspect of working with Pichia pastoris. It means that a significant number of transformants need to be tested to obtain a representative sample, and in commercial protein production, companies regularly screen thousands of transformants to select for the highest secretor. Here, we have undertaken a detailed investigation of this phenomenon by characterising clones transformed with the human serum albumin gene. The titers of nine clones, each containing a single copy of the human serum albumin gene (identified by qPCR), were measured and the clones grouped into three categories, namely, high-, mid- and low-level secretors. Transcriptomic analysis, using microarrays, showed that no regulatory patterns consistently correlated with titer, suggesting that the causes of clonal variation are varied. However, a number of physiological changes appeared to underlie the differences in titer, suggesting there is more than one biochemical signature for a high-secreting strain. An anomalous low-secreting strain displaying high transcript levels that appeared to be nutritionally starved further emphasises the complicated nature of clonal variation.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a novel thermostable GH45 endoglucanase from Chaetomium thermophilum and its biodegradation of pectin.</h4><p>Q. Zhou et al., J Biosci Bioeng   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28528790>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A novel thermostable endoglucanase (CTendo45) encoding gene was cloned from Chaetomium thermophilum and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Sequence alignment indicated that the CTendo45 enzyme belonged to glycoside hydrolase family 45. The recombinant enzyme was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and its apparent molecular mass was estimated to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme displayed maximum activity at 70 degrees C and pH 4. CTendo45 was stable at 60 degrees C for 1 h, and residual activities of 78.9% and 65.6% were estimated after 1 h at 70 degrees C and 80 degrees C, respectively. Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+ were found to have beneficial effects on the enzyme activity to different degrees. The specific activity of purified CTendo45 was 1.52 IU mg-1 and the Km value was 59.6 mug ml-1 with a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose substrate. Moreover, CTendo45 exhibited high hydrolysis activity towards pectin, and the hydrolysis products were mainly galacturonic acid oligosaccharides. CTendo45 is the first reported bifunctional enzyme in glycoside hydrolase family 45 from C.thermophilum that is able to hydrolyze both cellulose and pectin. The biochemical properties of this recombinant CTendo45 make it a potentially effective glycoside hydrolase for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Functional regions of the peroxin Pex19 necessary for peroxisome biogenesis.</h4><p>G. Agrawal, H. H. Shang, Z. J. Xia, S. Subramani, J Biol Chem   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526747>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The peroxins Pex19 and Pex3 play an indispensable role in peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) biogenesis, peroxisome division and inheritance. Pex19 plays multiple roles in these processes, but how these functions relate to the structural organization of the Pex19 domains is unresolved. To this end, using deletion mutants, we mapped the Pex19 regions required for peroxisome biogenesis in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Surprisingly, import-competent peroxisomes still formed when Pex19 domains previously believed to be required for biogenesis were deleted, although the peroxisome size was larger than that in wild-type cells. Moreover, these mutants exhibited a delay of 14-24 h in peroxisome biogenesis. The shortest functional N-terminal (NTCs) and C-terminal constructs (CTCs) were Pex19 (aa 1-150) and Pex19 (aa 89-300), respectively. Deletions of the N-terminal Pex3-binding site disrupted direct interactions of Pex19 with Pex3, but preserved interactions with a membrane peroxisomal targeting signal (mPTS)-binding PMP, Pex10. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal mPTS-binding domain of Pex19 disrupted its interaction with Pex10, while leaving the Pex19-Pex3 interactions intact. However, Pex11 and Pex25 retained their interactions with both N- and C-terminal deletion mutants. NTC-CTC co-expression improved growth and reverted the larger-than-normal peroxisome size observed with the single deletions. Pex25 was critical for peroxisome formation with the CTC variants, and its overexpression enhanced their interactions with Pex3 and aided the growth of both NTC and CTC Pex19 variants. In conclusion, physical segregation of the Pex3 and PMP-binding domains of Pex19 has provided novel insights into the modular architecture of Pex19. We define the minimum region of Pex19 required for peroxisome biogenesis and a unique role for Pex25 in this process.</p></details><hr><h4>The effect of hypoxia on the lipidome of recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>N. Adelantado et al., Microb Cell Fact 16 86 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526017>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Cultivation of recombinant Pichia pastoris (Komagataella sp.) under hypoxic conditions has a strong positive effect on specific productivity when the glycolytic GAP promoter is used for recombinant protein expression, mainly due to upregulation of glycolytic conditions. In addition, transcriptomic analyses of hypoxic P. pastoris pointed out important regulation of lipid metabolism and unfolded protein response (UPR). Notably, UPR that plays a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and protein secretion, was found to be upregulated under hypoxia.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> To improve our understanding of the interplay between lipid metabolism, UPR and protein secretion, the lipidome of a P. pastoris strain producing an antibody fragment was studied under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, lipid composition analyses were combined with previously available transcriptomic datasets to further understand the impact of hypoxia on lipid metabolism. Chemostat cultures operated under glucose-limiting conditions under normoxic and hypoxic conditions were analyzed in terms of intra/extracellular product distribution and lipid composition. Integrated analysis of lipidome and transcriptome datasets allowed us to demonstrate an important remodeling of the lipid metabolism under limited oxygen availability. Additionally, cells with reduced amounts of ergosterol through fluconazole treatment were also included in the study to observe the impact on protein secretion and its lipid composition.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our results show that cells adjust their membrane composition in response to oxygen limitation mainly by changing their sterol and sphingolipid composition. Although fluconazole treatment results a different lipidome profile than hypoxia, both conditions result in higher recombinant protein secretion levels.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and Characterization of Windmill Palm Tree (Trachycarpus fortunei) Peroxidase by Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>B.

No recombinant plant peroxidase products have been available on the commercial market. The gene encoding peroxidase was cloned from windmill palm tree leaves. The codon-optimized gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris for expression. The recombinant windmill palm tree peroxidase (rWPTP) expressed by P. pastoris showed high stability under pH 2-10 and temperatures up to 70 degrees C to many metallic salts and organic solvents. The substrate specificity of WPTP was determined, and among the substrates tested, 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was most suitable for WPTP. The Michaelis constants with the substrates H2O2 and ABTS were 4.6 x 10-4 and 1.6 x 10-4 M, respectively. The rWPTP expressed in P. pastoris may be a suitable enzyme for the biosynthesis of polymers because of its high stability and activity under acidic conditions.</p></details><hr><h4>Investigating the effect of carbon source on rabies virus glycoprotein production in Pichia pastoris by a transcriptomic approach.</h4><p>S. Ben Azoun, H. Kallel, Microbiologyopen   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523730>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Several factors affect protein expression in Pichia pastoris, one among them is the carbon source. In this work, we studied the effect of this factor on the expression level of rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G) in two recombinant clones harboring seven copies of the gene of interest. The expression was driven either by the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter or the inducible alcohol oxidase1 (AOX1) promoter. Clones were compared in terms of cell physiology and carbon source metabolism. The transcription levels of 16 key genes involved in the central metabolic pathway, the methanol catabolism, and the oxidative stress were investigated in both clones. Cell size, as a parameter reflecting cell physiological changes, was also monitored. Our results showed that when glucose was used as the sole carbon source, large cells were obtained. Transcript levels of the genes of the central metabolic pathway were also upregulated, whereas antioxidative gene transcript levels were low. By contrast, the use of methanol as a carbon source generated small cells and a shift in carbon metabolism toward the dissimilatory pathway by the upregulation of formaldehyde dehydrogenase gene and the downregulation of those of the central metabolic. These observations are in favor of the use of glucose to enhance the expression of RABV-G in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Recombinant expression of thermostable processive MtEG5 endoglucanase and its synergism with MtLPMO from Myceliophthora thermophila during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates.</h4><p>A. Karnaouri et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 126 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515785>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Filamentous fungi are among the most powerful cellulolytic organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. To perform the degradation of lignocellulosic substrates, these microorganisms employ both hydrolytic and oxidative mechanisms that involve the secretion and synergism of a wide variety of enzymes. Interactions between these enzymes occur on the level of saccharification, i.e., the release of neutral and oxidized products, but sometimes also reflected in the substrate liquefaction. Although the synergism regarding the yield of neutral sugars has been extensively studied, further studies should focus on the oxidized sugars, as well as the effect of enzyme combinations on the viscosity properties of the substrates.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In the present study, the heterologous expression of an endoglucanase (EG) and its combined activity together with a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO), both from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila, are described. The EG gene, belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 5, was functionally expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The produced MtEG5A (75 kDa) featured remarkable thermal stability and showed high specific activity on microcrystalline cellulose compared to CMC, which is indicative of its processivity properties. The enzyme was capable of releasing high amounts of cellobiose from wheat straw, birch, and spruce biomass. Addition of MtLPMO9 together with MtEG5A showed enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis yields against regenerated amorphous cellulose (PASC) by improving the release not only of the neutral but also of the oxidized sugars. Assessment of activity of MtEG5A on the reduction of viscosity of PASC and pretreated wheat straw using dynamic viscosity measurements revealed that the enzyme is able to perform liquefaction of the model substrate and the natural lignocellulosic material, while when added together with MtLPMO9, no further synergistic effect was observed.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The endoglucanase MtEG5A from the thermophilic fungus M. thermophila exhibited excellent properties that render it a suitable candidate for use in biotechnological applications. Its strong synergism with LPMO was reflected in sugars release, but not in substrate viscosity reduction. Based on the level of oxidative sugar formation, this is the first indication of synergy between LPMO and EG reported.</p></details><hr><h4>Impact of "a" Determinant Mutations on Detection of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in HBV Strains from Chinese Patients with Occult Hepatitis B.</h4><p>X. Huang et al., J Med Virol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513915>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>This study was designed to detect mutations that occur within the "a" determinant in the S gene of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with occult hepatitis B (OHB), and to analyze the influence of these mutations on expression and reactivity of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Twenty-three certified OHB samples were compared to 32 HBsAg positive samples from patients with chronic hepatitis B. The median HBV DNA levels in the OHB group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.0001). Mutations within the "a" determinant were analyzed by gene amplification and sequencing. This revealed mixed infections in which clones within a sample displayed either different mutations or mutations in association with clones that exhibited wild type amino acid patterns. Sequencing analysis also showed a significant difference between the proportions of amino acid mutations observed in the OHB and control groups. Seven recombinant S (rS) proteins with corresponding OHB mutations and three wild type alleles were expressed and purified in the Pichia pastoris expression system to preserve conformational attributes, and their reactivity analyzed using six commercial HBsAg assays. The OHB sera were HBsAg nonreactive while the rS proteins with corresponding OHB mutations were universally reactive. Thus, we postulate that the reduced binding affinity between mutated HBsAg and its antibody may not be as important in defining OHB as is the effect of specific mutations in the preS/S region of the genome that affect the synthesis and secretion of the S protein and/or the virion.

Schwarzhans et al., Front Microbiol 8 780 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512458>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris is a non-conventional methylotrophic yeast that is widely used for recombinant protein production, typically by stably integrating the target gene into the genome as part of an expression cassette. However, the comparatively high clonal variability associated with this approach usually necessitates a time intense screening step in order to find strains with the desired productivity. Some of the factors causing this clonal variability can be overcome using episomal vectors containing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS). Here, we report on the discovery, characterization, and application of a fragment of mitochondrial DNA from P. pastoris for use as an ARS. First encountered as an off-target event in an experiment aiming for genomic integration, the newly created circular plasmid named "pMito" consists of the expression cassette and a fragment of mitochondrial DNA. Multiple matches to known ARS consensus sequence motifs, but no exact match to known chromosomal ARS from P. pastoris were detected on the fragment, indicating the presence of a novel ARS element. Different variants of pMito were successfully used for transformation and their productivity characteristics were assayed. All analyzed clones displayed a highly uniform expression level, exceeding by up to fourfold that of a reference with a single copy integrated in its genome. Expressed GFP could be localized exclusively to the cytoplasm via super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, indicating that pMito is present in the nucleus. While expression levels were homogenous among pMito clones, an apparent upper limit of expression was visible that could not be explained based on the gene dosage. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the bottle-neck hindering this and other ARS vectors in P. pastoris from reaching their full capability. Lastly, we could demonstrate that the mitochondrial ARS from P. pastoris is also suitable for episomal vector transformation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, widening the potential for biotechnological application. pMito displayed strong potential to reduce clonal variability in experiments targeting recombinant protein production. These findings also showcase the as of yet largely untapped potential of mitochondrial ARS from different yeasts for biotechnological applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Structural determinants of Neosartorya fischeri antifungal protein (NFAP) for folding, stability and antifungal activity.</h4><p>L. Galgoczy et al., Sci Rep 7 1963 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512317>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The recent global challenges to prevent and treat fungal infections strongly demand for the development of new antifungal strategies. The structurally very similar cysteine-rich antifungal proteins from ascomycetes provide a feasible basis for designing new antifungal molecules. The main structural elements responsible for folding, stability and antifungal activity are not fully understood, although this is an essential prerequisite for rational protein design. In this study, we used the Neosartorya fischeri antifungal protein (NFAP) to investigate the role of the disulphide bridges, the hydrophobic core, and the N-terminal amino acids in the formation of a highly stable, folded, and antifungal active protein. NFAP and its mutants carrying cysteine deletion (NFAPDeltaC), hydrophobic core deletion (NFAPDeltah), and N-terminal amino acids exchanges (NFAPDeltaN) were produced in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant NFAP showed the same features in structure, folding, stability and activity as the native protein. The data acquired with mass spectrometry, structural analyses and antifungal activity assays of NFAP and its mutants proved the importance of the disulphide bonding, the hydrophobic core and the correct N-terminus for folding, stability and full antifungal function. Our findings provide further support to the comprehensive understanding of the structure-function relationship in members of this protein group.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the temperature characteristics and catalytic efficiency of a mesophilic xylanase from Aspergillus oryzae, AoXyn11A, by iterative mutagenesis based on in silico design.</h4><p>X.

Firstly, Gly21 with the maximum B-factor value, which was confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on the three-dimensional structure of AoXyn11A, was subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis. Thus, one variant with the highest thermostability, AoXyn11AG21I, was selected from the mutagenesis library, E. coli/Aoxyn11A G21X (</p><p><strong>X:</strong> any one of 20 amino acids). Secondly, based on the primary structure multiple alignment of AoXyn11A with seven thermophilic GHF11 xylanases, AoXyn11AY13F or AoXyn11AG21I-Y13F, was designed by replacing Tyr13 in AoXyn11A or AoXyn11AG21I with Phe. Finally, three variant-encoding genes, Aoxyn11A G21I, Aoxyn11A Y13F and Aoxyn11A G21I-Y13F, were constructed by two-stage whole-plasmid PCR method, and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, respectively. The temperature optimum (T opt) of recombinant (re) AoXyn11AG21I-Y13F was 60 degrees C, being 5 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11AG21I or reAoXyn11AY13F, and 10 degrees C higher than that of reAoXyn11A. The thermal inactivation half-life (t 1/2) of reAoXyn11AG21I-Y13F at 50 degrees C was 240 min, being 40-, 3.4- and 2.5-fold longer than those of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11AG21I and reAoXyn11AY13F. The melting temperature (T m) values of reAoXyn11A, reAoXyn11AG21I, reAoXyn11AY13F and reAoXyn11AG21I-Y13F were 52.3, 56.5, 58.6 and 61.3 degrees C, respectively. These findings indicated that the iterative mutagenesis of both Gly21Ile and Tyr13Phe improved the temperature characteristics of AoXyn11A in a synergistic mode. Besides those, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of reAoXyn11AG21I-Y13F was 473.1 mL mg-1 s-1, which was 1.65-fold higher than that of reAoXyn11A.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of a new multifunctional beta-glucosidase from Musca domestica.</h4><p>S.

The gene bg was linked to pPICZalphaA and expressed in P. pastoris with a yield of 500 mg l-1. The enzyme has the maximum activity with 27.6 U mg-1 towards cellulose. The beta-glucosidase has stable activity from 20 to 70 degrees C and can tolerate one-mole glucose. It has the maximum activities for salicin (25.9 +/- 1.8 U mg-1), cellobiose (40.1 +/- 2.3 U mg-1) and cellulose (27.6 +/- 3.5 U mg-1). The wide-range substrate activities of the beta-glucosidase were further verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectra. Structural analysis shows that the beta-glucosidase belongs to glycoside hydrolase family Iota and possesses O-glycosylation sites.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Thus, a multifunctional beta-glucosidase was expressed from M. domestica and provides a potential tool for industrial application of cellulose.</p></details><hr><h4>Autolysis of Pichia pastoris induced by cold.</h4><p>Y.

Protein recovery represents a major part of the production costs. Pichia pastoris is one of the microbial systems most used for the production of heterologous proteins. The use of a cold-induced promoter to express lytic enzymes in the yeast after the growth stage could reduce protein recovery costs. This study shows that a cold-shock can be applied to induce lysis of the yeast cells. A strain of P. pastoris was constructed in which the endogenous eng gene encoding a putative endo-beta-1,3-glucanase was overexpressed using the cold-shock induced promoter of the cctalpha gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the transgenic P. pastoris, the expression of eng increased 3.6-fold after chilling the cells from 30 to 4 degrees C (cold-shock stage) followed by incubation for 6 h (eng expression stage). The culture was heated to 30 degrees C for 6 h (ENG synthesis stage) and kept at 37 degrees C for 24 h (lysis stage). After this procedure the cell morphology changed, spheroplasts were obtained and cellular lysis was observed. Thus, a clone of P. pastoris was obtained, which undergoes autolysis after a cold-shock.</p></details><hr><h4>In vitro characterization of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) IL-26 in regulating inflammatory factors.</h4><p>X. Qiu et al., Fish Shellfish Immunol 66 148 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28495510>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Interleukin 26 (IL-26) gene has been identified in human, amphibian and teleost but not in rodents. It is well accepted that IL-26 was a crucial member of IL-10 family which acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in human. However, the role of IL-26 in regulating inflammation in lower vertebrates including teleost has not been defined yet. In the present study, grass carp IL-26 (gcIL-26) coding sequence was isolated and identified. Its chromosomal synteny was also analyzed, showing that gcIL-26 gene is flanked by IL-22 and IFN-gamma genes with the same transcriptional orientation as seen in human, amphibian and zebrafish. Given that zebrafish and grass carp IL-26 shared relatively low amino acid identities with human IL-26, the functional roles of fish IL-26 are indispensable to be elucidated. Accordingly, recombinant gcIL-26 (rgcIL-26) was prepared by using Pichia pastoris expression system, and it was found to be partially glycosylated. Using grass carp head kidney leucocytes as cell model, rgcIL-26 displayed the bioactivity to stimulate the mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-1beta and IL-6, while inhibit mRNA expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Moreover, rgcIL-26 also up-regulated inos expression and NO production in grass carp monocytes/macrophages, strengthening its pro-inflammatory properties in fish. Those results collectively demonstrated the functional role of IL-26 in regulating inflammatory response in fish.</p></details><hr><h4>Directed evolution and secretory expression of a pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase with enhanced catalytic activity and thermostability.</h4><p>X. Liu, M. Liang, Y. Liu, X.

It is necessary to develop some efficient strategies to degrade pyrethroid residues. Biodegradation is generally considered as a safe, efficient, and inexpensive way to eliminate environmental contaminants. To date, although several pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterases have been cloned, there has been no report about a pyrethroid hydrolase with high hydrolytic activity, good stability, and high productivity, indispensable enzymatic properties in practical biodegradation. Almost all pyrethroid hydrolases are intracellular enzymes, which require complex extraction protocols and present issues in terms of easy inactivation and low production.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, random mutagenesis was performed on one pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase, Sys410, to enhance its activity and thermostability. Two beneficial mutations, A171V and D256N, were obtained by random mutagenesis and gave rise to the mutant M2. The mutant displayed ~1.5-fold improvement in the kcat/Km value and 2.46-fold higher catalytic activity. The optimal temperature was 10 degrees C higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (55 degrees C). The half-life at 40-65 degrees C was 3.3-310 times longer. It was surprising that M2 has a half-life of 12 h at 70 degrees C while Sys410 was completely inactivated at 70 degrees C. In addition, the desired gene was extracellularly expressed in a Pichia pastoris host system. The soluble expression level reached up to 689.7 mg/L. Remarkably, the enzyme could efficiently degrade various pyrethroids at moderate temperature for 15 min, exceeding a hydrolysis rate of 98%, which is the highest value ever reported.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This is the first report about random mutagenesis and secretory expression of pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase with high-level productivity and purity in P. pastoris. Broad substrate specificity, enhanced activity and thermostability make M2 an ideal candidate for the biodegradation of pyrethroid residues.</p></details><hr><h4>Improved thermostability of an acidic xylanase from Aspergillus sulphureus by combined disulphide bridge introduction and proline residue substitution.</h4><p>W. Yang et al., Sci Rep 7 1587 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484256>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As a feed additive, xylanase has been widely applied in the feed of monogastric animals, which contains multiple plant polysaccharides. However, during feed manufacture, the high pelleting temperatures challenge wild-type xylanases. The aim of this study was to improve the thermostability of Aspergillus sulphureus acidic xylanase. According to the predicted protein structure, a series of disulphide bridges and proline substitutions were created in the xylanase by PCR, and the mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Enzyme properties were evaluated following chromatographic purification. All the recombinant enzymes showed optima at pH 3.0 and 50 degrees C or 55 degrees C and better resistance to some chemicals except for CuSO4. The specific activity of the xylanase was decreased by introduction of the mutations. Compared to the wild-type enzyme, a combined mutant, T53C-T142C/T46P, with a disulphide bond at 53-142 and a proline substitution at 46, showed a 22-fold increase of half-life at 60 degrees C. In a 10-L fermentor, the maximal xylanase activity of T53C-T142C/T46P reached 1,684 U/mL. It was suggested that the T53C-T142C/T46P mutant xylanase had excellent thermostability characteristics and could be a prospective additive in feed manufacture.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of a novel recombinant cyanate hydratase (rTl-Cyn) in Pichia pastoris, characteristics and applicability in the detoxification of cyanate.</h4><p>B. Ranjan, S. Pillai, K. Permaul, S. Singh, Bioresour Technol 238 582 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28482284>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recombinant Pichia pastoris harbouring the cyanate hydratase gene (rTl-Cyn) from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus SSBP yielded a high titre of extracellular cyanate hydratase (100+/-13UmL-1) which was approximately 10-fold higher than the native fungal strain. The purified rTl-Cyn had a molecular mass of approximately 20kDa on SDS-PAGE, with Km, Vmax, kcat and kcat/Km values of 0.34mM, 2857.14micromolesmg-1min-1, 2.14x104s-1 and 6.3 x107M-1s-1, respectively. Its properties of thermostability, pH stability, and heavy metals insensitivity, make it a suitable candidate for bioremediation in extreme environments. The rTl-Cyn was able to degrade toxic cyanate completely with the liberation of ammonia, which was confirmed by FTIR analysis. This is the first report of any known cyanate hydratase that has been expressed in P. pastoris, characterized and effectively evaluated for cyanate detoxification.</p></details><hr><h4>Thermostable multifunctional GH74 xyloglucanase from Myceliophthora thermophila: high-level expression in Pichia pastoris and characterization of the recombinant protein.</h4><p>O. V. Berezina et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477154>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A xyloglucanase of the GH74 family was identified in the thermophilic fungus strain Myceliophthora thermophila VKPM F-244, and its gene sequence was optimized for cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant xyloglucanase MtXgh74 exhibited the highest activity toward tamarind seed xyloglucan with a K M value of 0.51 +/- 0.06 mg/mL. The activities on barley beta-glucan and carboxymethylcellulose were about 4 and 2%, respectively, compared to xyloglucan. Maximum xyloglucanase activity was observed at 70-75 degrees C and pH 6.5. After pre-incubation at 50 degrees C, pH 6.0 for 3 h, the enzyme retained 100% of its activity. The half-life of MtXgh74 at 60 degrees C, pH 6.0 was 40 min. In P. pastoris, MtXgh74 was produced in glycosylated form. The enzyme production in a 1 L bioreactor resulted in a yield of 118 U/mL or 5.3 g/L after 51 h fermentation. Kinetic studies of the hydrolysis product formation suggest that MtXgh74 has an endo-processive mode of action. The final products were the standard xyloglucan building blocks XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, and XLLG. Additionally, MtXgh74 hydrolyzed various linkages within the xyloglucan building blocks XXXG, XXLG, and XLXG (except XLLG) producing diverse low molecular weight oligosaccharides which may be identified by MALDI-TOF as XG, XX, XXG/GXX/XGX, XXX, LG, LX/XL, XLX/XXL, LLG, GXXXG, GXLLG, XLLGX. The unique combination of different activities within one enzyme along with its high thermostability and specificity toward xyloglucan makes MtXgh74 a promising candidate enzyme for industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>LILY-lipidome isotope labeling of yeast: in vivo synthesis of 13C labeled reference lipids for quantification by mass spectrometry.</h4><p>E. Rampler et al., Analyst 142 1891 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475182>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Quantification is an essential task in comprehensive lipidomics studies challenged by the high number of lipids, their chemical diversity and their dynamic range of the lipidome. In this work, we introduce lipidome isotope labeling of yeast (LILY) in order to produce (non-radioactive) isotopically labeled eukaryotic lipid standards in yeast for normalization and quantification in mass spectrometric assays. More specifically, LILY is a fast and efficient in vivo labeling strategy in Pichia pastoris for the production of 13C labeled lipid library further paving the way to comprehensive compound-specific internal standardization in quantitative mass spectrometry based assays. More than 200 lipid species (from PA, PC, PE, PG, PI, PS, LysoGP, CL, DAG, TAG, DMPE, Cer, HexCer, IPC, MIPC) were obtained from yeast extracts with an excellent 13C enrichment >99.5%, as determined by complementary high resolution mass spectrometry based shotgun and high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. In a first proof of principle study we tested the relative and absolute quantification capabilities of the 13C enriched lipids obtained by LILY using a parallel reaction monitoring based LC-MS approach. In relative quantification it could be shown that compound specific internal standardization was essential for the accuracy extending the linear dynamic range to four orders of magnitude. Excellent analytical figures of merit were observed for absolute quantification for a selected panel of 5 investigated glycerophospholipids (e.g. LOQs around 5 fmol absolute; typical concentrations ranging between 1 to 10 nmol per 108 yeast cell starting material; RSDs <10% (N = 4)).</p></details><hr><h4>The Length of N-Glycans of Recombinant H5N1 Hemagglutinin Influences the Oligomerization and Immunogenicity of Vaccine Antigen.</h4><p>A. K. Maciola et al., Front Immunol 8 444 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28473830>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is a principle influenza vaccine antigen. Recombinant HA-based vaccines become a potential alternative for traditional approach. Complexity and variation of HA N-glycosylation are considered as the important factors for the vaccine design. The number and location of glycan moieties in the HA molecule are also crucial. Therefore, we decided to study the effect of N-glycosylation pattern on the H5 antigen structure and its ability to induce immunological response. We also decided to change neither the number nor the position of the HA glycosylation sites but only the glycan length. Two variants of the H5 antigen with high mannose glycosylation (H5hm) and with low-mannose glycosylation (H5Man5) were prepared utilizing different Pichia strains. Our structural studies demonstrated that only the highly glycosylated H5 antigen formed high molecular weight oligomers similar to viral particles. Further, the H5hm was much more immunogenic for mice than H5Man5. In summary, our results suggest that high mannose glycosylation of vaccine antigen is superior to the low glycosylation pattern. Our findings have strong implications for the recombinant HA-based influenza vaccine design.</p></details><hr><h4>An anti-amoebic vaccine: generation of the recombinant antigen LC3 from Entamoeba histolytica linked to mutated exotoxin A (PEDeltaIII) via the Pichia pastoris system.</h4><p>S.

H. Liang, S. S. Zhou, J. G. Jiang, Enzyme Microb Technol 102 74 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28465064>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>HBscFv-IFNgamma, a fusion protein constructed by fusing gamma-interferon (IFNgamma) with an antibody fragment HBscFv for the purpose of targeted delivery of the cytokine IFNgamma, was designed in order to enhance its therapeutic efficacy through increasing its hepatoma localization. HBscFv and IFNgamma were connected into HBscFv-IFNgamma by the linker (Gly4Ser)3, and then the multicopy recombinant plasmids pPICZalphaA/(HBscFv-IFNgamma)1,2,4 were constructed and transformed into Komagatella (Pichia) pastoris X33. The engineering strain X4, which had much higher copy number and could secretively express HBscFv-IFNgamma, was screened from transformed X33 by qPCR. Results from SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and ELISA indicated that HBscFv-IFNgamma displayed an excellent immunoreaction against HBsAg. The culture supernatant of X4 was purified by 14F7 affinity chromatography to obtain the fusion protein HBscFv-IFNgamma in a purity of 95-98%. The HBscFv-IFNgamma was able to bind 27.9% HBsAg in the serum of HBV transgenic mice, showing that the antibody of HBscFv-IFNgamma has high binding affinity against HBsAg. The expressing of the recombinant HBscFv-IFNgamma in P. pastoris provides a promising and inexpensive diagnostic reagent for preventing HBV infection.</p></details>
