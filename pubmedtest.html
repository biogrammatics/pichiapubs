To produce significant amounts of Hispidalin, a recombinant Hispidalin with an N-terminal 6xHis tag and an enterokinase sequence, for the first time, was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris cell factory. Results showed that the E. coli-derived recombinant Hispidalin did not show any antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains, whereas the P. pastoris-derived recombinant Hispidalin (rHispidalin) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against five pathogenic bacteria of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. rHispidalin also has bactericidal activity and completely killed all of the Staphylococcus aureus within 40min. Additionally, rHispidalin showed a broad range of thermostability and pH stability, and a hemolytic activity of less than 2% even at a concentration of 300mug/ml; it was resistant to trypsin and proteinase K, but was moderately sensitive to pepsin and papain. Moreover, rHispidalin effectively permeabilized the cytoplasmic membrane and disrupted the morphology of targeted bacterial cells. After an initial optimization was performed, the amount of rHispidalin accumulation could reach as high as 98.6mug/ml. These results indicate that Hispidalin could be produced on a large scale by P. pastoris and has a great potential to be utilized as a new antibacterial agent for further development.</p></details></div>

Earlier we have described construction of the recombinant strains of methylotrophic thermotolerant yeast Ogataea polymorpha with simultaneous overexpression of the genes PDC1 and ADH1, which produced increased amounts of ethanol from glycerol. In this work, we have further improved these strains by overexpression of genes involved either in oxidative (through dihydroxyacetone) or phosphorylative (through glycerol-3-phosphate) pathway of glycerol catabolism, as well as heterologous gene coding for glycerol transporter FPS1 from Komagataella phaffii (formerly, Pichia pastoris). Obtained recombinant strains produced up to 10.7 g/l of ethanol (with ethanol productivity 30 mg/g of biomass/h and yield 132 mg/g of consumed glycerol) from pure glycerol and up to 3.55 g/l of ethanol (with ethanol productivity 11.6 mg/g of biomass/h and yield 72.3 mg/g of consumed glycerol) from crude glycerol as a carbon source, which is approximately 15 times more relative to that of the O. polymorpha wild-type strain and 2.2 more relative to the earlier constructed strain.</p></details></div>

These are proteins, typically with repetitive amino acid sequences, that have such physical properties that they can be used as functional materials. Well-known natural examples are collagen, silk, and elastin, but also artificial sequences have been devised. These proteins can be produced in a suitable host via recombinant DNA technology, and it is this inherent control over monomer sequence and molecular size that renders this class of polymers of particular interest to the fields of nanomaterials and biomedical research. Traditionally, Escherichia coli has been the main workhorse for the production of these polymers, but the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is finding increased use in view of the often high yields and potential bioprocessing benefits. We here provide an overview of protein-based polymers produced in P. pastoris. We summarize their physicochemical properties, briefly note possible applications, and detail their biosynthesis. Some challenges that may be faced when using P. pastoris for polymer production are identified: (i) low yields and poor process control in shake flask cultures; i.e., the need for bioreactors, (ii) proteolytic degradation, and (iii) self-assembly in vivo. Strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed, which we anticipate will be of interest also to readers involved in protein expression in P. pastoris in general.</p></details></div>

In this study, ChSase AC II from a newly isolated marine bacterium Arthrobacter sp. CS01 was cloned, expressed in Pichia pastoris X33, purified, and characterized. ChSase AC II, with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa and a specific activity of 18.7 U/mg, showed the highest activity at 37 degrees C and pH 6.5 and maintained stability at a broad range of pH (5(-)7.5) and temperature (below 35 degrees C). The enzyme activity was increased in the presence of Mn(2+) and was strongly inhibited by Hg(2+). Moreover, the kinetic parameters of ChSase AC II against CS-A, CS-C, and HA were determined. TLC and ESI-MS analysis of the degradation products indicated that ChSase AC II displayed an exolytic action mode and completely hydrolyzed three substrates into oligosaccharides with low degrees of polymerization (DPs). All these features make ChSase AC II a promising candidate for the full use of GAG to produce oligosaccharides.</p></details></div>

In this research, FOS produced by BfrA were characterized by HPAE-PAD analysis as a mixture of 1-kestotriose, 6(G)-kestotriose (neokestose), and to a major extent 6-kestotriose. In order to increase the FOS yield, three BfrA mutants (W14Y, W14Y-N16S and W14Y-W256Y), designed from sequence divergence between hydrolases and transferases, were constructed and constitutively expressed in the non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris. The secreted recombinant glycoproteins were purified and characterized. The three mutants synthesized 6-kestotriose as the major component of a FOS mixture that includes minor amounts of tetra- and pentasaccharides. In all cases, sucrose hydrolysis was the predominant reaction. All mutants reached a similar overall FOS yield, with the average value 37.6% (w/w) being 3-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (12.6%, w/w). None of the mutations altered the enzyme thermophilicity and thermostability. The single mutant W14Y, with specific activity of 841 U mg(-1), represents an attractive candidate for the continuous production of FOS-containing invert syrup at pasteurization temperatures.</p></details></div>

Due solely to their presence in the Wsc-family proteins working as a plasma membrane sensor for surface stress and in a fungal beta-1,3-exoglucanse, WSC domains have been presumed to possess carbohydrate-binding property without any experimental evidence. Aiming at elucidation of function(s) of WSC domains, we characterized a WSC domain-containing alcohol oxidase from the rice blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae (PoAlcOX). Recombinant PoAlcOX produced with Pichia pastoris showed alcohol oxidase activity toward a wide range of substrates including two aliphatic alcohols, a branched-chain alcohol, a diol, and a polyol. Deletion of the WSC domain virtually unaffected oxidation of these substrates by PoAlcOX, indicating that the domain makes no contribution to the catalytic activity. In analogy to some carbohydrate-binding modules, we inferred that the WSC domain plays a role in protein anchoring, and evaluated binding capability of PoAlcOX to a set of polysaccharide components of fungal and plant cell walls. This revealed that PoAlcOX binds to xylans and fungal chitin/beta-1,3-glucan in the WSC domain-dependent manner, demonstrating for the first time the carbohydrate-binding property of the domain. Additionally, we provide evidence that PoAlcOX immobilized on birch wood xylan retains the catalytic activity. Overall, the data we collected suggest that the role of the WSC domain of PoAlcOX is not recognition of substrates but attaching the enzyme to plant and/or fungal cell wall.</p></details></div>

In this sense, non-pungent capsaicin analogues as olvanil are a feasible alternative to the unpleasant sensations produced by capsaicin while maintaining a similar pharmacological profile. Olvanil can be obtained by a lipase-catalyzed chemoenzymatic process. In the present work, recombinant Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and subsequently immobilized by CLEA methodology for the synthesis of olvanil. The CALB-CLEAs were obtained directly from the fermentation broth of P. pastoris without any purification step in order to assess the role of the contaminant proteins of the crude extract as co-feeders. The CALB-CLEAs were also bioimprinted to enhance the catalytic performance in olvanil synthesis. When CALB was precipitated with isopropanol, the obtained CALB-CLEAs exhibited the highest activity in the synthesis of olvanil, regardless of the glutaraldehyde concentration. The maximum product synthesis was found at 72 h obtaining 6.8 g L(-1) of olvanil with a reaction yield of 16%. When CALB was bioimprinted with olvanil, the synthesis was enhanced 1.3 times, reaching 10.7 g L(-1) of olvanil at 72 h of reaction with a reaction yield of 25%. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated different morphologies of the CLEAs depending on the precipitating agent and the template used for bioimprinting. Recombinant CALB-CLEAs obtained directly from the fermentation broth are a suitable alternative to commercial enzymatic preparations for the synthesis of olvanil in organic medium.

However, obtaining sufficient amounts of millipedes is difficult, and the production of the Chamberlinius hualienensis HNL (ChuaHNL) in E. coli has not been very successful. Therefore, we investigated the conditions required for high-yield heterologous production of this enzyme using Pichia pastoris. When we employed P. pastoris to express His-ChuaHNL, the yield was very low (22.6 +/- 3.8 U/L culture). Hence, we investigated the effects of ChuaHNL codon optimization and the co-production of two protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) [from P. pastoris (PpPDI) and C. hualienensis (ChuaPDI1, ChuaPDI2)] on His-ChuaHNL production. The productivity of His-ChuaHNL was increased approximately 140 times per unit culture to 3170 +/- 144.7 U/L by the co-expression of codon-optimized ChuaHNL and PpPDI. Moreover, we revealed that the N-glycosylation on ChuaHNL had a large effect on the stability, enzyme secretion, and catalytic properties of ChuaHNL in P. pastoris. This study demonstrates an economical and efficient approach for the production of HNL, and the data show that glycosylation has a large effect on the enzyme properties and the P. pastoris expression system.</p></details></div>

Due to the high rate of protein production, incorrectly folded proteins may accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To restore their proper folding, the cell triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR); however, if the proteins cannot be repaired, they are degraded, which impairs process productivity. Moreover, a non-producing/non-secreting subpopulation of cells might occur, which also decreases overall productivity. Therefore, an in depth understanding of intracellular protein fluxes and population heterogeneity is needed to improve productivity. Under industrially relevant cultivation conditions in bioreactors, we cultured P. pastoris strains producing three different recombinant proteins: penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli (EcPGA), lipase B from Candida antarctica (CaLB) and xylanase A from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TlXynA). Extracellular and intracellular product concentrations were determined, along with flow cytometry-based single-cell measurements of cell viability and the up-regulation of UPR. The cell population was distributed into four clusters, two of which were viable cells with no UPR up-regulation, differing in cell size and complexity. The other two clusters were cells with impaired viability, and cells with up-regulated UPR. Over the time course of cultivation, the distribution of the population into these four clusters changed. After 30 h of production, 60% of the cells producing EcPGA, which accumulated in the cells (50-70% of the product), had up-regulated UPR, but only 13% of the cells had impaired viability. A higher proportion of cells with decreased viability was observed in strains producing CaLB (20%) and TlXynA (27%). The proportion of cells with up-regulated UPR in CaLB-producing (35%) and TlXynA-producing (30%) strains was lower in comparison to the EcPGA-producing strain, and a smaller proportion of CaLB and TlXynA (<10%) accumulated in the cells. These data provide an insight into the development of heterogeneity in a recombinant P. pastoris population during a biotechnological process. A deeper understanding of the relationship between protein production/secretion and the regulation of the UPR might be utilized in bioprocess control and optimization with respect to secretion and population heterogeneity.</p></details></div>

The overexpression of PLD in a recombinant strain is necessary to achieve large-scale PLD production. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of expressing PLD from Streptomyces halstedii in different hosts. The enzymatic activity of PLD reached 69.12 U/mL in the homologous Streptomyces lividans host, which was around 50-fold higher than that in the original host. Meanwhile, in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, PLD expression was poor and showed obvious toxicity to cells, which may have been one of the reasons for low levels of PLD observed in heterologous hosts. An induced (Ptip)/constitutive (PermE*) dual-promoter expression system in S. lividans was constructed, which could achieve constitutive expression with PLD enzymatic activity of 13.41 U/mL under non-induced conditions and yield the highest PLD enzymatic activity of 68.33 U/mL with 2 mug/mL thiostreptone. The concentration of the expensive inducer was significantly reduced to only 10% of that used in the original expression system without affecting the protein expression level, which provided a good foundation for subsequent industrial applications to reduce production costs.</p></details></div>

They have been demonstrated to able to C6-oxidize cellulose to produce C6-hexodialdoses. However, the biological function of C6 oxidation of PMOs remains unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether C6-hexodialdoses can be further oxidized to uronic acid (glucuronic acid-containing oligosaccharides). Results: A PMO gene, Hipmo1, was isolated from Humicola insolens and expressed in Pichia pastoris. This PMO (HiPMO1), belonging to the auxiliary activity 9 (AA9) family, was shown to able to cleave cellulose to yield non-oxidized and oxidized cello-oligosaccharides. The enzyme oxidizes C6 positions in cellulose to form glucuronic acid-containing cello-oligosaccharides, followed by hydrolysis with beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase to yield glucose, glucuronic acid, and saccharic acid. This indicates that HiPMO1 can catalyze C6 oxidation of hydroxyl groups of cellulose to carboxylic groups. Conclusions: HiPMO1 oxidizes C6 of cellulose to form glucuronic acid-containing cello-oligosaccharides followed by hydrolysis with beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase to yield glucose, glucuronic acid, and saccharic acid, and even possibly by beta-eliminative cleavage to produce unsaturated cello-oligosaccharides.

To lower the oxidation towards BD in A. simplex, the transformation was conducted sequentially by C1,2 dehydrogenation in A. simplex and 17beta-carbonyl reduction in recombinant P. pastoris GS115. Moreover, the reaction system was inactivated before recombinant P. pastoris GS115 was added to further inhibit the oxidation of BD by A. simplex, and the productivity of BD was improved 10.6% compared with the control. Furthermore, by optimizing the conditions of transformation from AD to BD, 4.2 g/L BD was generated with 83% productivity from 5.0 g/L AD, which was the highest productivity reported by biological method.

However, the high cost and low efficiency of phospholipase limit the application of enzymatic degumming. In this study, an 879 bp outer membrane phospholipase A (A1) (OM-PLA1) gene encoding 292 amino acid residues was isolated from the genome of Serratia marcescens. The recombinant OM-PLA1 profile of appropriately 33 KDa was expressed by the engineered Pichia pastoris GS115. The OM-PLA1 activity was 21.2 U/mL with the induction of 1 mM methanol for 72 h. The expression efficiencies of OM-PLA1 were 0.29 U/mL/h and 1.06 U/mL/OD600. A complex of magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) and OM-PLA1 (MGO-OM-PLA1) was prepared by immobilizing OM-PLA1 with graphene oxide-based Fe3O4 nanoparticles by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The content of phosphorus decreased to 5.1 mg/kg rapeseed oil from 55.6 mg/kg rapeseed oil with 0.02% MGO-OM-PLA1 (w/w) at 50 degrees C for 4 h. MGO-OM-PLA1 retained 51.7% of the initial activity after 13 times of continuous recycling for the enzymatic degumming of rapeseed oil. This study provided an effective approach for the enzymatic degumming of crude vegetable oil by developing a novel phospholipase and improving the degumming technology.</p></details></div>

To prevent the proliferation of undesired microorganisms, to retain labile and volatile flavor compounds, and to save energy, the current trend is to perform this process at low temperatures. However, the commercially available pectinases are highly active at temperatures approximately 50 degrees C and poorly active at temperatures below 35 degrees C, which is the reason why there is a constant search for cold-active pectinases. In preliminary studies, pectinolytic activity was detected in cold-adapted yeasts and yeast-like microorganisms isolated from Antarctica. The aim of the present work was to characterize pectinases secreted by these microorganisms and to express the best candidate in Pichia pastoris.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> Degradation of pectin by extracellular protein extracellular extracts obtained from 12 yeast cultures were assayed in plates at 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C and pH from 5.4 to 7.0, obtaining positive results in samples obtained from Dioszegia sp., Phenoliferia glacialis and Tetracladium sp. An enzyme was purified from Tetracladium sp., analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting and compared to genome and transcriptome data from the same microorganism. Thus, the encoding gene was identified corresponding to a polygalacturonase-encoding gene. The enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the recombinant polygalacturonase displayed higher activity at 15 degrees C than a mesophilic counterpart.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Extracellular pectinase activity was found in three yeast and yeast-like microorganisms from which the highest activity was displayed by Tetracladium sp., and the enzyme was identified as a polygalacturonase. The recombinant polygalacturonase produced in P. pastoris showed high activity at 15 degrees C, representing an attractive candidate to be applied in clarification processes in the production of fermented beverages and fruit juices.</p></details></div>

In this study, we developed and characterized a novel monoclonal S1P1 antibody. Mice were immunized with S1P1 produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris and nine hybridoma clones producing monoclonal antibodies were created. Using different technical approaches including Western blot, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry, we show that a selected clone, hereinafter referred to as 2B9, recognizes human and mouse S1P1 in various cell lineages. The interaction between 2B9 and S1P1 is specific over receptor subtypes, as the antibody does not binds to S1P2 or S1P5 receptors. Using cell-imaging methods, we demonstrate that 2B9 binds to an epitope located at the intracellular domain of S1P1; reveals cytosolic and membrane localization of the endogenous S1P1; and receptor internalization upon S1P or FTY720-P stimulation. Finally, loss of 2B9 signal upon knockdown of endogenous S1P1 by specific small interference RNAs further confirms its specificity. 2B9 was also able to detect S1P1 in human kidney and spinal cord tissue by immunohistochemistry. Altogether, our results suggest that 2B9 could be a useful tool to detect, quantify or localize low amounts of endogenous S1P1 in various physiological and pathological processes.</p></details></div>

Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the genes involved in sea cucumber reproductive processes. The neurohormone relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide (RGP) has been identified as the active gonad-stimulating peptide in sea stars (Asteroidea), which could also be present in other echinoderm groups. In this study, a sea cucumber RGP was identified and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. A recombinant Holothuria scabra RGP was produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris and confirmed by mass spectrometry. To assess bioactivity, four levels of purification were tested in an in vitro germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) bioassay. The most pure form induced 98.56 +/- 1.19% GVBD in H. scabra and 89.57 +/- 1.19% GVBD in Holothuria leucospilota. Cruder levels of purification still resulted in some GVBD. Upon single injection into female H. scabra, the recombinant RGP induced head waving behavior followed by spawning within 90-170 min. Spawned oocytes were fertilized successfully, larvae settled and developed into juveniles. Our results provide a key finding for the development of a break-through new artificial breeding approach in sea cucumber aquaculture.</p></details></div>

Translational pausing coordinates protein translation and co-translational folding. Decelerating translation elongation speed has been shown to improve the soluble protein yield when expressing heterologous proteins in industrial expression hosts. However, rational redesign of translational pausing via synonymous mutations may not be feasible in many cases. Our goal was to develop a general and convenient strategy to improve heterologous protein synthesis in Pichia pastoris without mutating the expressed genes. Results: Here, a large-scale deletion library of ribosomal protein (RP) genes was constructed for heterologous protein expression in Pichia pastoris, and 59% (16/27) RP deletants have significantly increased heterologous protein yield. This is due to the delay of 60S subunit assembly by deleting non-essential ribosomal protein genes or 60S subunit processing factors, thus globally decreased the translation elongation speed and improved the co-translational folding, without perturbing the relative transcription level and translation initiation. Conclusion: Global decrease in the translation elongation speed by RP deletion enhanced co-translational folding efficiency of nascent chains and decreased protein aggregates to improve heterologous protein yield. A potential expression platform for efficient pharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes production was provided without synonymous mutation.</p></details></div>

In this research, an alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA) enzyme was expressed in Pichia pastoris for digestion of the A blood antigen. DNA sequence of the gene NAGA, originally expressed in Elizabethkingia meningosepticum (NAGA-EM), was ordered for optimization and synthesis. It was then expressed in P. pastoris (KM71H and GS115 strains). Expression of the recombinant NAGA was evaluated by dot blot, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. The activity of the enzyme was measured using a synthetic substrate in addition to the conversion of group A red blood cells to the O cells. Expression of NAGA-EM with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa was verified by dot blot, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The maximum enzyme activity in the supernatant of KM71H was higher than that in the GS115 (250 vs. 200 U/ml). Treated group A RBCs did not react with the anti-A antiserum or with the sera from individuals with blood groups B and O.

To date, expression hosts for purification of AID/APOBEC3 enzymes include bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Here the establishment and optimization of a yeast expression/secretion system for AID/APOBEC3s are reported, followed by comparison with the same enzymes expressed in bacterial and mammalian hosts. AID and APOBEC3G were expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, each either with an N-terminal GST tag, C-terminal V5-His tag or as untagged native form. It was verified that the yeast-expressed enzymes exhibit identical biochemical properties to those reported using bacterial and mammalian expression, indicating high fidelity of protein folding. It was demonstrated that the system can be adapted for secretion of the enzymes into the media which was used directly in various enzyme assays. The system is also amenable to elimination of bulky fusion tags, providing native untagged enzymes. Thus, P. pastoris is an advantageous expression factory for AID/APOBEC3 enzymes, considering the cost, time, efficiency and quality of the obtained enzymes. The first report is also provided here of a functionally active, untagged, secreted AID, which may become a useful research reagent.

The E. coli SHu ffl e system was demonstrated to be superior to P. pastoris in generating high-levels of recombinant proteins that were soluble and stable. In addition, protein extracts from P. pastoris induced non-specific chlorosis on wheat, postulated to be caused by co-purified glucanases secreted by the host. Up to 79.6 mug/ml of ToxB was obtained using the SHu ffl e system in the absence of the native signal peptide, whilst the ToxA yield was considerably lower at 3.2 mug/ml. Results indicated that a histidine tag at the ToxA C-terminus interfered with effector functionality. Heterologously expressed ToxA and ToxB were tested on a panel of Australian cereals, including 122 varieties of bread wheat, 16 durum, 20 triticale and 5 barley varieties, as well as common plant model species including tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana.

However, the enzyme displayed two electrophoretic forms due to heterogeneity of N-glycosylation at Asn354. The deglycosylation mutant N354D shared the same properties with wild-type AgdB. N354D demonstrated hydrolytic specificity toward alpha-(1-->3)- and alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic linkages, indicating that AgdB is an alpha-1,3-/alpha-1,4-glucosidase. N354D-catalyzed transglucosylation from maltose was analyzed in short- and long-term reactions, enabling us to learn the transglucosylation specificity and product accumulation, respectively.

Alternative Saccharomyces cerevisiae ASNase II coded by the ASP3 gene was biosynthesized by recombinant Pichia pastoris MUT (s) under the control of the AOX1 promoter, using different cultivation strategies. In particular, we applied multistage fed-batch cultivation divided in four distinct phases to produce ASNase II and determine the fermentation parameters, namely specific growth rate, biomass yield, and enzyme activity. Cultivation of recombinant P. pastoris under favorable conditions in a modified defined medium ensured a dry biomass concentration of 31 gdcw.L(-1) during glycerol batch phase, corresponding to a biomass yield of 0.77 gdcw.g glycerol - 1 and a specific growth rate of 0.21 h(-1). After 12 h of glycerol feeding under limiting conditions, cell concentration achieved 65 gdcw.L(-1) while ethanol concentration was very low. During the phase of methanol induction, biomass concentration achieved 91 gdcw.L(-1), periplasmic specific enzyme activity 37.1 U.g dcw - 1 , volumetric enzyme activity 3,315 U.L(-1), overall enzyme volumetric productivity 31 U.L(-1).h(-1), while the specific growth rate fell to 0.039 h(-1). Our results showed that the best strategy employed for the ASNase II production was using glycerol fed-batch phase with pseudo exponential feeding plus induction with continuous methanol feeding.</p></details></div>

HATs are composed of two subunits, a heavy and a light subunit, which belong to the solute carrier (SLC) families SLC3 and SLC7. The two subunits are linked by a conserved disulfide bridge. Several human diseases are associated with loss of function or overexpression of specific HATs making them drug targets. The human HAT 4F2hc-LAT2 (SLC3A2-SLC7A8) is specific for the transport of large neutral L-amino acids and specific amino acid-related compounds. Human 4F2hc-LAT2 can be functionally overexpressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and pure recombinant protein purified. Here we present the first cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D-map of a HAT, i.e., of the human 4F2hc-LAT2 complex. The structure could be determined at ~13 A resolution using direct electron detector and Volta phase plate technologies. The 3D-map displays two prominent densities of different sizes. The available X-ray structure of the 4F2hc ectodomain fitted nicely into the smaller density revealing the relative position of 4F2hc with respect to LAT2 and the membrane plane.</p></details></div>

According to the codon bias of Pichia genome, the XynB gene from T. reesei was optimized and synthesized by whole gene assembly to improve its expression level in P. pastoris. Approximately 180 target mutations were successfully introduced into natural XynB. The maximum activity of xylanase (optiXynB) secreted by P. pastoris pPICZaA-optiXynB was 1299 U/mL after 96 h induction. Purified recombinant optiXynB had the molecular weight of 24 kDa. The optiXynB presented highest activity in pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C. The recombinase was highly specific towards birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, and oat-spelt xylan. In the broiler experiment, a total of 200 Arbor Acre broilers (one day old) were randomly allocated into four groups fed with basal diets containing 0 (control group), 500, 1000, and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB. Dietary 1000 and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB significantly increased (p < 0.05) final weight and body weight gain; dietary 500, 1000, and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB significantly increased (p < 0.05) pre-evisceration weight, dressed percentage, and eviscerated weight compared with the control group. Inclusion of optiXynB in broiler diets linearly increased final weight, body weight gain, breast muscle weight and leg muscle weight, but linearly decreased feed conversion rate (p < 0.05). Furthermore, inclusion of optiXynB in broiler diets linearly and quadratically increased pre-evisceration weight, dressed percentage, and eviscerated weight (p < 0.05). The recombinant optiXynB from P. pastoris pPICZaA-optiXynB was beneficial in improving growth performance and carcass characteristics of broilers.</p></details></div>

The crude culture supernatant was directly used for coatings of polystyrene multi-well plates without additional treatments, a procedure that resulted in a less time-consuming and chemicals reduction. Furthermore, the gene fusion yielded a positive effect with respect to the wild-type recombinant enzyme in terms of both immobilization and stability. The multi-well plate with the immobilized chimera was used to develop an optical biosensor to monitor two phenolic compounds: L-DOPA ((S)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid) and caffeic acid (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid); the estimation of which is a matter of interest in the pharmaceutics and food field. The method was based on the use of the analytes as competing inhibitors of the laccase-mediated ABTS oxidation.

Glucuronoyl esterases are considered to play a unique role as accessory enzymes in lignocellulosic material biodegradation by cleaving the covalent ester linkage between 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) and lignin in lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs). Two glucuronoyl esterases from T. terrestris named TtGE1 and TtGE2 were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Both esterases displayed features of thermophilic enzymes, with the optimal temperature at 45 degrees C and 55 degrees C. TtGE1 and TtGE2 exhibited activity towards methyl (4-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranosid) uronate (Me-GlcA-pNP) but no catalytic activity to benzyl-D-glucuronate (BnzGlcA), indicating the difference in substrate specificity from previously studied fungal GEs. A substantial increase in the release of monomeric sugars and glucuronic acid from autohydrolysis of corn bran was observed by the supplementing TtGEs into commercial xylanase; the results clearly demonstrated that the TtGEs played a significant role in this degradation process. This research on TtGEs enriches our knowledge of this novel class of fungal GEs. These newly characterized TtGEs could be used as promising accessory enzymes to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of commercial enzymes in saccharification of lignocellulosic materials due to their thermophilic characteristics.</p></details></div>

They are important immune factors resisting pathogenic bacteria infection for mollusks. The 43 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminal for Crassostrea gigas defensin (CgD) form its mature peptide region, responsible for the biological activity of CgD. First, two target genes, CgDH(+) (with 6xHis-tag at 3' end) and CgDH- (without 6xHis-tag at 3' end) were separated and amplified by RT-PCR with specific primers from Crassostrea gigas mantle. These two target genes were ligated to the expression vector pPICZalphaA to construct recombinant expression vectors, pPICZalphaA-CgDH(+) and pPICZalphaA-CgDH-, which were transformed into competent Pichia pastoris X-33 cells by electroporation respectively. The recombinant target proteins, CgDH(+) and CgDH-, were induced for 72 h with 1% methanol at 29 degrees C and 250 r/min. The recombinant CgDH(+) (5.78 kDa) was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis, demonstrating that it was the expected target protein. Based on the concentration of the purified product, the estimated yield of recombinant CgDH(+) was 2.32 mg/L. Antimicrobial assay showed that the culture medium supernatant containing recombinant CgDH(+) and recombinant CgDH-, respectively, had activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that the existence of 6xHis tag in the recombinant proteins do not affect their biological activities.</p></details></div>

In order to explore the effect of the changes of tRNAs corresponding to rare codons (rarity tRNAs) on the expression of exogenous genes, the co-expression system of rare tRNA gene and exogenous gene in Pichia pastoris was constructed. The expression of GFP in P. pastoris can be greatly reduced when a repressor region composed of four continuous proline rare codon CCG was added into the GFP gene. The expression amount of the repressed GFP could be increased about 4.9% when tRNAProCCG gene was cointegrated to the 3' of the repressed GFP gene through pPIC9K to the genome of P. pastoris GS115. Meanwhile, the expression amount of the repressed GFP increased about 12.5% by integrating the repressed GFP gene and tRNAProCCG gene to the genome of P. pastoris GS115 through pPIC9K and pFLDalpha, respectively. Using the same method, NFATc3T-GFP fusion gene and tRNAProCCG gene were co-expressed in P. pastoris GS115 resulting in 21.3% increased of the expression amount of NFATc3T-GFP fusion protein. In conclusion, tRNAProCCG gene has been confirmed to be a kind of rare tRNAs in P. pastoris GS115. Through co-expression of tRNAProCCG gene and heterologous genes which containing the continuous rare codon CCG, the expression of the repressed heterologous genes could be increased significantly.

A prominent promoter system for recombinant protein production in P. pastoris is the promoter of alcohol oxidase (PAOX1) which is induced by methanol, but repressed by several other carbon sources, like glucose and glycerol. Thus, typical cultivation strategies for such P. pastoris strains describe two different phases: growth on a carbon source, like glycerol, to get a high biomass concentration, followed by the induction of recombinant protein production by methanol. However, cells barely grow on methanol resulting in only moderate productivity in such bioprocesses. To enhance productivity, it is common to employ mixed substrate feeding strategies. The knowledge of certain strain-specific parameters is required to be able to set up such mixed feed fed-batch cultivations to avoid methanol accumulation and guarantee highest productivity.

However, due to their unique physical properties and requirement for association with cellular membranes, expression in heterologous systems is often daunting. In this chapter we describe how to engineer the yeast Pichia pastoris to obtain humanized sterol compositions. By implementing some simple genetic engineering approaches, P. pastoris can be reprogrammed to mainly produce cholesterol instead of ergosterol. We show how to apply mass spectrometry to confirm the production of cholesterol instead of ergosterol and how we have further analyzed the strain by electron microscopy. Finally, we delineate how to apply and test the cholesterol-forming P. pastoris strain for functional expression of mammalian Na,K-ATPase alpha3beta1 isoform. Na,K-ATPases have been shown to specifically interact with cholesterol and phospholipids, and, obviously, the presence of cholesterol instead of ergosterol was the key to stabilizing correct localization and activity of this ion transporter.</p></details></div>

Komagataella spp.) include overexpression of endogenous and heterologous genes and deletion of host genes. For efficient gene deletion, methods such as the split-marker technique have been established. However, synthetic biology trends move toward building up large and complex reaction networks, which often require endogenous gene knockouts and simultaneous overexpression of individual genes or whole pathways. Realization of such engineering tasks by conventional approaches employing subsequent steps of transformations and marker recycling is very time- and labor-consuming. Other applications require tagging of certain genes/proteins or promoter exchange approaches, which are hard to design and construct with conventional methods. Therefore, efficient systems are required that allow precise manipulations of the P. pastoris genome, including simultaneous overexpression of multiple genes. To meet this challenge, we have developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based kit for gene insertions, deletions, and replacements, which paves the way for precise genomic modifications in P. pastoris. In this chapter, the versatile method for performing these modifications without the integration of a selection marker is described. A ready-to-use plasmid kit for performing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in P. pastoris based on the GoldenPiCS modular cloning vectors is available at Addgene as CRISPi kit (#1000000136).</p></details></div>

It grows rapidly on inexpensive media containing methanol, glucose, glycerol, or ethanol as a sole carbon source. P. pastoris makes many posttranslational modifications and produces recombinant proteins either intracellularly or extracellularly. Because of these properties, P. pastoris has become a highly preferred host organism for biotechnology, pharmaceutical industry, and researchers.Recombinant protein production is usually performed under the control of the promoter of the alcohol oxidase gene I (AOX1). The AOX1 promoter is induced by methanol and repressed by glucose and ethanol. The regulation mechanisms of the AOX1 promoter have been studied in recent years. Another promoter used in recombinant protein production is derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP). It is a constitutive promoter. Recent literature showed that newly identified promoters of P. pastoris are promising as well, in addition to pAOX1 and pGAP.In this chapter, the regulation mechanisms of inducible pAOX1 and constitutive pGAP promoters are discussed. In addition, here we present an overview about the novel ADH3 promoter and alternative promoters of P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Continuing special needs of each targeted product and different requirements of bioprocess operations have led to identification of different yeast expression systems. Modern bioprocess engineering and advances in omics technology, i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, secretomics, and interactomics, allow the design of novel genetic tools with fine-tuned characteristics to be used for research and industrial applications. This chapter focuses on established and upcoming yeast expression platforms that have exceptional characteristics, such as the ability to utilize a broad range of carbon sources or remarkable resistance to various stress conditions. Besides the conventional yeast S. cerevisiae, established yeast expression systems including the methylotrophic yeasts Pichia pastoris and Hansenula polymorpha, the dimorphic yeasts Arxula adeninivorans and Yarrowia lipolytica, the lactose-utilizing yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and upcoming yeast platforms, namely, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Candida utilis, and Zygosaccharomyces bailii, are compiled with special emphasis on their genetic toolbox for recombinant protein production.</p></details></div>

However, due to its toxicity and flammability, there is a desire to avoid methanol while maintaining the high productivity of P. pastoris. Small scale bioreactor cultivations (0.5-5 L working volume) are commonly used to evaluate a strain and its protein production characteristics since microscale cultivation in deep well plates can be hardly controlled or relies on expensive equipment. Furthermore, traditional protocols for the cultivation and induction of P. pastoris were established for constitutive expression or methanol induction and so far, no reliable protocols were described to screen P. pastoris expression strains with derepressible promoters in (controlled and monitored) parallel cultivations. To simplify such initial cultivations to characterize and compare new protein production strains, we established a simple shake flask cultivation system for methanol free expression that simulates bioreactor conditions including a constant slow glycerol feed and online monitoring, thereby coming closer to the real conditions in bioreactors compared to mostly applied small scale batch cultivations. To drive recombinant protein expression in P. pastoris, the carbon source repressed promoters PDC and PDF were applied. Polymer discs with embedded carbon source, releasing a constant amount of glycerol, assured a feed rate delivering the necessary energy for maintaining the promoters active while keeping the biomass generation low.</p></details></div>

The most effective method of protection against influenza virus and the way to reduce the risk of epidemic or pandemic spread is vaccination. Influenza vaccine manufactured in a traditional way, though well developed, has some drawbacks and limitations which have stimulated interest in developing alternative approaches. In this study, we demonstrate that the recombinant H1 vaccine based on the hydrophilic haemagglutinin (HA) domain and produced in the yeast system elicited high titres of serum haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in mice. Transmission electron microscopy showed that H1 antigen oligomerizes into functional higher molecular forms similar to rosette-like structures. Analysis of the N-linked glycans using mass spectrometry revealed that the H1 protein is glycosylated at the same sites as the native HA. The recombinant antigen was secreted into a culture medium reaching approximately 10 mg/l. These results suggest that H1 produced in Pichia pastoris can be considered as the vaccine candidate against H1N1 virus.</p></details></div>

A recombinant strain designated X33-T23 with the highest activity (1020 U/mL in shake flasks) amongst 216 recombinant colonies was selected for further investigations. To further increase the production of TDL, nine different secretion helper factor genes were transformed in the recombinant strain, X33-T23. The recombinant strain co-expression with the gene encoding protein disulfide isomerase, designated X33-T23-PDI, exhibited the highest activity in shake flasks (1760 U/mL) and in 5 L bioreactor (57521 U/mL) which were 1.67- and 1.46-fold higher, respectively, than for strain X33-T23.

Komagataella spp. ) is one of the strongest promoters for heterologous gene expression. Although increasing the gene dosage is a common strategy to improve recombinant protein productivities, P. pastoris strains harboring more than two copies of a Rhizopus oryzae lipase gene (ROL) have previously shown a decrease in cell growth, lipase production, and substrate consumption, as well as a significant transcriptional downregulation of methanol metabolism. This pointed to a potential titration effect of key transcriptional factors methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1) and methanol-induced transcription factor (Mit1) regulating methanol metabolism caused by the insertion of multiple expression vectors. To prove this hypothesis, a set of strains carrying one and four copies of ROL (1C and 4C, respectively) were engineered to coexpress one or two copies of MXR1*, coding for an Mxr1 variant insensitive to repression by 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, or one copy of MIT1. Small-scale cultures revealed that growth, Rol productivity, and methanol consumption were improved in the 4C-MXR1* and 4C-MIT1, strains growing on methanol as a sole carbon source, whereas only a slight increase in productivity was observed for re-engineered 1C strains.

Tachyplesin I (TP-I) is an antimicrobial peptide, which exhibits potent and broad-spectrum activities against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and tumor cells. However, limited amounts of TP-I produced in horseshoe crab restrict its large-scale use. In order to solve this problem, a eukaryotic expression system of Pichia pastoris with high TP-I expression was constructed by gene engineering. To achieve high expression of TP-I, 74 amino acid-long peptide (4TP-1) was designed containing 4 copies of TP-I, and specific cleavage sites for pancreatic elastase (-Ala downward arrow or -Gly downward arrow) and carboxypeptidase A (cleaves C terminal amino acid); these cleavage sites for enzymes were located between the four copies of TP-I. The gene sequence for the designed peptide was synthesized taking into consideration codon preferences for P. pastoris, and cloned into the highly efficient expression vector pGAPZalpha B. Host Pichia pastoris strain GS115cells were transfected by the constructed expression vector pGAPZalpha B-4tp-I by electroporation. Tricine-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was carried out to detect the expression of target peptides in the fermentation medium. This analysis showed a protein band of 3.3kDa, identical to that of chemically synthesized TP-I, verifying that successful synthesis and secretion of TP-I by genetically engineered P. pastoris. The concentration of TP-I in the fermentation broth was 27.24-29.53mg/L. High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis documented that the TP-I monomer had the same molecular weight, 2262.85, as the designed 17-amino acid sequence. The recombinant TP-I peptide displayed different levels of bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, the present study demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high levels of expression of TP-I in P. pastoris.</p></details></div>

Expressions of FBP1 and TAL2 were upregulated by non-fermentative carbon sources, especially methanol was the best inducer for them, and FBA2 was induced only by methanol. On the other hand, FBA1, TAL1 and TKL1 showed constitutive expression. Strain fbp1Delta showed severe growth defect on methanol and non-fermentable carbon sources, and growth rate of strain fba2Delta in methanol medium was slightly decreased.

To improve the expression efficiency of SsAet in P. pastoris, codon optimization was conducted to obtain the strain GPAp. Here, we report that Ala-Gln production by GPAp was approximately 2.5-fold more than that of GPA. The optimal induction conditions (cultivated for 3 days at 26 degrees C with a daily 1.5% of methanol supplement), the optimum reaction conditions (28 degrees C and pH 8.5), and the suitable substrate conditions (AlaOMe/Gln = 1.5/1) were also achieved for GPAp. Although most of the metal ions had no effects, the catalytic activity of GPAp showed a slight decrease in the presence of Fe(3+) and an obvious increase when cysteine or PMSF were added. Under the optimum conditions, the Ala-Gln generation by GPAp realized the maximum molar yield of 63.5% and the catalytic activity of GPAp by agar embedding maintained extremely stable after 10 cycles.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Characterized by economy, efficiency and practicability, production of Ala-Gln by recycling immobilized GPAp (whole-cell biocatalyst) is represents a green and promising way in industrial.</p></details></div>

Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT), responsible for the last step of triacylglycerol synthesis in the acyl-CoA-independent pathway, has attracted much attention by catalyzing membrane lipid transformation. However, due to lack of biochemical and enzymatic studies, PDAT has not carried forward in biocatalyst application. Here, the PDAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified enzymes were studied using different acyl donors and acceptors by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography. In addition of the preferred acyl donor of PE and PC, the results identified that ScPDAT was capable of using broad acyl donors such as PA, PS, PG, MGDG, DGDG, and acyl-CoA, and ScPDAT was more likely to use unsaturated acyl donors comparing 18:0/18:1 to 18:0/18:0 phospholipids. With regard to acyl acceptors, ScPDAT preferred 1,2 to 1,3-diacylglycerol (DAG), while 12:0/12:0 DAG was identified as the optimal acyl acceptor, followed by 18:1/18:1 and 18:1/16:0 DAG.

Molecular mass of purified TdAmyA was 61.2kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 59.2kDa by gel filtration. TdAmyA was a glycoprotein with 5.3% (w/w) of carbohydrate. TdAmyA exhibited maximal activity at 60 degrees C and pH6.5, and was thermostable up to 55 degrees C within pH4.5-10.0. It was more active towards linear starchy substrates than branched ones. The hydrolysis products were mainly comprised of maltose and maltotriose. TdAmyA produced the highest maltose content of 51.8% after 8h hydrolysis. Thus, TdAmyA might be a candidate alpha-amylase for maltose syrup production.</p></details></div>

Various optimization strategies of processes based on AOX1 promoter have been investigated, including methanol co-feeding with glycerol or sorbitol during the induction stage. Compared with carbon sources, comparatively little research has been devoted to the effects of nitrogen sources. Several reports have described the benefits of adding casamino acids (CA) to the recombinant protein production medium, however, without considering its effects at the gene expression level. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter protein, monitored using flow cytometry, CA was shown to downregulate AOX1 promoter induction. Despite higher growth rates, cultures containing CA exhibited slower transition to the induced state, whereas metabolite analysis revealed that methanol consumption was reduced in the presence of CA compared with its absence. The repressive effect of CA was further confirmed by analysing the synthesis of extracellular recombinant Candida antarctica lipase under control of the AOX1 promoter. These findings highlight nitrogen source selection as an important consideration for AOX1-based protein production.</p></details></div>

Since ester bonds are destroyed during the alkali extraction process, xylanase and arabinofuranosidase are mainly used to hydrolyze xylooligosaccharides. However, alkali extraction costs are very high, and the method also causes pollution. Therefore, this study focuses on elucidating a method to efficiently and directly degrade destarched wheat bran. First, an acidic acetyl xylan esterase (AXE) containing a carbohydrate-binding module-1 (CBM1) domain was cloned from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Characterization showed that the full-length acetyl xylan esterase AXE + CBM1 was similar toe uncovered AXE with an optimum temperature and pH of 55 degrees C and 6.5, respectively. Testing the acetyl xylan esterase and xylanase derived from Neocallimastix patriciarum in a starch-free wheat bran cooperative experiment revealed that AXE + CBM1 and AXE produced 29% and 16% reducing sugars respectively, compared to when only NPXYN11 was used. In addition, introduced the CBM1 domain into NPXYN11, and the results indicated that the CBM1 domain showed little effect on NPXYN11 properties. Finally, the systematically synergistic effects between acetyl xylan esterase and xylanase with/without the CBM1 domain demonstrated that the combined ratio of AXE + CBM1 coming in first and NPXYN11 + CBM1 s increased reducing sugars by almost 35% with AXE and NPXYN11. Furthermore, each component's proportion remained the same with respect to xylooligosaccharides, with the largest proportion (86%) containing of 49% xylobiose and 37% xylotriose.</p></details></div>

Clinical illness following dengue virus infection can either be mild and self-limiting dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, with potentially fatal consequences. A live attenuated vaccine known as Dengvaxia, developed by Sanofi, was licensed in 2015. Following this, long-term follow-up of the Sanofi phase III efficacy trial participants has revealed potential safety concerns. This vaccine, which appears to predispose dengue-naive recipients to an increased risk of hospitalization in the future, is recommended by the World Health Organization only for adults with a history of prior dengue virus infection. A safe and efficacious dengue vaccine continues to be sought globally. India has joined these efforts in recent years, and is poised to initiate the clinical development of two candidates in the near future, one licensed from abroad and the other developed indigenously.

Previous studies have shown that PLRA3 in Pichia pastoris is a strong rhamnose-inducible promoter for driving the industrial production of recombinant proteins. However, another important profile of PLRA3, the basal transcription, was not investigated yet. In this study, the basal transcription of PLRA3 was assessed according to the profiles of two test strains grown in media lacking rhamnose: (1) the production of secretory beta-galactosidase in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-LacB, in which lacB expression was regulated by PLRA3, and (2) growth in P. pastoris GS115/PLRA3-MazF, in which the expression of mazF, which encodes an intracellular toxic protein, was controlled by PLRA3. Analyses revealed low beta-galactosidase production and non-obviously inhibited growth of the test strains, which suggests that there was a low basal transcription level of PLRA3 when rhamnose was absent. Thus, PLRA3 was an excellent candidate for genetic manipulation in P. pastoris due to its strict regulation, a strong and a low transcriptional activity with and without rhamnose, respectively. Subsequently, two systems were developed based on PLRA3 in P. pastoris: (1) an efficient markerless gene deletion system for single or multiple genes and (2) a high efficient piggyBac transposase-mediated mutation system for investigating the functions of unknown genes, as well as for the screening of expected mutants.</p></details></div>

GlcNAc has many important physiological functions in organism, which can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis clinically and be used as food antioxidant, infant food additive and diabetic sweetener. Thus, it is very important to develop genetic-engineering strains with high-yield NAGase to hydrolyze chitin into GlcNAc. Here, the NAGase gene of Bacillus subtilis 168 (BsnagZ) was synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris and expressed in P. pastoris. The expression level of BsNagZ in P. pastoris increased over the induced time and the highest activity reached 0.76 U/mL at the 7th day. The recombinant BsNagZ was purified for characterization. The optimal temperature and pH are 60 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. It can both keep over 80% activities after pre-incubation at 55 degrees C for one hour and at 4 degrees C for 12 h from pH 4.5 to 10.0. To further improve the expression level of BsNagZ, a recombinant strain with four copy BsnagZs was screened using a high concentration of zeocin. The highest BsNagZ activity reached 3.2 U/mL at the 12th day, which was fourfold higher than that of single-copy strain. Combined with commercial chitinase CtnSg, GlcNAc can be produced by recombinant BsNagZ when used colloidal chitin as the substrate. Our study highlights that the NAGase was first successfully expressed in P. pastoris and GlcNAc can be produced via NAGase hydrolyzing the colloidal chitin.</p></details></div>

Glycoprotein expression was under the control of the methanol-inducible promoter pAOX1, with secretion being directed by the alpha-mating factor secretion signal. Production of rPstS-1 was carried out in baffled shake flasks (BSFs) and controlled bioreactors. A production up to ~ 46 mg/L of the recombinant protein was achieved in both the BSFs and the bioreactors. The recombinant protein was recovered from the supernatant and purified in three steps, achieving a preparation with 98% electrophoretic purity. The primary and secondary structures of the recombinant protein were characterized, as well as its O-mannosylation pattern.

Nonetheless, the reduced number of carbon atoms and the symmetry of the glycerol molecule has hampered the comprehensive determination of metabolic fluxes when used as the labelled C-source. Moreover, metabolic models typically used for (13)C-based flux balance analysis may be incomplete or misrepresent the actual metabolic network. To circumvent these limitations, we reduced the genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026-v3.0 into a core model and used it for the iterative fitting of metabolic fluxes to the measured mass isotope distribution of proteinogenic amino acids obtained after fractional (13)C labelling of cells with [1,3-(13)C]-glycerol. This workflow allows reliable estimates to be obtained for in vivo fluxes in P. pastoris cells growing on glycerol as sole carbon source, as well as revising previous assumptions concerning its metabolic operation, such as alternative metabolic branches, calculation of energetic parameters and proposed specific cofactor utilisation.</p></details></div>

Interestingly, PDRs are only present in plants and fungi. In contrast to fungi, there are few biochemical studies of plant PDRs and one major reason is that suitable overexpression systems have not been identified. In this study, we evaluate the expression system Pichia pastoris for heterologous overexpression of PDR genes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We successfully cloned and expressed the potential phytohormone transporters PDR2 and PDR8 in P. pastoris. Sucrose gradient centrifugation confirmed that the overexpressed proteins were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane of P. pastoris and initial functional studies demonstrated ATPase activity for WBC1. However, difficulties in cloning and heterologous overexpression might be particular obstacles of the PDR family, since cloning and overexpression of White Brown Complex 1, a half-size transporter of the same ABCG subfamily with comparable domain organization, was more easily achieved.

RNase 1 contains sequons for N-linked glycosylation at Asn34, Asn76, and Asn88 and is N-glycosylated at all three sites in vivo. The effect of N-glycosylation on the structure and function of RNase 1 is unknown. By using an engineered strain of the yeast Pichia pastoris, we installed a heptasaccharide (Man5GlcNAc2) on the side chain of Asn34, Asn76, and Asn88 to produce the authentic triglycosylated form of human RNase 1. As a glutamine residue is not a substrate for cellular oligosaccharyltransferase, we used strategic asparagine-to-glutamine substitutions to produce the three diglycosylated and three monoglycosylated forms of RNase 1. We found that the N-glycosylation of RNase 1 at any position attenuates its catalytic activity but enhances both its thermostability and its resistance to proteolysis. N-Glycosylation at Asn34 generates the most active and stable glycoforms, in accord with its sequon being highly conserved among vertebrate species. These data provide new insight on the biological role of the N-glycosylation of a human secretory enzyme.</p></details></div>

Of the 15 methanol-inducible promoters, formaldehyde dehydrogenase promoter (PFLD1) showed the highest efficiency in driving lipase production, followed by alcohol oxidase 1 (PAOX1) and dihydroxyacetone synthase (PDAS1) promoters. The maximum lipase activity of transformants with PFLD1, PAOX1 and PDAS1 promoters in 5-l bioreactor was 27,076, 24,159 and 22,342 U/ml, respectively. For the nine constitutive promoters, glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol-anchored protein promoter (PGCW14) produced the highest amount of lipases in a medium containing glucose or glycerol as the only carbon source, followed by mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme (P0472) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PGAP) promoters. The maximum lipase yields in 5-l bioreactors under the control of PGCW14, P0472 and PGAP promoters were 17,353, 15,046 and 14,276 U/ml, respectively. The result of this study not only identifies a few highly efficient promoters for the heterologous expression of TDL in P. pastoris, but also casts some insight into the optimization of protein production in heterologous systems.</p></details></div>

They directly act on proteins, affecting structure and function, or through receptor-mediated mechanisms. RAGE, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was identified as a receptor for AGEs. RAGE is involved in chronic inflammation, oxidative stress-based diseases and ageing. The majority of RAGE ligands bind to the VC1 domain. This domain was successfully expressed and secreted by Pichia pastoris. Out of two N-glycosylation sites, one (Asn25) was fully occupied while the other (Asn81) was under-glycosylated, generating two VC1 variants, named p36 and p34. Analysis of N-glycans and of their influence on VC1 properties were here investigated. The highly sensitive procainamide labeling method coupled to ES-MS was used for N-glycan profiling. N-glycans released from VC1 ranged from Man9GlcNAc2- to Man15GlcNAc2- with major Man10GlcNAc2- and Man11GlcNAc2- species for p36 and p34, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that VC1 maintains the same conformation also after removal of N-glycans. Thermal denaturation curves showed that the carbohydrate moiety has a small stabilizing effect on VC1 protein conformation. The removal of the glycan moiety did not affect the binding of VC1 to sugar-derived AGE- or malondialdehyde-derived ALE-human serum albumin. Given the crucial role of RAGE in human pathologies, the features of VC1 from P. pastoris will prove useful in designing strategies for the enrichment of AGEs/ALEs from plasma, urine or tissues, and in characterizing the nature of the interaction.</p></details></div>

These proteins are often highly dynamic and thus benefit from studies by NMR spectroscopy in parallel with complementary crystallographic and cryo-EM analyses. However, such studies are often complicated by a range of practical concerns, including challenges in preparing suitably isotopically labeled membrane protein samples, large sizes of protein/detergent or protein/lipid complexes, and limitations on sample concentrations and stabilities. Here we describe our approach to addressing these challenges via the use of simple eukaryotic expression systems and modified NMR experiments, using the human adenosine A2A receptor as an example. Protocols are provided for the preparation of U-(2)H ((13)C,(1)H-Ile delta1)-labeled membrane proteins from overexpression in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, as well as techniques for studying the fast ns-ps sidechain dynamics of the methyl groups of such samples. We believe that, with the proper optimization, these protocols should be generalizable to other GPCRs and human membrane proteins.</p></details></div>

The enzyme was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71H in a high yield and purified in a single step using anion-exchange chromatography. Homologous molecular modeling of this enzyme identified crucial differences in the enzyme active site that may be responsible for its high selectivity for N-acetylglucosamine substrates compared to fungal beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases from other sources. The enzyme was used in a sequential reaction together with a mutant beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase from Talaromyces flavus with an enhanced synthetic capability, affording a bioactive disaccharide bearing an azido functional group. The azido function enabled an elegant multivalent presentation of this disaccharide on an aromatic carrier. The resulting model glycoconjugate is applicable as a selective ligand of galectin-3 - a biomedically attractive human lectin.

Amounts of biopharmaceutical drugs and industrial enzymes have been successfully produced by fed-batch high-cell-density fermentation (HCDF) of this cell factory. High levels of cell mass in defined media can be easily achieved and therefore large quantities of recombinant proteins with enhanced activities and lower costs can be obtained through HCDF technology. A robust HCDF process makes a successful transition to commercial production. Recently, efforts have been made to increase the heterologous protein production and activity by the HCDF of P. pastoris. However, challenges around selecting a suitable HCDF strategy exist. The high-level expression of a specific protein in P. pastoris is still, at least in part, limited by optimizing the methanol feeding strategy. Here, we review the progress in developments and applications of P. pastoris HCDF strategies for enhanced expression of recombinant proteins. We focus on the methanol induction strategies for efficient fed-batch HCDF in bioreactors, mainly focusing on various stat-induction strategies, co-feeding, and the limited induction strategy. These processes control strategies have opened the door for expressing foreign proteins in P. pastoris and are expected to enhance the production of recombinant proteins.</p></details></div>

RePriceXIP significantly inhibited the activity of GH11 xylanases in a concentration-dependent manner. The optimal inhibitory activity of rePriceXIP on GH11 xylanases (TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526) occurred at 40 degrees C for 30min. The IC50 values of rePriceXIP inhibiting TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 (0.5 U) were 45, 40, and 40nM, respectively. The Ki of rePriceXIP on TfxA_CD214 xylanase was 12.2nM. Increasing the concentration of rePriceXIP did not change Vmax, but increased Km, thereby suggesting that the inhibition was competitive. Analysis of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the Kq values for TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 exceeded 2.0x10(10)Lmol(-1)*s(-1), implying that static quenching occurred.

However, as the tight regulation and methanol dependence of PAOX1 restricts its application, it is necessary to develop a flexible induction system to avoid the problems of methanol without losing the advantages of PAOX1. The availability of synthetic biology tools enables researchers to reprogram the cellular behaviour of P. pastoris to achieve this goal.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The characteristics of PAOX1 are highly related to the expression profile of methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1). In this study, we applied a biologically inspired strategy to reprogram regulatory networks in P. pastoris. A reprogrammed P. pastoris was constructed by inserting a synthetic positive feedback circuit of Mxr1 driven by a weak AOX2 promoter (PAOX2). This novel approach enhanced PAOX1 efficiency by providing extra Mxr1 and generated switchable Mxr1 expression to allow PAOX1 to be induced under glycerol starvation or carbon-free conditions. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of glycerol on PAOX1 was retained because the synthetic circuit was not activated in response to glycerol. Using green fluorescent protein as a demonstration, this reprogrammed P. pastoris strain displayed stronger fluorescence intensity than non-reprogrammed cells under both methanol induction and glycerol starvation. Moreover, with single-chain variable fragment (scFv) as the model protein, increases in extracellular scFv productivity of 98 and 269% were observed in Mxr1-reprogrammed cells under methanol induction and glycerol starvation, respectively, compared to productivity in non-reprogrammed cells under methanol induction.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We successfully demonstrate that the synthetic positive feedback circuit of Mxr1 enhances recombinant protein production efficiency in P. pastoris and create a methanol-free induction system to eliminate the potential risks of methanol.</p></details></div>

HM is elongated by glycosyltransferases (GTs) from the cellulose synthase-like A (CSLA) family. MANNAN-SYNTHESIS RELATED (MSR) putative GTs have also been implicated in (gluco)mannan synthesis, but their roles have been difficult to decipher in planta and in vitro.

The specificity of the antibodies raised against mdFshbeta and mdLhbeta was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) for Fshbeta and Lhbeta on medaka pituitary tissue, while comparison with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for fshb and lhb mRNA was used for validation. Competitive ELISAs were developed using antibodies against mdFshbeta or mdLhbeta, and the tethered proteins mdFshbetaalpha or mdLhbetaalpha for standard curves. The standard curve for the Fsh ELISA ranged from 97.6pg/ml to 50ng/ml, and for the Lh ELISA from 12.21pg/ml to 6.25ng/ml. The sensitivity of the assays for Fsh and Lh was 44.7 and 70.8pg/ml, respectively. A profile of pituitary protein levels of medaka Fsh and Lh comparing juveniles with adults showed significant increase of protein amount from juvenile group (body length from 12mm to 16.5mm) to adult group (body length from 21mm to 26.5mm) for both hormones in male medaka. Comparing these data to a developmental profile of pituitary mRNA expression of medaka fshb and lhb, the mRNA expression of lhb also increased during male maturation and a linear regression analysis revealed a significant increase of lhb expression with increased body length that proposes a linear model. However, fshb mRNA expression did not change significantly during male development and therefore was not correlated with body length. In summary, we have developed and validated homologous ELISA assays for medaka Fsh and Lh based on proteins produced in P. pastoris, assays that will be used to study the functions and regulations of Fsh and Lh in more detail.</p></details></div>

The recombinant xylanase from Lentinula edodes (rLeXyn11A) was produced in Pichia pastoris. The optimal temperature and pH for rLeXyn11A were 40 degrees C and 4.0, respectively. The rLeXyn11A featured resistance to high temperature and showed broad temperature adaptability (>50% of the maximum activity at 20-80 degrees C).

Furthermore, our novel CFPS platform can produce complex therapeutic proteins, as exemplified by the production of human serum albumin to a final yield of 48.1 mug ml (-1) . Therefore, this study not only adds to the growing number of CFPS systems from diverse organisms but also provides a blueprint for rapidly engineering new strains with increased productivity in vitro that could be applied to other organisms.</p></details></div>

Since the process dynamics typically exhibit nonlinear interactions amongst the critical process variables, the commonly employed controllers are suboptimal for control of most bioprocesses. In this article, we present the implementation of an augmented controller for improving the production of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) using Pichia pastoris. The augmented controller consists of a decoupled adaptive control (DAC) and a decoupled input-output linearizing control (DIOLC) in a combined architecture that permits simultaneous control of substrate concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration, sampled at different rates during fed-batch fermentation. The performance of DAC-DIOLC controller was compared to the performance of DAC and DIOLC implemented individually on the process. Our results show that the augmented controller better regulates the substrate and dissolved oxygen (DO), along the desired control trajectory compared to the individual DAC and DIOLC controllers. The performance of the augmented DAC-DIOLC controller showed deviations of only 0.021 g/L from substrate set point compared to 0.09 g/L in PID and 0.031 g/L in DIOLC, and a 1.12% deviation from DO set point compared to 11.86% in PID and 2.58% in DAC. Overall, stricter control achieved using the augmented controller resulted in a 1.5 fold increase in rHSA production.</p></details></div>

However, little is known about the similarities and differences between different Ganoderma FIPs' bioactivities. In the current study, two FIP genes termed FIP-gap1 and FIP-gap2 from G. applanatum, along with LZ-8 and FIP-gsi, another two representative Ganoderma FIP genes from G. lucidum and G. sinense were functionally expressed in Pichia. Subsequently, bioactivities of four recombinant Ganoderma FIPs were demonstrated and compared.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> All the four Ganoderma FIP genes could be effectively expressed in P. pastoris GS115 at expression levels ranging from 197.5 to 264.3 mg L(- 1) and simply purified by one step chromatography using HisTrap FF prepack columns. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that they all possessed the FIP conserved fragments. The homologies of different Ganoderma FIPs were from 72.6 to 86.4%. In vitro haemagglutination exhibited that FIP-gap1, FIP-gsi and LZ-8 could agglutinate human, sheep and mouse red blood cells but FIP-gap2 agglutinated none. Besides, the immunomodulation activities of these Ganoderma FIPs were as: rFIP-gap2 > rFIP-gap1 > rLZ-8 and rFIP-gsi in terms of proliferation stimulation and cytokine induction on murine splenocytes. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of different FIPs was: rFIP-gap1 > rLZ-8 > rFIP-gsi > rFIP-gap2, examined by their inhibition of three human carcinomas A549, Hela and MCF-7.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Taken together, four typical Ganoderma FIP genes could be functionally expressed in P. pastoris, which might supply as feasible efficient resources for further study and application. Both similarities and differences were indeed observed between Ganoderma FIPs in their amino acid sequences and bioactivities. Comprehensively, rFIP-gaps from G. applanatum proved to be more effective in immunomodulation and cytotoxic assays in vitro than rLZ-8 (G. lucidum) and rFIP-gsi (G. sinense).</p></details></div>

In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of the nuclease from extremely psychrophilic bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii that grows exponentially at 5 degrees C, but may also grow at even lower temperatures (down to - 12 degrees C). The putative endonuclease I gene, identified in the genome of P. ingrahamii, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein was purified and its nucleolytic features were studied. The new enzyme, named by us as PinNuc, displays the features characteristic for the nonselective endonucleases, and has the ability to degrade different forms of nucleic acids. It is very active at room temperature in low ion-strength buffer and in the presence of low concentrations of magnesium ions. The enzyme, which possesses six cysteine residues, the most likely all engaged in disulphide bridges, is active only in oxidized form, and can be efficiently inactivated by the addition of low amounts of a reducing agent. According to our knowledge, it is the first nuclease, belonging to endonuclease I family, isolated from such extremely psychrophilic organism.</p></details></div>

High level of extracellular amylase production of 72 U/mL was obtained after a 72 h induction by methanol. As expected, the recombinant strain produced only the AmyA isoform since the host is a protease deficient strain. Besides, the purified r-AmyA showed a molecular mass of 54 kDa, the same pH optimum equal to 5.6 but a higher thermoactivity of 60 degrees C against 50 degrees C for the native enzyme. Unlike AmyA which maintained 50% of its activity after a 10-min incubation at 60 degrees C, r-AmyA reached 45 min. The higher thermoactivity and thermostability could be related to the N-glycosylation. The r-AmyA activity was enhanced by 46% and 45% respectively in the presence of 4 mM Fe(2+) and Mg(2+) ions. This enzyme was more efficient in bread-making since such ions were reported to have a positive impact on the nutriment quality and the rheological characteristics of the wheat flour dough. The thermoactivity/thermostability as well as the iron and magnesium activations could also be ascribed to the presence of an additional C-terminal loop containing the His tag.</p></details></div>

The 1953 bp lmco gene sequence comprises of 3 exons interrupted by 2 introns and according to the LccED database the translated sequence belongs to superfamily 6 of multicopper oxidases. After removal of the introns, the gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris, under the control of the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter. The heterologous enzyme was purified with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa. TtLMCO1 displayed optimum activity at pH 4 and 50 degrees C and appeared thermostable up to 50 degrees C. A variety of phenolic compounds were oxidized by TtLMCO1, including standard laccase substrates such as ABTS and 2,6 dimethoxyphenol. The UV/Vis spectrum of purified TtLMCO1 indicates that it belongs to yellow laccase-like oxidases. The enzyme was used for the bioconversion of 2',3,4-trihydroxychalcone to 3',4'-dihydroxy-aurone, a bioactive aurone recently shown to possess inhibitory activity against several isoforms of the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC).

This ultimately results in progressive dysfunction and loss of vision either in advanced age for genetically normal patients (age-related macular degeneration) or in adolescence for those with inherited genetic mutations (Stargardt's disease). In this article, we present a proof-of-concept study for an enzyme-based therapy to remove these retinoids, modeled on traditional enzyme replacement therapy. Recombinant manganese peroxidase (rMnP) is produced in Pichia pastoris. In vitro, we demonstrate that rMnP breaks down A2E and other lipofuscin fluorophores with limited cellular toxicity, and as this enzyme is mannosylated, it can be taken up into cells through mannose receptor-dependent endocytosis. In vivo, we demonstrate that rMnP can significantly reduce the A2E burden when administered by intravitreal injections. Together, these data provide encouraging results toward the development of an enzyme-based therapy for macular degeneration and indicate the need for additional work to characterize the molecular mechanism of A2E breakdown and to improve the pharmacological parameters of the enzyme.</p></details></div>

The recombinant P. pastoris was inoculated in to BMMY culture medium, incubation with 5mul/ml absolute methanol for 72hat 30 degrees C. The TC-1 peptide was concentrated with nickel affinity chromatography and electrophoresis on 16% acrylamide gels. The molecular weight of recombinant TC-1 is approximately 8kDa and under these conditions, the concentration of TC-1 considered 190mug/ml that determined by the Bradford method. The antimicrobial activity test (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) was done against: Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of these pathogenic bacteria was limited when we used peptide at a concentration of as low as 19.56mug/ml.

Currently, heparin is mainly extracted from porcine mucosa. However, animal-derived heparin shows low anticoagulant activity due to the low proportion of the anticoagulant active unit, the GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS6S3S-Ido2S-GlcNS6S pentasaccharide. In this study we proposed an enzymatic strategy to sulfate the animal-sourced heparin to increase the proportion of anticoagulant pentasaccharide and the anticoagulant activity. First, three sulfotransferases HS2ST, HS6ST, and HS3ST were expressed tentatively in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. After measuring the sulfotransferase activity, we confirmed P. pastoris GS115 is the better host for sulfotransferases production. Then, the maltose binding protein (MBP) and thioredoxin (TrxA) were fused separately to the N-terminal of sulfotransferases to increase enzyme solubility. As a result, the yields of HS2ST and HS6ST were increased to (839+/-14) U/L and (792+/-23) U/L, respectively. Subsequent sulfation of the animal-sourced heparin with the recombinant HS2ST, HS6ST and HS3ST increased the anticoagulant activity from (76+/-2) IU/mg to (189+/-17) IU/mg.</p></details></div>

S47W secreted from Pichia pastoris was examined for secondary structure and for the formation of a hydrophobic cavity by 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) staining. Monoclonal and human IgE-antibody binding was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Allergen-induced degranulation by human epsilon receptor expressed-rat basophil was determined.

It could also not stimulate IL-8 release from BEAS2B cells. IgE from house dust mite (HDM)-allergic Thais bound S47W with 100-fold weaker avidity, whereas IgE of HDM-allergic Australians did not.

Half a dozen different luciferins, molecules that emit light when enzymatically oxidized, are known. However, just one biochemical pathway for luciferin biosynthesis has been described in full, which is found only in bacteria. Here, we report identification of the fungal luciferase and three other key enzymes that together form the biosynthetic cycle of the fungal luciferin from caffeic acid, a simple and widespread metabolite. Introduction of the identified genes into the genome of the yeast Pichia pastoris along with caffeic acid biosynthesis genes resulted in a strain that is autoluminescent in standard media. We analyzed evolution of the enzymes of the luciferin biosynthesis cycle and found that fungal bioluminescence emerged through a series of events that included two independent gene duplications. The retention of the duplicated enzymes of the luciferin pathway in nonluminescent fungi shows that the gene duplication was followed by functional sequence divergence of enzymes of at least one gene in the biosynthetic pathway and suggests that the evolution of fungal bioluminescence proceeded through several closely related stepping stone nonluminescent biochemical reactions with adaptive roles. The availability of a complete eukaryotic luciferin biosynthesis pathway provides several applications in biomedicine and bioengineering.</p></details></div>

The full-length cDNA sequence of CfLRRop-7 was 1463 bp and contained an open reading frame of 1086 bp, which encoded a protein of 361 amino acids. Five LRR motifs with a conserved signature sequence LxxLxLxxNxL were identified in the predicted protein sequence. The expression of CfLRRop-7 was particularly high in hemocytes. The expression of CfLRRop-7 was relatively high in oocytes and embryos during the ontogenesis of scallops. CfLRRop-7 expression changed in hemocytes in response to stimulation with different microbes, including Vibrio splendidus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pichia pastoris. CfLRRop-7 recognized five kinds of ligands/agonists. CfLRRop-7 recombinant protein inhibited bacterial proliferation in hemolymph and induced lysozyme activity in serum.

N-acetyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can protect yeast cells from damage caused by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oxidative pressure environments such as ethanol treatment, freeze-thawing, or heat shock. In this study, N-acetyltransferase from P. pastoris (PpMpr1) was overexpressed for the first time to improve the anti-oxidative stress ability to protect cells from strong ROS damage during the methanol induction phase. Cell viability of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain increased significantly, while biomass was increased by 22.7% at high dissolved oxygen (DO). At the same time, the heterologous alpha-glucosidase (AGL) expression level at 25% DO was increased by 21.5%. The AGL degradation was greatly relieved in the fermentation supernatant of the PpMpr1 overexpression strain.

The PCV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) are a powerful subunit vaccine that can elicit high immune response due to its native PCV2 virus morphology. The baculovirus expression system is the widely used platform for producing commercial PCV2 VLP vaccines, but its yield and cost limited the development of low-cost vaccines for veterinary applications. Here, we applied a nonconventional yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus to enhance the production of PCV2 VLPs. After codon optimization, the PCV2 Cap protein was expressed in K. marxianus and assemble spontaneously into VLPs. Using a chemically defined medium, we achieved approximately 1.91 g/L of PCV2 VLP antigen in a 5-L bioreactor after high cell density fermentation for 72 h. That yield greatly exceeded to recently reported PCV2 VLPs obtained by baculovirus-insect cell, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.

Additionally, the recombinant expression of nanobodies is robust in various expression systems, such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris. P. pastoris is the most widely used microorganism for nanobody production, but all or almost all expression vectors developed for this system are based on the regulated promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1) that requires methanol for full induction. In this study, a constitutive anti-CEACAM5 nanobody expression system was constructed under the control of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (GAP) promoter. The effects of different carbon sources and pH on nanobody expression were evaluated in shaking flask cultures. After 96h of constitutive expression in shaking flask, a yield of 51.71mg/L was obtained. In addition, this constitutive expression system produced nanobodies at equivalent yield and affinity to that produced by methanol-induced expression. The results of this study indicated that the use of a constitutive expression system is a promising alternative for the production of nanobodies applied for cancer diagnosis and therapy.</p></details></div>

The swollenin from Trichoderma reesei was produced in Pichia pastoris in current study. The recombinant protein caused an obvious disruption on filter paper and slight increase in reducing sugars release when treating xylan, Avicel, rice straw, wheat straw, and corn straw. Simultaneous incubation of swollenin with fibrolytic enzyme resulted in a significant synergistic activity on disruption of filter paper and hydrolysis of above-mentioned substrates. During in vitro rumen fermentation of three straw diets, the dry matter digestibility, acetate production, microbial protein synthesis, and fibrolytic bacterial population were increased by swollenin. This study demonstrates that swollenin could enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis and in vitro ruminal fermentation of agricultural straws, showing the potential of swollenin for improving the utilization of agricultural straws in ruminants.</p></details></div>

Mutations in the human AC gene asah1 are known to cause Farber disease and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Zebrafish AC was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris by inserting asah1b gene into the genome. The majority of the overexpressed enzyme was secreted into the culture medium and purified to apparent homogeneity by stepwise chromatography. The recombinant protein was glycosylated precursor, that further undergoes limited autoproteolytic processing into two subunits (alpha and beta) which are visible in SDS-PAGE. The zebrafish AC is heterodimer associated with an inter-subunit disulfide bond. SDS-PAGE estimated the mass of native enzyme to be approximately 50kDa & size exclusion chromatography estimated the mass of the active enzyme as approximately 100kDa, suggesting the formation of a dimer of heterodimers. The protein was secreted as a mixture of processed and unprocessed forms in the culture media. A preliminary characterization of purified zebrafish AC was done by an enzyme assay. The zebrafish AC expressed in Pichia pastoris would be used for further structural and functional analysis.</p></details></div>

One of the ancestral sources of fungal nutrition could be products following enzymatic degradation of plant material. However, carbohydrate-active enzymes from these ancient fungi have been less studied. A GH11 xylanase (RrXyn11A) (EC 3.2.1.8) and a GH43 xylosidase (RrXyl43A) (EC 3.2.1.37) were identified from an early-lineage aerobic zoosporic fungus, Rhizophlyctis rosea NBRC 105426. Both genes were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant enzymes were purified and characterized. The optimal pH for recombinant RrXyn11A and RrXyl43A was pH 7. RrXyn11A had high stability over a wide range of pH (4-8) and temperature (25-70 degrees C). RrXyn11A also showed high substrate specificity on both azurine-cross-linked (AZCL) arabinoxylan and AZCL xylan. RrXyl43A had beta-xylosidase and minor alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activity. This enzyme showed low product inhibition and retained 51% activity in the presence of 100 mM xylose. A combination of RrXyn11A and RrXyl43A exhibited significantly higher hydrolytic and polymer degradation capability and xylose release on wheat bran and beechwood xylan compared to treatment with commercial enzymes. This study was the first to heterologously express and characterize the GH11 xylanase (RrXyn11A) and GH43 xylosidase (RrXyl43A) from the ancient fungus, R. rosea. Meanwhile, this study also demonstrated that the enzymes from the ancient fungus R. rosea can be easily handled and heterologously expressed in Pichia, which presents a promising path to a new source of enzymes for biomass degradation.</p></details></div>

In the present study, a full-length cDNA sequence of a gC1qR homolog (PtgC1qR) in Portunus trituberculatus was identified. PtgC1qR was a 268-amino-acid polypeptide with a conserved MAM33 domain and a mitochondrial targeting sequence in the first 56 amino acids. The transcripts of PtgC1qR were detected in all examined tissues with the highest level detected in the hepatopancreas. Compared with other early embryonic stages, PtgC1qR was highly expressed in the fertilized eggs and embryos at the cleavage stage, which suggest PtgC1qR may be a maternal gene. The transcripts of PtgC1qR in hemocytes exhibited time-dependent response expression pattern after challenged with bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus) and fungi (Pichia pastoris). Moreover, the recombinant PtgC1qR (rPtgC1qR) exhibited strong antibacterial activity and microbial-binding activity, suggesting its crucial role in immune defense and recognition. Further phenoloxidase (PO) assay showed that rPtgC1qR could suppress the crab PO activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and it could result in nearly 100% inhibition of PO activity under the concentration of 11.65muM. Knockdown of PtgC1qR could significantly enhance the expression of serine protease related genes (PtSP1-3 and PtSPH), proPO-associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and C3-like genes (Ptalpha2M1 and PtTEP). However, the phagocytosis related genes (PtMyosin, PtRab5 and PtArp) and Ptalpha2M2 were significantly down-regulated in the PtgC1qR silenced crabs.

In present study, we identified a crustin gene in Scylla paramamosain, which was named as SpCrus6. The ORF of SpCrus6 possessed a signal peptide sequence (SPS) at the N-terminus and a WAP domain at the C-terminus. And there were 5 Proline residues, 5 Glycine and 4 Cysteine residues between SPS and WAP domain in SpCrus6. These features indicated that SpCrus6 was a new member of crustin family. The SpCrus6 mRNA transcripts were up-regulated obviously after bacteria or virus challenge. These changes showed that SpCrus6 was involved in the antimicrobial and antiviral responses of Scylla paramamosain. Recombinant SpCrus6 (rSpCrus6) showed strong inhibitory abilities against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis). But the inhibitory abilities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio parahemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio harveyi and Escherichia coli) and two fungi (Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans) were not strong enough. Besides, rSpCrus6 could strongly bind to two Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis and B. megaterium) and three Gram-negative bacteria (V. alginolyticus, V. parahemolyticus, and V. harveyi). And the binding levels to S. aureus and two fungi (P. pastoris and C. albicans) were weak. The polysaccharides binding assays' results showed rSpCrus6 had superior binding activities to LPS, LTA, PGN and beta-glucan. Through agglutinating assays, we found rSpCrus6 could agglutinate well three Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, B. subtilis and B. megaterium). And the agglutinating activities to Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were not found. In the aspect of antiviral functions, rSpCrus6 could bind specifically to the recombinant envelop protein 26 (rVP26) of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) but not to recombinant envelop protein 28 (rVP28), whereas GST protein could not bind to rVP26 or rVP28. Besides, rSpCrus6 could suppress WSSV reproduction to some extent.

A beta-1,3-glucanase from wheat was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 and its biochemical and antifungal properties were characterized herein. The molecular weight of recombinant beta-1,3-glucanase is approximately 33 kDa. beta-1,3-glucanase displays optimal activity at pH 6.5, remaining relatively high at pH 5.5-8.0.

Further, the in vitro site-directed mutagenesis of the three putative N-glycosylation sites at asparagine residues 14, 265, and 377 to alanine revealed the essentiality of glycosylation of the 14th amino acid residue in its post-translational proteolytic stability without significantly affecting its biological activity. However, the mutation of both Asn265 and Asn377 did not seem to contribute toward its glycosylation but resulted in a 39% lower specific activity in case of the rSK-N265,377A. Moreover, the mutation of all three glycosylation positions drastically reduced the secretory expression of native streptokinase from 347 to 186.6 mg/L for the triple mutant with a 14% lower specific activity of 56,738 IU/mg from 65,808 IU/mg. The secondary structure, tertiary structure, and thermal transition point (45-55 degrees C) of all the deglycosylated variants did not show any significant differences when compared with fully glycosylated native streptokinase using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, the longer acting plasmin-resistant variants were also developed via the mutation of lysine residues 59 and 386 to glutamine which enhanced its biological stability as a ~ 1.5-fold increase in the caseinolytic zone size was observed in case of rSK-K59Q and also in rSK-K59,386Q mutant without affecting the structural properties.</p></details></div>

On this scenario, the retention of such specific microorganisms in the system is of critical interest; however, the potential limitations of working with simplified cultures in a competitive open environment are neither fully explored nor well understood. In this work, a series of biofilters treating methanol vapors coupled with heterologous endochitinase production were used to evaluate the performance of a specialized microbial population during a typical open-to-environment operation. The biofilters were inoculated with a transformed strain of Pichia pastoris and were operated identically for about 90 days. The results showed that the biofiltration performance became diverse with time in terms of the elimination capacity (EC) shifting from a variation coefficient of 1.5% (EC = 274 +/- 24, 279 +/- 5, and 281.9 +/- 25 g/[m(3) h]) at the beginning of the operation to 33% (EC = 297 +/- 9, 338 +/- 7, and 341 +/- 2 g/[m(3) h]) at the end of operation. Epifluorescence analysis and cloning-sequencing suggested that P. pastoris remained as the dominant microorganism of methanol degradation, whereas diverse airborne bacteria, including Ochrobactrum spp. and Klebsiella oxytoca, played a secondary role possibly associated with the consumption of intermediates. Overall, this study found that low diversity systems operated under non-sterile conditions could be susceptible to contamination with external microorganisms causing a diversifying behavior at the performance and microbial community levels.

Herein, we performed secretory expression of recombinant Tx4(6-1) using Pichia pastoris strain X33 as the host, and screened transformants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In flasks, approximately 5mg/l rTx4(6-1) was expressed as a secreted protein following induction with methanol, and this was increased to 45mg/l rTx4(6-1) in a fed-batch reactor. Approximately 4mg of high-purity rTx4(6-1) was purified from a 400ml fed-batch culture supernatant by Ni(+)-nitriloacetic acid affinity chromatography, followed by carboxymethyl (CM) sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. Purified rTx4(6-1) was determined by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, revealing a molecular weight (MW) of 7660.5Da, larger than the expected size due to O-linked glycosylation. Insect bioactivity tests of rTx4(6-1)-treated fifth-instar silkworm larvae (Bombyx mori Linnaeus) showed neurotoxin symptoms such as contraction paralysis, abdominal contraction, and mouth movement syndrome, with a half lethal dose at 12h post-injection of approximately 4.5-8.5mug/g body weight.

Thus, these enzymes have attracted significant attention as potential biocatalysts. Versatile peroxidases are the most interesting ones, since they comprise activities of manganese and lignin peroxidases. Herein, we demonstrate how the properties of a new manganese peroxidase from Moniliophthora roreri, designated MrMnP1, were shifted towards those of a versatile peroxidase. MrMnP1 was cloned in Pichia pastoris X-33 and highly expressed in a fed-batch fermentation, yielding 132 mg L(-1) of active enzyme. To extend the substrate spectrum of MrMnP1, a catalytically active tryptophan present in lignin and versatile peroxidases was first introduced. Additionally, the role of five amino acids at positions adjacent to the catalytic tryptophan was elucidated through their replacement by those found in a versatile peroxidase from Pleurotus eryngii. The resulting mutants demonstrated new activities towards high-redox-potential substrates, such as lignin dimers, veratryl alcohol, and the azo dye Reactive Black 5.</p></details></div>

Structural comparison with the closest thermophilic endoglucanase homolog, Cel5A from Thermoascus aurantiacus, demonstrates disulfide bond differences. Replacement of Cysteine99 with Valine and Cysteine323 with Histidine by site directed mutagenesis caused elimination of two disulfide bonds. Recombinant expression in Pichia pastoris showed the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) increment toward CMC for single mutant enzymes, C99V and C323H, about 1.87 and 1.3 folded respectively. This indicates that the elimination of disulfide bond in substrate binding cleft around the catalytic domain of mutant EndoglucanaseII may be increased the flexibility of protein, to form a suitable E-S complex. In direct contrast with previous studies suggesting the existence of disulfide bonds increase the protein stability, the results showed mutant endoglucanase enzymes with disulfide bond reduction have higher thermal stability. The thermal stability of C99V and C323H in 80 degrees C were increased 2.4 and 2.34 folded, respectively. In this project, theoretical data had a good agreement with the experimental results. Because of high enzyme activity and thermal stability, both of C99V and C323H mutant have high potential suitable for different industrial applications.</p></details></div>

The success of this transition will require the development of genetically stable production strains, the use of strong constitutive promoters, and the development of new medium formulations that allow an appropriate balance between cell growth and product formation. We identified genes that showed high expression in Komagataella phaffii during different steady-state conditions and explored the utility of promoters of these genes (Chr1-4_0586 and FragB_0052) in optimizing the expression of two different r-proteins, human lysozyme (HuLy), and the anti-idiotypic antibody fragment, Fab-3H6, in comparison with the widely used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Our results showed that the promoter strength was highly dependent on the cultivation conditions and thus constructs should be tested under a range of conditions to determine both the best performing clone and the ideal promoter for the expression of the protein of interest. An important benefit of continuous production is that it facilitates the use of the genome-scale metabolic models in the design of strains and cultivation media. In silico flux distributions showed that production of either protein increased the flux through aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Tyrosine supplementation increased the productivity for both proteins, whereas tryptophan addition did not cause any significant change and, phenylalanine addition increased the expression of HuLy but decreased that of Fab-3H6. These results showed that a genome-scale metabolic model can be used to assess the metabolic burden imposed by the synthesis of a specific r-protein and then this information can be used to tailor a cultivation medium to increase production.</p></details></div>

Nonetheless, they are considered useful biocatalysts in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. The aim of the present work was to characterize a novel PPO and explore its potential as a bioremediation agent. A gene encoding an extracellular tyrosinase-like enzyme was amplified from the genome of Thermothelomyces thermophila and expressed in Pichia pastoris The recombinant enzyme (TtPPO) was purified and biochemically characterized. Its production reached 40 mg/liter, and it appeared to be a glycosylated and N-terminally processed protein. TtPPO showed broad substrate specificity, as it could oxidize 28/30 compounds tested, including polyphenols, substituted phenols, catechols, and methoxyphenols. Its optimum temperature was 65 degrees C, with a half-life of 18.3 h at 50 degrees C, while its optimum pH was 7.5. The homology model of TtPPO was constructed, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed in order to increase its activity on mono- and dichlorophenols (di-CPs). The G292N/Y296V variant of TtPPO 5.3-fold increased activity on 3,5-dichlorophenol (3,5-diCP) compared to the wild type.IMPORTANCE A novel fungal PPO was heterologously expressed and biochemically characterized. Construction of single and double mutants led to the generation of variants with altered specificity against CPs. Through this work, knowledge is gained regarding the effect of mutations on the substrate specificity of PPOs. This work also demonstrates that more potent biocatalysts for the bioremediation of harmful CPs can be developed by applying site-directed mutagenesis.</p></details></div>

In the present work, Lcc9 cDNA was cloned from C. cinerea using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant laccase was found to be a heavily hyperglycoprotein, with the molecular weight of 60.2kDa as determined by MALDI-TOF. Laccase activity in the culture supernatant was 1750+/-83 U/L and reached 3138+/-62 U/L after expression condition optimization using orthogonal experiment. The biochemical property of the purified recombinant Lcc9 (rLcc9) was compared to that of wild-type Lcc9. rLcc9 shows a higher specific activity (315.3 U/mg) than Lcc9 (92.9 U/mg) when using ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sulfonate)) as the substrate. Although rLcc9 and Lcc9 showed comparable optimal pH (6.5) and temperature (70 degrees C) toward syringaldazine, rLcc9 displayed higher activity and stability in the pH range of 6.5-8.5. rLcc9 showed improved ability to oxidize indigo carmine and 5 azo dyes when methyl syringate was used as the mediator, with the decolorization rate range from 71.9+/-3.2% to 99.1+/-1.6% for different dyes in a wide pH (4.5-9.0) and temperature (4-70 degrees C) ranges. In comparison, Lcc9 decolorized 50.3+/-2.1% to 98.2+/-2.0% of the dyes used. The improved activity and stability in alkaline pH of rLcc9 relative to Lcc9, and improved dye decolorization ability towards 6 dyes suggested greater application potential of rLcc9 in biotechnologies such as wastewater treatment.</p></details></div>

Here, the results of an extensive mutagenesis study on three LPMO representatives, Phanerochaete chrysosporium LPMO9D (C1-oxidizer), Neurospora crassa LPMO9C (C4), and Hypocrea jecorina LPMO9A (C1/C4), are reported. Using a previously published indicator diagram, the authors demonstrate that several structural determinants of LPMOs play an important role in their oxidative regioselectivity. N-glycan removal and alterations of the aromatic residues on the substrate-binding surface are shown to alter C1/C4-oxidation ratios. Removing the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) is found not to alter the regioselectivity of HjLPMO9A, although the effect of mutational changes is shown to increase in a CBM-free context. The accessibility to the solvent-exposed axial position of the copper-site reveales not to be a major regioselectivity indicator, at least not in PcLPMO9D. Interestingly, a HjLPMO9A variant lacking two surface exposed aromatic residues combines decreased binding capacity with a 22% increase in synergetic efficiency. Similarly to recent LPMO10 findings, our results suggest a complex matrix of surface-interactions that enables LPMO9s not only to bind their substrate, but also to accurately direct their oxidative force.</p></details></div>

Heterogeneous expression of beta-mannanase in Pichia pastoris systems is widely used; however, Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression systems are more reliable and safer. We optimized beta-mannanase gene from Aspergillus sulphureus and expressed it in five S. cerevisiae strains. Haploid and diploid strains, and strains with constitutive promoter TEF1 or inducible promoter GAL1, were tested for enzyme expression in synthetic auxotrophic or complex medium. Highest efficiency expression was observed for haploid strain BY4741 integrated with beta-mannanase gene under constitutive promoter TEF1, cultured in complex medium. In fed-batch culture in a fermentor, enzyme activity reached ~ 24 U/mL after 36 h, and production efficiency reached 16 U/mL/day. Optimal enzyme pH was 2.0-7.0, and optimal temperature was 60 degrees C. In studies of beta-mannanase kinetic parameters for two substrates, locust bean gum galactomannan (LBG) gave Km = 24.13 mg/mL and Vmax = 715 U/mg, while konjac glucomannan (KGM) gave Km = 33 mg/mL and Vmax = 625 U/mg. One-hour hydrolysis efficiency values were 57% for 1% LBG, 74% for 1% KGM, 39% for 10% LBG, and 53% for 10% KGM. HPLC analysis revealed that the major hydrolysis products were the oligosaccharides mannose, mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose, mannopentaose, and mannohexaose.

Comparison of amino acid sequences of fucosidases reveals that although the nucleophile is conserved among all alpha-l-fucosidases, the position of the acid/base residue is quite variable. Although several site-directed mutation studies have previously been performed on bacterial fucosidases, the only eukaryotic fucosidase so studied was the human fucosidase. Recent alignments indicate that human and Arthropoda alpha-l-fucosidases share at least 50% identity and the acid/base residue seems to be conserved among them suggesting a common acid/base residue in Metazoa. Here we describe the cloning and expression in Pichia pastoris of a very active alpha-l-fucosidase from the spider Nephilingis cruentata (NcFuc) with a Km value for pNPFuc of 0.4 mM. NcFuc hydrolyzed fucoidan, 2 fucosyllactose and also lacto-N-difucohexaose II. Mutants modified at the conserved residues D214N, E209A, E59A were expressed and characterized. The 500-fold lower kcat of D214N than the wild type was consistent with a role in catalysis, as was the 8000-fold lower kcat value of E59A. This was supported by the 57-fold increase in the kcat of E59A upon addition of azide. A complex pH/rate profile was seen for the wild-type and mutant forms of NcFuc, similar to those measured previously for the Sulfolobus fucosidase.

(+)-Ambrein is a major component of ambergris, an intestinal excretion of sperm whales that is found only serendipitously. Thus, the demand for (-)-ambrox is currently mainly met by chemical synthesis. A recent study described for the first time the applicability of an enzyme cascade consisting of two terpene cyclases, namely squalene-hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AaSHC D377C) and tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene cyclase from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTC) for in vitro (+)-ambrein production starting from squalene. Yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris, are natural producers of squalene and have already been shown in the past to be excellent hosts for the biosynthesis of hydrophobic compounds such as terpenoids. By targeting a central enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, squalene epoxidase Erg1, intracellular squalene levels in P. pastoris could be strongly enhanced. Heterologous expression of AaSHC D377C and BmeTC and, particularly, development of suitable methods to analyze all products of the engineered strain provided conclusive evidence of whole-cell (+)-ambrein production. Engineering of BmeTC led to a remarkable one-enzyme system that was by far superior to the cascade, thereby increasing (+)-ambrein levels approximately 7-fold in shake flask cultivation. Finally, upscaling to 5L bioreactor yielded more than 100mgL(-1) of (+)-ambrein, demonstrating that metabolically engineered yeast P. pastoris represents a valuable, whole-cell system for high-level production of (+)-ambrein.</p></details></div>

Available model analysis applied to this dual-limited condition is scarce and normally does not consider the interaction effects between the substrates. In this work, a dual-limited growth model of P. pastoris considering an interactive kinetic effect was applied to an optimised fed-batch process production of heterologous Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL). In the proposed model, the growth kinetics on glycerol is fully expressed, whereas methanol kinetics is modulated by the co-metabolisation of glycerol, resulting in an enhancing effect of glycerol-specific growth rate. The modelling approach of fed-batch cultures also included the methanol volatilisation caused by the aeration that was found to be a not-negligible phenomenon. The model predicts the ability of P. pastoris to keep control of the methanol concentration in the broth during ROL-optimised production process in fed batch and fits satisfactorily the specific cell growth rate and ROL production. Implications of interaction effect are discussed applying the general procedure of modelling approach.</p></details></div>

However, biosafety of CDs is still understudied, and there is not a generally accepted standard to evaluate the toxicity of CDs. We present a gradient network generator microfluidic device for dose-dependent testing of toxicity of CDs to a unicellular eukaryotic model organism, yeast Pichia pastoris. We fully characterized the microfluidic model and compare its performance with a conventional method. The gradient generator increased the contact area between the mixing species and enabled a high-throughput testing of CDs in a wide range of concentrations in cell chambers. Real time monitoring of yeast cell proliferation in the presence of CDs showed dose-dependent growth inhibition and various budding cell shape profiles. Comparing the result of microfluidic platform and conventional method revealed statistically significant differences in the proliferation rate of the cells between the two platforms. To understand the toxicity mechanism, we studied binding of CDs to P. pastoris and found increasing interactions of CDs with the cell surface at CDs larger concentrations. This study demonstrated the utility of the gradient generator microfluidic device as a convenient tool for toxicity assessment of nanomaterials at a cellular level.</p></details></div>

However, neither the alpha-galactosidase encoding gene in coconut nor the mutation type has been identified and characterized in normal and curd coconuts. In this study, cDNA and genomic DNA encoding alpha-galactosidase gene alleles from a normal and two curd coconuts were successfully cloned and characterized. The deduced amino acid of wild type alpha-galactosidase contains 398 amino acid residues with a 17N-terminal amino acids signal peptide sequence. Three mutant alleles, the first 19-amino acids from 67 to 85 (ADALVSTGLARLGYQYVNL) deletion with S137R and the second R216T, were identified from curd coconut plant no.1 while the third P250R was identified from curd coconut plant no. 10. All mutations of alpha-galactosidase gene were confirmed by the analysis of parental genomic DNA from normal and curd coconuts. Heterologous expression in Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) indicated that recombinant P250R, R216T and 19-amino acids deletion-S137R mutant proteins showed no alpha-galactosidase activity. Only the recombinant wild-type protein was able to detect for alpha-galactosidase activity. These results are in accordance with the no detection of alpha-galactosidase activity in developing curd coconut endosperms by tissue staining. While, the accumulation of enzyme activity was present in the solid endosperm of normal coconut. The full-length cDNA and parental genomic DNA sequences encoding alpha-galactosidase in normal coconut as well as identified curd coconut mutant alleles are reported in Genbank accession no. KJ957156 and KM001681-3. Transcription level of the alpha-galactosidase gene in mature curd coconut endosperm was at least 20 times higher than normal. In conclusion, absence of alpha-galactosidase activity caused by gene mutations associates with an accumulation of oligogalactomannan in endosperms, resulting in curd coconut phenotype.</p></details></div>

In all 78 copies of major vault protein (MVP) assemble on polyribosome templates, forming recombinant vault particles, which are of great interest as encapsulation carriers for therapeutics delivery and enzyme stabilization. Baculovirus-insect cell expression is the only system that has been developed for recombinant vault synthesis, but it has low scalability and slow production rate. In this study, we demonstrated the first use of yeast cells for the production of vault particles with full integrity and functionality solely by expressing the complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding MVP. Vaults synthesized in Pichia pastoris yeast cells are morphologically indistinguishable from recombinant vault particles produced in insect cells, and are able to package and stabilize enzymes resulting in improved longevity and catalytic efficiency. Thus, our results imply that the yeast system is an economical alternative to insect cells for the production of recombinant vaults. The consistency of vault morphology between yeast and insect cell systems also underlines that polyribosome templating may be conserved among eukaryotes, which promises the synthesis and assembly of recombinant human vault particles in other eukaryotic organisms.</p></details></div>

Recombinant plasmids with one, two and four cassettes of the MIP gene have been successfully constructed in the pPICZalphaA expression vector to study the effects of gene copy number on MIP production. The MIP protein can be detected by dot-blot analysis from the culture broth of P. pastoris KM71H 24h after placement in MMH induction medium. The secretion levels of MIP protein in culture broth at 72h after induction indicated that P. pastoris KM71H with one cassette of the MIP gene had highest MIP protein levels (4.19+/-0.96mgL(-1)). The transcription levels of the MIP gene increased proportionately with copy number. However, the amount of secreted MIP protein showed no correlation. The MIP molecular mass was 5756.951Da, as confirmed by typical MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MIP protein in culture broth was purified by two steps purification including SP Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography followed by ultrafiltration (10kDaMW cutoff). The percentage of MIP recovery after the two-step purification was 70%, with a single band in a native-PAGE. The biological activity of tryptic hydrolyzed MIP was determined via the expression of the glucose transporter 4 gene (GLUT4) in H9c2 (2-1) cell line by RT-qPCR, and the results demonstrated that the MIP protein can induce glucose uptake and upregulation of GLUT4 mRNA transcription at 3h and that this activity was related to Humalog((R)) insulin.</p></details></div>

Given that their administration is relatively easy and stress-free, oral vaccines have both economic and animal welfare benefits. Yet, mostly due to their limited efficacy, only very few oral vaccines are available to aquaculture industry. Here we present a method for oral vaccine delivery based on the yeast Pichia pastoris. We could express a model antigen, green fluorescent protein (GFP), in this yeast and subsequently show delivery of the GFP protein to the intestine of juvenile flounder or adult carp and trout. We tested this approach in several commercially-relevant fish species, from juvenile to adult stage. To test the oral delivery of antigen to larval fish, the GFP-expressing Pichia pastoris was first fed to planktonic crustacean Daphnia or rotifers that served as 'bioencapsulation vehicles' and afterwards, fed to flounder larvae. Again, we could show delivery of intact GFP protein to the intestine. In rainbow trout, the orally-administered GFP-expressing yeast elicited a rapid local innate immune response in the intestine and a subsequent systemic response in the spleen. Our results show that Pichia pastoris is a good vehicle for oral antigen delivery and that it can be used in non-encapsulated form for older fish or in bioencapsulated form for larval fish. We discuss the immunomodulatory properties of the yeast itself, and its potential to enhance local immune responses and act as an adjuvant.</p></details></div>

BAF180 is the chromatin-targeting subunit of the PBAF complex. BAF180 has six bromodomains, two BAH domains, and one HMG box. Bromodomains are known to recognize acetylated-lysines on histones and play a role in nucleosome recognition. BAH domains are required for ubiquitination of PCNA, a key regulator of DNA damage. The putative HMG box, if functional, may be involved in DNA-binding. While the binding specificities of individual bromodomains have been studied by our lab and others, the results have failed to reach a consensus. The acetyl-histone binding features of the full-length protein is unknown and is the motivation for this work. The hypothetical HMG and BAH domains have not been studied and the actual function of these regions is currently unknown. Thus, the precise interactions of this large and complex protein are not well-studied. Advances in understanding this large protein have been hindered by the inability to express and purify recombinant full-length BAF180 protein. Currently, only phenomenological studies using BAF180 expressed in mammalian cells have been conducted. Here, we report the successful expression, purification of full-length biologically active BAF180 protein using the GAP promoter in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris. The ability to express full-length and mutated BAF180 will allow for biophysical binding studies. Knowledge of the binding interactions is critical for us to understand the role of BAF180 in cancer development and its progression.</p></details></div>

Both EpXYN1 and EpXYN3 were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant enzymes were characterized using beechwood xylan, birchwood xylan, or oat spelt xylan as substrates, respectively. The optimum temperatures and pH values were 75 degrees C and 5.5 for EpXYN1, and 55 degrees C and 5.0 for EpXYN3. EpXYN1 exhibited a high stability at high temperature (65 degrees C) or at pH values from 8 to 10. EpXYN3 kept over 80% enzymatic activity after treatment at pH values from 3 to 10. The specific activities of EpXYN1 and EpXYN3 were 384.42 and 214.20 U/mg using beechwood xylan as substrate, respectively. EpXYN1 showed lower Km values and higher specific activities toward different xylans compared to EpXYN3. Thin-layer chromatography analysis indicated that the hydrolysis profiles of xylans or xylo-oligosacharides were different by EpXYN1and EpXYN3. EpXYN3 had a higher efficiency than EpXYN1 in production of feruloylated oligosaccharides (FOs) from de-starched wheat bran. The maximum levels of FOs released by EpXYN1 and EpXYN3 were 11.1 and 14.4 mumol/g, respectively.

Herein, we aimed to characterize the three main secreted CPs (CP14019, CP16160 and CP16779), which were identified by mass spectrometry in the medium during interaction with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro. First, the CPs were epitope-tagged and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures. Second, we showed that recombinant CPs, expressed in Pichia pastoris, are more active in acidic environment (pH 5.5-6) and we determined the kinetic parameters using fluorogenic substrates. Third, excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) from Giardia trophozoites affect the localization of apical junctional complex (AJC) proteins and recombinant CPs cleave or re-localize the AJC proteins (claudin-1 and -4, occludin, JAM-1, beta-catenin and E-cadherin) of IECs. Finally, we showed that the ESPs and recombinant CPs can degrade several chemokines, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, IL-8, CCL2, and CCL20, which are up-regulated in IECs during Giardia-host cell interactions. This is the first study that characterizes the role of specific CPs secreted from Giardia and our results collectively indicate their roles in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and modulating immune responses during Giardia infections.</p></details></div>
