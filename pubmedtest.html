Habrylo et al., Int J Biol Macromol   (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382578>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pectinases represent about one fifth of the enzyme worldwide market due their wide range of biotechnological applications. Current commercial pectinases are exclusively obtained from microbial sources, but here we report a pectin methylesterase (Sl-PME) and an endo-polygalacturonase (Sl-EPG) bioprospected from the sugarcane weevil, Sphenophorus levis, which revealed good potential for industrial applications. Sl-PME and Sl-EPG were overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and enzymatically characterized. Sl-EPG presents optimal activity at pH4-5 and 50 degrees C, showing that it can be used for juice extraction and clarification. On the other hand, Sl-PME presents optimal activity at pH6-8 and 40 degrees C, and thus, suitable for both acidic and alkaline processing, such as coffee and tea fermentation. Sl-EPG shows Vmax=3.23mM/min, KM=2.4g/L and kcat=418.6s(-1). While Sl-PME shows Vmax=0.14mM/min, KM=4.1g/L and kcat=1.7s(-1). A PG inhibitor (PGIP2) weakly interfered in the Sl-EPG activity and Sl-PME was not affected by a usual PME inhibitor. Moreover, these enzymes manifested synergistic action towards methylesterified pectin. Here, we propose these enzymes as novel alternative tools for the current commercial pectinases.</p></details><hr><h4>[Synthesis of vitamin K2 by isopentenyl transferase NovA in Pichia pastoris Gpn12].</h4><p>X.

The expression of NovQ increased by 36% when 2% methanol was added every 24 h. The influence of initial pH, temperature, methanol addition, precursors (menadione, isopentenol) addition, catalytic time and cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) addition were explored in the P. pastoris whole-cell catalytic synthesis process of MK-3 in shaking flask. Three significant factors were then studied by response surface method. The optimal catalytic conditions obtained were as follows: catalytic temperature 31.56 , menadione 295.54 mg/L, catalytic time 15.87 h. Consistent with the response surface prediction results, the optimized yield of MK-3 reached 98.47 mg/L in shaking flask, 35% higher than that of the control group. On this basis, the production in a 30-L fermenter reached 189.67 mg/L when the cell catalyst of 220 g/L (dry weight) was used to catalyze the synthesis for 24 h. This method laid the foundation for the large-scale production of MK-3 by P. pastoris Gpn12.</p></details><hr><h4>[A highly active GH11 xylanase from Penicillium sp.

In order to obtain low temperature active xylanase, a xylanase gene, XYN11A, was cloned from Penicillium sp. L1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. After purification and enzyme assay, optimal pH and temperature were determined to be 3.5 to 4.0 and 55 . This enzyme was stable at acid and neutral condition (pH 1.0 to 7.0) or under the treatment of 40 for 1 hour. This xylanase displayed strong resistance to all tested ions and chemicals. Noteworthily, XYN11A maintained a higher activity of 6 700 U/mg than a lot of GH11 xylanase, and demonstrated higher activity (24% to 58%) at lower temperature from 20 to 40 . After beechwood xylan hydrolysis for 16 h, the hydrolysates consisted mainly of xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose and barely of xylose, thus XYN11A could be used for the production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharide. Possessing the features of acidophilic, highly active at lower temperature and oligosaccharide production, XYN11A demonstrated great potential in food and feed industrials.</p></details><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris-Expressed Bivalent Virus-Like Particulate Vaccine Induces Domain III-Focused Bivalent Neutralizing Antibodies without Antibody-Dependent Enhancement in Vivo.</h4><p>R.

Antibodies to any one DENV serotype which can protect against homotypic re-infection, do not offer heterotypic cross-protection. In fact, cross-reactive antibodies may augment heterotypic DENV infection through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). A recently launched live attenuated vaccine (LAV) for dengue, which consists of a mixture of four chimeric yellow-fever/dengue vaccine viruses, may be linked to the induction of disease-enhancing antibodies. This is likely related to viral interference among the replicating viral strains, resulting in an unbalanced immune response, as well as to the fact that the LAV encodes prM, a DENV protein documented to elicit ADE-mediating antibodies. This makes it imperative to explore the feasibility of alternate ADE risk-free vaccine candidates. Our quest for a non-replicating vaccine centered on the DENV envelope (E) protein which mediates virus entry into the host cell and serves as an important target of the immune response. Serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes and the host receptor recognition function map to E domain III (EDIII). Recently, we found that Pichia pastoris-expressed DENV E protein, of all four serotypes, self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of prM. Significantly, these VLPs displayed EDIII and elicited EDIII-focused DENV-neutralizing antibodies in mice. We now report the creation and characterization of a novel non-replicating recombinant particulate vaccine candidate, produced by co-expressing the E proteins of DENV-1 and DENV-2 in P. pastoris. The two E proteins co-assembled into bivalent mosaic VLPs (mVLPs) designated as mE1E2bv VLPs. The mVLP, which preserved the serotype-specific antigenic integrity of its two component proteins, elicited predominantly EDIII-focused homotypic virus-neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice, demonstrating its efficacy. In an in vivo ADE model, mE1E2bv VLP-induced antibodies lacked discernible ADE potential, compared to the cross-reactive monoclonal antibody 4G2, as evidenced by significant reduction in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, suggesting inherent safety. The results obtained with these bivalent mVLPs suggest the feasibility of incorporating the E proteins of DENV-3 and DENV-4 to create a tetravalent mVLP vaccine.</p></details><hr><h4>Yeast-based synthetic biology platform for antimicrobial peptide production.</h4><p>J. Cao et al., ACS Synth Biol   (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29366323>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Antibiotic resistance represents one of the most challenging global health threats in our society. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. However, they are limited by their high manufacturing cost. Engineering living organisms represents a promising approach to produce such molecules in an inexpensive manner. Here, we genetically modified the yeast Pichia pastoris to produce the prototypical AMP apidaecin Ia using a fusion protein approach that leverages the beneficial properties (e.g., stability) of human serum albumin. The peptide was successfully isolated from the fusion protein construct, purified, and demonstrated to have bioactivity against Escherichia coli. To demonstrate this approach as a manufacturing solution to AMPs, we scaled-up production in bioreactors to generate high AMP yields. We envision that this system could lead to improved AMP biomanufacturing platforms.</p></details><hr><h4>Controlling AOX1 promoter strength in Pichia pastoris by manipulating poly (dA:dT) tracts.</h4><p>J.

In recent years, AOX1 promoter libraries have been developed with deletion or insertion methods. The present research manipulated poly (d</p><p><strong>A:</strong>dT) tracts in this promoter to control promoter strength, which hadn't been tried before. There were 34 variants derived from the native AOX1 promoter constructed. And variants were integrated into the same genomic location and upstream of the same reporter gene porcine growth hormone (pGH). To test the transferability of the results obtained from reporter gene pGH, the variants were connected to reporter gene Lac Z. The resulted promoter library spanned an activity range between 0.25 and 3.5 fold of the wild-type promoter activity. In addition, activities of variants correlated with their predicted nucleosome architecture, which were directed by poly (d</p><p><strong>A:</strong>dT) tracts. The cumulative sum of predicted nucleosome affinity across the region (-820 to -540) was related to promoters strength in single deletion variants on a proportional basis. Overall, the research promotes understanding of the regulatory patterns for AOX1 promoter and suggested that varying promoter expression of engineering nucleosome architecture was also a feasible approach in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Perdeuteration of cholesterol for neutron scattering applications using recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M. Moulin et al., Chem Phys Lipids   (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357283>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Deuteration of biomolecules has a great impact on both quality and scope of neutron scattering experiments. Cholesterol is a major component of mammalian cells, where it plays a critical role in membrane permeability, rigidity and dynamics, and contributes to specific membrane structures such as lipid rafts. Cholesterol is the main cargo in low and high-density lipoprotein complexes (i.e. LDL, HDL) and is directly implicated in several pathogenic conditions such as coronary artery disease which leads to 17 million deaths annually. Neutron scattering studies on membranes or lipid-protein complexes exploiting contrast variation have been limited by the lack of availability of fully deuterated biomolecules and especially perdeuterated cholesterol. The availability of perdeuterated cholesterol provides a unique way of probing the structural and dynamical properties of the lipoprotein complexes that underly many of these disease conditions. Here we describe a procedure for in vivo production of perdeuterated recombinant cholesterol in lipid-engineered Pichia pastoris. Using flask and fed-batch fermenter cultures in deuterated minimal medium perdeuteration of the purified cholesterol was verified by mass spectrometry and its use in a neutron scattering study was demonstrated using neutron reflectometry.</p></details><hr><h4>Prime-boost vaccination with recombinant protein and adenovirus-vector expressing Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein (CSP) partially protects mice against Pb/Pv sporozoite challenge.</h4><p>T.

To narrow this gap, we administered recombinant antigens based on P. vivax circumsporozoite protein (CSP) to mice. We expressed in Pichia pastoris two chimeric proteins by merging the three central repeat regions of different CSP alleles (VK210, VK247, and P. vivax-like). The first construct (yPvCSP-AllFL) contained the fused repeat regions flanked by N- and C-terminal regions. The second construct (yPvCSP-AllCT) contained the fused repeat regions and the C-terminal domain, plus RI region. Mice were vaccinated with three doses of yPvCSP in adjuvants Poly (</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C) or Montanide ISA720. We also used replication-defective adenovirus vectors expressing CSP of human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee serotype 68 (AdC68) for priming mice which were subsequently boosted twice with yPvCSP proteins in Poly (</p><p><strong>I:</strong>C) adjuvant. Regardless of the regime used, immunized mice generated high IgG titres specific to all CSP alleles. After challenge with P. berghei ANKA transgenic parasites expressing Pb/PvVK210 or Pb/PvVK247 sporozoites, significant time delays for parasitemia were observed in all vaccinated mice. These vaccine formulations should be clinically tried for their potential as protective universal vaccine against P. vivax malaria.</p></details><hr><h4>Structure and function of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase from Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>M.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of cytoplasmic SHMT from Pichia pastoris (pcSHMT) diffracted to 2.5A resolution in space group C2221. PcSHMT was a contaminant with our target protein expressed in Pichia pastoris and confirmed by mass spectrometry. The overall structure of pcSHMT is similar to Human mitochondrial SHMT and different to E. coli SHMT. Interestingly, the oligomerization of pcSHMT expressed in eukaryotic or prokaryotic system differs significantly and is regulated by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. Our results revealed a close evolutionary relationship between Pichia pastoris and Human mitochondria.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression, activation and processing of a novel plant milk-clotting aspartic protease in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L.

We used RACE PCR to isolate novel enzymes from Galium verum with the ability to clot milk. This approach generated two cDNA sequences (named preprogaline A and B) encoding proteins displaying the typical plant aspartic protease primary structure. Preprogaline B was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, after deleting and replacing its original signal peptide with the yeast alpha-factor signal peptide from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The secreted recombinant protein was obtained by growing P. pastoris in YPD medium and had the ability to clot milk. The mature form of progaline B is a heterodimeric glycosylated enzyme, with a molecular weight of approximately 48kDa, that contains a heavy (30.7kDa) and a light (13.5kDa) polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds. Western blot analysis revealed that progaline B is activated by the acidification of the yeast culture medium and that enzymatic activation requires two steps. First the precursor protein is cleaved into two polypeptide chains by partial removal of the plant-specific insert (PSI) present in plant aspartic proteases; this is later followed by propeptide removal. By altering the pH of the P. pastoris culture medium, we were able to obtain either active or inactive forms of the enzyme. Recombinant progaline B displayed a kappa-casein hydrolysis pattern analogous to those produced by the animal and microbial coagulants currently used in the dairy industry, but it exhibited a different digestion profile on alpha- and beta-caseins. The plant protease progaline B displays milk-clotting activities suitable for the production of novel dairy products.</p></details><hr><h4>Molecular characterization and function of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda.</h4><p>Y.

In this paper, the full-length cDNA sequence encoding NAGase (EcNAG) was obtained from Exopalaemon carinicauda. The deduced amino acid sequence of EcNAG open reading frame (ORF) contained one Glycohydro_20b2 domain and one Glyco_hydro_20 domain. Based on the cDNA sequence, the genomic structure of EcNAG was characterized and it was composed of six exons and five introns. EcNAG mRNA majorly expressed in the hepatopancreas and epidermis. During the molting stages, EcNAG mRNA expression was well-regulated and its expression reached the highest level at the molting stage E. In addition, EcNAG was recombinant expressed in Pichia pastoris and the partial enzymatic characterization of recombinant EcNAG was confirmed. After being challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila, the expression of EcNAG was up-regulated significantly at 6h and reached the peak at 12h. And then, the expression began to down-regulated and came to the normal level at 72h. It is helpful to research the relationship between the molt-related hormones and chitinlytic enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Implementing CRISPR-Cas technologies in conventional and non-conventional yeasts: Current state and future prospects.</h4><p>H.

Especially in S. cerevisiae, an extensive toolbox of advanced CRISPR-related applications has been established, including crisprTFs and gene drives.

Vogl, L. Gebbie, R. W. Palfreyman, R. Speight, Appl Environ Microbiol   (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330186>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii) is one of the most common eukaryotic expression systems for heterologous protein production. Expression cassettes are typically integrated in the genome to obtain stable expression strains. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where short overhangs are sufficient to target highly specific integration, long overhangs are more efficient in P. pastoris and ectopic integration of foreign DNA can occur. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of ectopic integration by high throughput screening of >700 transformants and whole genome sequencing of 27 transformants. Different vector designs and linearization approaches were used to mimic the most common integration events targeted in P. pastoris Fluorescence of an eGFP reporter protein was highly uniform amongst transformants when the expression cassettes were correctly integrated in the targeted locus. Surprisingly, most non-specifically integrated transformants showed highly uniform expression that was comparable to specific integration, suggesting that non-specific integration does not necessarily influence expression. However, a few clones (<10%) harboring ectopically integrated cassettes showed a greater variation spanning a 25-fold range, surpassing specifically integrated reference strains up to 6-fold. High expression strains showed a correlation between increased gene copy numbers and high reporter protein fluorescence levels. Our results suggest that for comparing expression levels between strains, the integration locus can be neglected as long as a sufficient numbers of transformed strains are compared. For expression optimization of highly expressible proteins, increasing copy number appears to be the dominant positive influence rather than the integration locus, genomic rearrangements, deletions or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).ImportanceYeasts are commonly used as biotechnological production hosts for proteins and metabolites. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression cassettes carrying foreign genes integrate highly specifically at the targeted sites in the genome. In contrast, cassettes often integrate at random genomic positions in non-conventional yeasts such as Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). Hence cells from the same transformation event often behave differently with significant clonal variation necessitating the screening of large numbers of strains. The importance of this study is that we systematically investigated the influence of integration events in over 700 strains. Our findings provide novel insight into clonal variation in P. pastoris, and thus how to avoid pitfalls and obtain reliable results. The underlying mechanisms may also play a role in other yeasts and hence could be generally relevant for recombinant yeast protein production strains.</p></details><hr><h4>Preparation of gentiooligosaccharides using Trichoderma viride beta-glucosidase.</h4><p>F.

The enzyme activity of beta-glucosidase reached 1402U/ml following optimisation of fermentation conditions in a 3.6l bioreactor. With 80% glucose as substrate, gentiooligosaccharides were synthesised by beta-glucosidase-based reverse hydrolysis. A yield of 130g/l was achieved with a conversion rate of 16.25%. With 20% glucose and 40% cellobiose as substrates, gentiooligosaccharides were synthesised by transglycosylation with a yield of 116g/l and a conversion rate of 19.4%.</p></details><hr><h4>Stabilizing Leaf and Branch Compost Cutinase (LCC) with Glycosylation: Mechanism and Effect on PET Hydrolysis.</h4><p>A. N. Shirke et al., Biochemistry   (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328676>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Cutinases are polyester hydrolases that show a remarkable capability to hydrolyze polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to its monomeric units. This revelation has stimulated research aimed at developing sustainable and green cutinase-catalyzed PET recycling methods. Leaf and branch compost cutinase (LCC) is particularly suited toward these ends given its relatively high PET hydrolysis activity and thermostability. Any practical enzymatic PET recycling application will require that the protein have kinetic stability at or above the PET glass transition temperature (Tg, i.e., 70 degrees C). This paper elucidates the thermodynamics and kinetics of LCC conformational and colloidal stability. Aggregation emerged as a major contributor that reduces LCC kinetic stability. In its native state, LCC is prone to aggregation owing to electrostatic interactions. Further, with increasing temperature, perturbation of LCC's tertiary structure and corresponding exposure of hydrophobic domains leads to rapid aggregation. Glycosylation was employed in an attempt to impede LCC aggregation. Owing to the presence of three putative N-glycosylation sites, expression of native LCC in Pichia pastoris resulted in the production of glycosylated LCC (LCC-G). LCC-G showed improved stability to native state aggregation while increasing the temperature for thermal induced aggregation by 10 degrees C. Furthermore, stabilization against thermal aggregation resulted in improved catalytic PET hydrolysis both at its optimum temperature and concentration.</p></details><hr><h4>Enterovirus D68 virus-like particles expressed in Pichia pastoris potently induce neutralizing antibody responses and confer protection against lethal viral infection in mice.</h4><p>C.

However, no vaccine is currently available to prevent EV-D68 infection. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of developing a virus-like particle (VLP)-based EV-D68 vaccine. We found that co-expression of the P1 precursor and 3CD protease of EV-D68 in Pichia pastoris yeast resulted in the generation of EV-D68 VLPs, which were composed of processed VP0, VP1, and VP3 capsid proteins and were visualized as ~30 nm spherical particles. Mice immunized with these VLPs produced serum antibodies capable of specifically neutralizing EV-D68 infections in vitro. The in vivo protective efficacy of the EV-D68 VLP candidate vaccine was assessed in two challenge experiments. The first challenge experiment showed that neonatal mice born to the VLP-immunized dams were fully protected from lethal EV-D68 infection, whereas in the second experiment, passive transfer of anti-VLP sera was found to confer complete protection in the recipient mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate the proof-of-concept for VLP-based broadly effective EV-D68 vaccines.</p></details><hr><h4>Design, expression, and characterization of the hybrid antimicrobial peptide T-catesbeianin-1 based on FyuA.</h4><p>H.

At present, antimicrobial peptides have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers. However, antimicrobial peptides often affect a broad range of microorganisms, including the normal flora in a host organism. In the present study, we designed a novel hybrid antimicrobial peptide, expressed the hybrid peptide, and studied its specific target. The hybrid peptide, named T-catesbeianin-1, which includes the FyuA-binding domain of pesticin and the peptide catesbeianin-1, was designed and expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. Then, we determined the antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and specific target of the peptide. T-catesbeianin-1 has strong antimicrobial activity and binds to FyuA to inhibit or kill Escherichia coli present in clinical specimens and mixed-species culture. In summary, these findings suggested that T-catesbeianin-1 might be promising and specific antibiotic agent for therapeutic application against fyuA(+) E. coli.</p></details><hr><h4>Metabolic engineering of Pichia pastoris for production of isobutanol and isobutyl acetate.</h4><p>W. Siripong et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 11 1 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321810>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Background: Interests in renewable fuels have exploded in recent years as the serious effects of global climate change become apparent. Microbial production of high-energy fuels by economically efficient bioprocesses has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional production of transportation fuels. Here, we engineered Pichia pastoris, an industrial workhorse in heterologous enzyme production, to produce the biofuel isobutanol from two renewable carbon sources, glucose and glycerol. Our strategy exploited the yeast's amino acid biosynthetic pathway and diverted the amino acid intermediates to the 2-keto acid degradation pathway for higher alcohol production. To further demonstrate the versatility of our yeast platform, we incorporated a broad-substrate-range alcohol-O-acyltransferase to generate a variety of volatile esters, including isobutyl acetate ester and isopentyl acetate ester. Results: The engineered strain overexpressing the keto-acid degradation pathway was able to produce 284 mg/L of isobutanol when supplemented with 2-ketoisovalerate. To improve the production of isobutanol and eliminate the need to supplement the production media with the expensive 2-ketoisovalerate intermediate, we overexpressed a portion of the amino acid l-valine biosynthetic pathway in the engineered strain. While heterologous expression of the pathway genes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not lead to improvement in isobutanol production in the engineered P. pastoris, overexpression of the endogenous l-valine biosynthetic pathway genes led to a strain that is able to produce 0.89 g/L of isobutanol. Fine-tuning the expression of bottleneck enzymes by employing an episomal plasmid-based expression system further improved the production titer of isobutanol to 2.22 g/L, a 43-fold improvement from the levels observed in the original strain. Finally, heterologous expression of a broad-substrate-range alcohol-O-acyltransferase led to the production of isobutyl acetate ester and isopentyl acetate ester at 51 and 24 mg/L, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, we engineered high-level production of the biofuel isobutanol and the corresponding acetate ester by P. pastoris from readily available carbon sources. We envision that our work will provide an economic route to this important class of compounds and establish P. pastoris as a versatile production platform for fuels and chemicals.</p></details><hr><h4>Cell-Surface Displayed Expression of Trehalose Synthase from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 47054 in Pichia Pastoris Using Pir1p as an Anchor Protein.</h4><p>S.

In this study, a treS gene was fused with the yeast cell-surface anchor protein gene Pir1p by overlap PCR, the Pir1p-treS fusion gene was ligated into pPICZalphaA and pGAPZalphaA and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 to obtain recombinant yeast strains that displays trehalose synthase(TreS) on its cell surface as an efficient and recyclable whole-cell biocatalyst. Firstly, the enhanced green fluorescence protein gene (egfp) was used as the reporter protein to fusion the Pir1p gene and treS gene to construct the recombinant plasmids containing treS-egfg-Pir1p fusion gene, and electrotransformed into P. pastoris GS115 to analyze the surface display characteristics of fusion gene by Western blot, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The analysis shown that the treS-egfg-Pir1p fusion protein can be successfully displayed on the surface of yeast cell, and the expression level increased with the extension of fermentation time. These results implied that the Pir1p-treS fusion gene can be well displayed on the cell surface. Secondly, in order to obtain surface active cells with high enzyme activity, the enzymatic properties of TreS displayed on the cell surface was analyzed, and the fermentation process of recombinant P. patoris GS115 containing pPICZalphaA-Pir1p-treS and pGAPZalphaA-Pir1p-treS was studied respectively. The cell surface display TreS was stable over a broad range of temperatures (10-45 degrees C) and pH (6.0-8.5). The activity of TreS displayed on cell surface respectively reached 1,108 Ug(-1) under PAOX1 control for 150 h, and 1,109 Ug(-1) under PGAP control for 75h in a 5 L fermenter, respectively. Lastly, the cell-surface displayed TreS was used to product trehalose using high maltose syrup as substrate at pH 8.0 and 15 degrees C. The surface display TreS cells can be recycled for three times and the weight conversion rate of trehalose was more than 60%. This paper revealed that the TreS can display on the P. pastoris cell surface and still had a higher catalytic activity after recycled three times, which was suitable for industrial application, especially the preparation of pharmaceutical grade trehalose products.</p></details><hr><h4>Glycoengineering of antibody (Herceptin) through yeast expression and in vitro enzymatic glycosylation.</h4><p>C. P. Liu et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 115 720 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29311294>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed as therapeutics, especially for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases. Because the glycosylation of mAbs in the Fc region influences their interaction with effector cells that kill antibody-targeted cells, and the current method of antibody production is relatively expensive, efforts have been directed toward the development of alternative expressing systems capable of large-scale production of mAbs with desirable glycoforms. In this study, we demonstrate that the mAb trastuzumab expressed in glycoengineered P. pastoris can be remodeled through deglycosylation by endoglycosidases identified from the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database and through transglycosylation using glycans with a stable leaving group to generate a homogeneous antibody designed to optimize the effector functions. The 10 newly identified recombinant bacterial endoglycosidases are complementary to existing endoglycosidases (EndoA, EndoH, EndoS), two of which can even accept sialylated tri- and tetraantennary glycans as substrates.</p></details><hr><h4>Kinetic resolution of sec-alcohols catalysed by Candida antarctica lipase B displaying Pichia pastoris whole-cell biocatalyst.</h4><p>K.

Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) displayed on Pichia pastoris cell-surface (Pp-CALB) was characterized in kinetic resolution of sec-alcohols with different structures. The reaction parameters including acyl donors, molar ratio of substrates, solvents and temperatures were examined with 2-octanol as model substrate. 47.4% molar conversion of 2-octanol and 99.7% eep were obtained after a 5h reaction with Pp-CALB, and 90% of its original activity still remained after being reused for 10 cycles. Pp-CALB was then used to several sec-alcohols and it showed great enzymatic activity and enantioselectivity to all tested sec-alcohols, more than 93.1% of eep. The enantioselective characteristics of Pp-CALB catalysed sec-alcohols with different structures were compared with Novozyme 435 which was almost the same. Solvent free system as one way of green chemistry was applied to Pp-CALB and Pp-CALB showed great catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. Pp-CALB was potential biocatalyst of high enzymatic activity and enantioselectivity using in resolution of sec-alcohols.</p></details><hr><h4>A tetravalent virus-like particle vaccine designed to display domain III of dengue envelope proteins induces multi-serotype neutralizing antibodies in mice and macaques which confer protection against antibody dependent enhancement in AG129 mice.</h4><p>V. Ramasamy et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 12 e0006191 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309412>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Dengue is one of the fastest spreading vector-borne diseases, caused by four antigenically distinct dengue viruses (DENVs). Antibodies against DENVs are responsible for both protection as well as pathogenesis. A vaccine that is safe for and efficacious in all people irrespective of their age and domicile is still an unmet need. It is becoming increasingly apparent that vaccine design must eliminate epitopes implicated in the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> We report a Pichia pastoris-expressed dengue immunogen, DSV4, based on DENV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), which contains well-characterized serotype-specific and cross-reactive epitopes. In natural infection, <10% of the total neutralizing antibody response is EDIII-directed. Yet, this is a functionally relevant domain which interacts with the host cell surface receptor. DSV4 was designed by in-frame fusion of EDIII of all four DENV serotypes and hepatitis B surface (S) antigen and co-expressed with unfused S antigen to form mosaic virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs displayed EDIIIs of all four DENV serotypes based on probing with a battery of serotype-specific anti-EDIII monoclonal antibodies. The DSV4 VLPs were highly immunogenic, inducing potent and durable neutralizing antibodies against all four DENV serotypes encompassing multiple genotypes, in mice and macaques. DSV4-induced murine antibodies suppressed viremia in AG129 mice and conferred protection against lethal DENV-4 virus challenge. Further, neither murine nor macaque anti-DSV4 antibodies promoted mortality or inflammatory cytokine production when passively transferred and tested in an in vivo dengue disease enhancement model of AG129 mice. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Directing the immune response to a non-immunodominant but functionally relevant serotype-specific dengue epitope of the four DENV serotypes, displayed on a VLP platform, can help minimize the risk of inducing disease-enhancing antibodies while eliciting effective tetravalent seroconversion. DSV4 has a significant potential to emerge as a safe, efficacious and inexpensive subunit dengue vaccine candidate.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of 16-kDa major allergen with alpha-amylase inhibitor domain in tartary buckwheat seeds.</h4><p>B.

Buckwheat contains highly potent allergens that trigger an allergic reaction via an IgE mediated response. In this work, the full-length cDNA encoding Fag t 2 from tartary buckwheat seeds was cloned by screening the cDNA library of seed-filling period. The recombinant Fag t 2 (rFag t 2) expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168H was purified by purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. It demonstrated that Fag t 2 was a major allergen in tartary buckwheat with the activity of IgE binding and pepsin resistance, along with the thermal stability. The identification of natural Fag t 2 (n Fag t 2) confirmed that the Fag t 2 protein belongs to the 2S albumin family, only existing in embryo. Most interesting, we discovered that Fag t 2 had a alpha-amylase inhibitor domain near the end of C-terminal. The possible activity of alpha-amylase inhibitor of Fag t 2 will be detected in subsequent studies.</p></details><hr><h4>Gene expression profiling provides insights into the immune mechanism of Plutella xylostella midgut to microbial infection.</h4><p>J. Lin et al., Gene   (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305978>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Insect gut immunity plays a key role in defense against microorganism infection. The knowledge of insect gut immunity has been obtained mostly from Drosophila melanogaster. Little is known about gut immunity in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a pest destroying cruciferous crops worldwide. In this study, expressions of the immune-related genes in the midgut of P. xylostella orally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris were profiled by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR approaches. The results revealed that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways and possibly the prophenoloxidase activation system in P. xylostella could be activated by oral infections, and moricins, gloverins and lysozyme2 might act as important effectors against microorganisms. Subsequent knock-down of IMD showed that this gene was involved in regulating the expression of down-stream genes in the IMD pathway. Our work indicates that the Toll, IMD, JNK and JAK-STAT pathways may synergistically modulate immune responses in the P. xylostella midgut, implying a complex and diverse immune system in the midgut of insects.</p></details><hr><h4>Trp residue at subsite - 5 plays a critical role in the substrate binding of two protistan GH26 beta-mannanases from a termite hindgut.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, two beta-mannanases, RsMan26A and RsMan26B, from a symbiotic protist community of the lower termite, Reticulitermes speratus, were successfully expressed in the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. Biochemical characterization experiments demonstrated that both RsMan26A and RsMan26B are endo-acting enzymes and have a very similar substrate specificity, displaying a higher catalytic efficiency to galactomannan from locust bean gum (LBG) and glucomannan than to beta-1,4-mannan and highly substituted galactomannan from guar gum. Homology modeling of RsMan26A and RsMan26B revealed that each enzyme displays a long open cleft harboring a unique hydrophobic platform (Trp(79)) that stacks against the sugar ring at subsite - 5. The Km values of W79A mutants of RsMan26A and RsMan26B to LBG increased by 4.8-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively, compared with those for the native enzymes, while the kcat remained unchanged or about 40% of that of the native enzyme, resulting in the decrease in the catalytic efficiency by 4.8-fold and 9.1-fold, respectively. The kinetic values for glucomannan also showed a similar result. These results demonstrate that the Trp residue present near the subsite - 5 has an important role in the recognition of the sugar ring in the substrate.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification of a clip domain serine proteinase involved in immune defense in Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis.</h4><p>Z.

In the present study, the full-length cDNA of a clip domain serine proteinase (designed as EsCDSP) gene was cloned from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. It was of 1488 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1134 bp encoding a polypeptide of 377 amino acids. There were a signal peptide, a clip domain, and a Tryp_SPc domain in the deduced amino acid sequence of EsCDSP. Highly conserved cysteine residues were identified in the clip domain and Tryp_SPc domain. EsCDSP shared similarities of 40%-61% with CDSPs from Penaeus monodon (ACP19562.1), Scylla paramamosain (CCW43200.1), Drosophila melanogaster (NP_649734.2) and Delia antiqua (AAW57295.1). It was clustered with other CDSPs from crabs in the phylogenetic tree. EsCDSP transcript was highly expressed in hemocytes and it could response to the stimulations of Vibro anguillarum and Pichia pastoris. rEsCDSP could activate proPO system and significantly increase the PO activity of HLS. In addition, rEsCDSP could bond to Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibro anguillarum and Vibro alginolyticus, and reduced the mortality rate causing by pathogen infection. All the results suggested that EsCDSP was an important immune response participator involved in activation of the proPO system of crab.</p></details><hr><h4>Pichia pastoris is a Suitable Host for the Heterologous Expression of Predicted Class I and Class II Hydrophobins for Discovery, Study, and Application in Biotechnology.</h4><p>J.

The functional assembly and aggregation of hydrophobins offers intriguing biotechnological applications from surface modification to drug delivery, yet make developing systems for their heterologous expression challenging. In this article, we describe the development of Pichia pastoris KM71H strains capable of solubly producing the full set of predicted Cordyceps militaris hydrophobins CMil1 (Class IA), CMil2 (Class II), and CMil3 (IM) at mg/L yields with the use of 6His-tags not only for purification but for their detection. This result further demonstrates the feasibility of using P. pastoris as a host organism for the production of hydrophobins from all Ascomycota Class I subdivisions (a classification our previous work defined) as well as Class II. We highlight the specific challenges related to the production of hydrophobins, notably the challenge in detecting the protein that will be described, in particular during the screening of transformants. Together with the literature, our results continue to show that P. pastoris is a suitable host for the soluble heterologous expression of hydrophobins with a wide range of properties.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel aspartic protease from Rhizomucor miehei expressed in Pichia pastoris and its application on meat tenderization and preparation of turtle peptides.</h4><p>Q.

The RmproA was successfully expressed in P. pastoris as an active extracellular protease. High protease activity of 3480.4U/mL was obtained by high cell-density fermentation. The protease was purified by the two step protocols to homogeneity. The molecular mass of the RmproA was estimated to be 52.4kDa by SDS-PAGE and 50.6kDa by gel filtration. The purified enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.5 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme exhibited a broad range of substrate specificity. RmproA-treated pork muscle showed lower shear force than papain-treated sample at a relative low concentration, suggesting its effectiveness on meat tenderization. Moreover, turtle hydrolysis by RmproA resulted in a large amount of small peptides, which exhibited high ACE-inhibitory activity. Thus, RmproA may be a potential candidate for several industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Methanol independent induction in Pichia pastoris by simple derepressed overexpression of single transcription factors.</h4><p>T.

Acquiring control over the natural regulation of promoters is important for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications. In the commonly used protein production host Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris), methanol-inducible promoters are used because of their tight regulation and exceptional strength. Yet, induction with toxic and flammable methanol can be a considerable safety risk and cannot be applied in many existing fermentation plants. Here we studied new regulatory circuits based on the most frequently used alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (PAOX1 ), which is tightly repressed in presence of repressing carbon sources and strongly induced by methanol. We compared different overexpression strategies for putative carbon source dependent regulators identified by a homology search in related yeasts and previously published literature in order to convert existing methanol dependent expression strains into methanol free systems. While constitutive overexpression showed only marginal or detrimental effects, derepressed expression (activated when the repressing carbon source is depleted) showed that three transcription factors (TFs) are single handedly suitable to strongly activate PAOX1 in P. pastoris without relying on any specifically engineered host strains. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated that Mxr1, Mit1, and Prm1 regulate partly overlapping and unique sets of genes. Derepressed overexpression of a single TF was sufficient to retrofit existing PAOX1 based expression strains into glucose/glycerol regulated, methanol-free systems. Given the wide applicability of carbon source regulated promoters, the simplicity and low cost of controlling carbon source feed rates in large scale bioreactors, similar approaches as in P. pastoris may also be useful in other organisms.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and purification of biologically active bovine Interferon lambda3 (IL28B) in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>S.

These Interferons induce signal transduction pathways similar to type I Interferons which results in the activation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This group of Interferons are tissue specific and reported to have antiviral activity. In the present communication, we report the expression of bovine IFNlambda3 gene (coding for the mature protein) in Pichia pastoris, purification of the expressed protein and evaluation of its biological activity. About 19kDa protein expressed by the transformed Pichia cells, secreted into the media and the protein was purified by SP-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography with NaCl stepwise gradient elution. Specificity of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Pichia expressed IFNlambda3 was found to be biologically active, as it induced ISGs (Mx protein, OAS and PKR genes) in bovine PBMCs. Further it was also found to modulate Th1/Th2 cytokines expression in the stimulated bovine PBMCs.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and characterization of novel promoters for recombinant protein production in yeast Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>N.

However, in order to realize the directed change or improve their properties, it is necessary to understand the basics of catalysis and the specificity of interactions with substrates. In the present work, a structural and functional study of the Fab fragment of antibody A5 and a comparative analysis of its properties with antibody A17 have been carried out. These antibodies were previously selected for their ability to interact with organophosphorus compounds via covalent catalysis. It has been established that antibody A5 has exceptional specificity for phosphonate X with bimolecular reaction rate constants of 510 +/- 20 and 390 +/- 20 min^(-1)capital EM, Cyrillic^(-1) for kappa and lambda variants, respectively. 3D-Modeling of antibody A5 structure made it possible to establish that the reaction residue L-Y33 is located on the surface of the active site, in contrast to the A17 antibody, in which the reaction residue L-Y37 is located at the bottom of a deep hydrophobic pocket. To investigate a detailed mechanism of the reaction, A5 antibody mutants with replacements L-R51W and H-F100W were created, which made it possible to perform stopped-flow kinetics. Tryptophan mutants were obtained as Fab fragments in the expression system of the methylotrophic yeast species Pichia pastoris. It has been established that the effectiveness of their interaction with phosphonate X is comparable to the wild-type antibody. Using the data of the stopped-flow kinetics method, significant conformational changes were established in the phosphonate modification process. The reaction was found to proceed using the induced-fit mechanism; the kinetic parameters of the elementary stages of the process have been calculated. The results present the prospects for the further improvement of antibody-based biocatalysts.</p></details><hr><h4>[Construction and high-density fermentation of alkaline pectate lyase high-yield yeast].</h4><p>X.

Compared to conventional processes that involve high alkaline and high temperature treatment, enzyme based treatments have significant advantages in fibers protectiveness, improved efficiency of refining, reduced energy consumption and pollution. Hence, it would be highly desirable to construct high-yield alkaline pectate lyase engineered strains and reduce the pectate lyase production cost. In the previous study, pectate lyase gene pel from Bacillus subtilis168 was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 after codon usage optimization based on the vector pHBM905A. To improve the expression level, the vector pHBM905BDM with optimized promoter and signal peptide was used to express the optimized gene pels in GS115. The transformant had increased activity from 68 U/mL to 100 U/mL with the improvement in the transcription level by 27% measured by qPCR. The transformants were further screened on pectin plates, where higher halo forming strains were picked for shake-flask fermentation and strain GS115-pHBM905BDM-pels4 showed the highest activity of 536 U/mL. Then plasmid pPIC9K-pels was constructed and electroporated into the GS115-pHBM905BDM-pels4 cells. Subsequently, high-copy transformant was screened by using the medium containing antibiotics G418, strain GS115-pHBM905BDMpPIC9K- pels1 was identified with increased activity of 770 U/mL and the copy number of pels was 7 confirmed by qPCR. Finally, the activity of pectate lyase produced by GS115-pHBM905BDM-pPIC9K-pels1reached to 2 271 U/mL in a 5-L fermentor. The activity of pectate lyase in our study reached the highest level of expression in P. pastoris, showing good application potential in the textile industry.</p></details><hr><h4>Functional characterization and discovery of modulators of SbMATE, the agronomically important aluminium tolerance transporter from Sorghum bicolor.</h4><p>R.

The low pH solubilizes root-toxic ionic aluminium (Al(3+)) species from clay minerals, driving the evolution of counteractive adaptations in cultivated crops. The food crop Sorghum bicolor upregulates the membrane-embedded transporter protein SbMATE in its roots. SbMATE mediates efflux of the anionic form of the organic acid, citrate, into the soil rhizosphere, chelating Al(3+) ions and thereby imparting Al-resistance based on excluding Al(+3) from the growing root tip. Here, we use electrophysiological, radiolabeled, and fluorescence-based transport assays in two heterologous expression systems to establish a broad substrate recognition profile of SbMATE, showing the proton and/or sodium-driven transport of (14C)-citrate anion, as well as the organic monovalent cation, ethidium, but not its divalent analog, propidium. We further complement our transport assays by measuring substrate binding to detergent-purified SbMATE protein. Finally, we use the purified membrane protein as an antigen to discover native conformation-binding and transport function-altering nanobodies using an animal-free, mRNA/cDNA display technology. Our results demonstrate the utility of using Pichia pastoris as an efficient eukaryotic host to express large quantities of functional plant transporter proteins. The nanobody discovery approach is applicable to other non-immunogenic plant proteins.</p></details><hr><h4>Thermo-alkali-stable alpha-carbonic anhydrase of Bacillus halodurans: heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and applicability in carbon sequestration.</h4><p>S.

The purified rBhCA from P. pastoris is a glycosylated protein that displays a higher molecular mass (79.5 kDa) than that produced from E. coli recombinant (75 kDa); the former has a Tm of 75 degrees C, which is slightly higher than that of the latter (72 degrees C). The former rBhCA exhibits higher thermostability than the latter. The former sequestered CO2 efficiently similar to that of the native BhCA and the latter.

Subramani, Autophagy  1 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29260977>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Macroautophagy/autophagy is a highly conserved process in which subcellular components destined for degradation are sequestered within autophagosomes. The selectivity of autophagy is determined by autophagy receptors, such as Pichia pastoris Atg30 (autophagy-related 30), which controls the selective degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) through the assembly of a receptor-protein complex (RPC). Previously, we proved that the peroxisomal acyl-CoA-binding protein, Atg37, and the highly conserved peroxin, Pex3, are required for RPC formation and efficient pexophagy. Here, we describe how Atg37 and Pex3 regulate the assembly and activation of the pexophagic RPC. We demonstrate that Atg30 requires both Atg37 and Pex3 to recruit Atg8 and Atg11 to the pexophagic RPC, because Atg37 depends on Pex3 for its localization at the peroxisomal membrane. We establish that due to close proximity of Atg37- and Pex3-binding sites in the middle domain of Atg30, the binding of these proteins to Atg30 is mutually exclusive within this region. We also show that direct binding of Pex3 and Atg37 to Atg30 regulates its phosphorylation by the Hrr25 kinase, negatively and positively, respectively. Based on these results we present a model that clarifies the assembly and activation of the pexophagic RPC through the phosphoregulation of Atg30.</p></details><hr><h4>Human LYPD8 protein inhibits motility of flagellated bacteria.</h4><p>C. C. Hsu, R. Okumura, K. Takeda, Inflamm Regen 37 23 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259722>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Background: We previously reported that the mouse Ly6/Plaur domain containing 8 (mLypd8), a GPI-anchored protein highly and selectively expressed on colonic epithelia, contributes to segregation of intestinal microbiota and intestinal epithelia and is critical for prevention of intestinal inflammation. In addition, it was found that human LYPD8 (hLYPD8) is expressed in the colonic epithelia and expression of hLYPD8 is reduced in some ulcerative colitis patients. However, the molecular characteristics and functions of hLYPD8 remain unclear. In this study, we generated the hLYPD8 protein and characterized its functions. Methods: To analyze the characteristics and functions of the hLYPD8 protein, recombinant FLAG-tagged hLYPD8 protein was generated by two kinds of protein expression systems: a mammalian cell expression system and a Pichia pastoris expression system. Recombinant hLYPD8 protein was analyzed by western blot analysis or deglycosylation assay. The effect of the protein on flagellated bacteria was examined by ELISA assay and motility assay using semi-agar plates. Results: hLYPD8 was a highly N-glycosylated GPI-anchored protein, like mLypd8. Moreover, recombinant hLYPD8 protein generated by the Pichia pastoris expression system using the SuperMan5 strain, which enabled production of a large number of proteins with human-like glycosylation, presented the high binding affinity and the motility inhibitory function to flagellated bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that hLYPD8 inhibits the motile activity of flagellated bacteria, many of which are involved in intestinal inflammation. The supplementation of recombinant hLYPD8 protein might be a novel therapeutic approach for intestinal inflammation of inflammatory bowel diseases.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineered monoculture and co-culture of methylotrophic yeast for de novo production of monacolin J and lovastatin from methanol.</h4><p>Y. Liu et al., Metab Eng 45 189 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258964>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>As a promising one-carbon renewable substrate for industrial biotechnology, methanol has attracted much attention. However, engineering of microorganisms for industrial production of pharmaceuticals using a methanol substrate is still in infancy. In this study, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was used to produce anti-hypercholesterolemia pharmaceuticals, lovastatin and its precursor monacolin J, from methanol. The biosynthetic pathways for monacolin J and lovastatin were first assembled and optimized in single strains using single copies of the relevant biosynthetic genes, and yields of 60.0mg/L monacolin J and 14.4mg/L lovastatin were obtained using methanol following pH controlled monoculture. To overcome limitations imposed by accumulation of intermediates and metabolic stress in monoculture, approaches using pathway splitting and co-culture were developed. Two pathway splitting strategies for monacolin J, and four for lovastatin were tested at different metabolic nodes. Biosynthesis of monacolin J and lovastatin was improved by 55% and 71%, respectively, when the upstream and downstream modules were separately accommodated in two different fluorescent strains, split at the metabolic node of dihydromonacolin L. However, pathway distribution at monacolin J blocked lovastatin biosynthesis in all designs, mainly due to its limited ability of crossing cellular membranes. Bioreactor fermentations were tested for the optimal co-culture strategies, and yields of 593.9mg/L monacolin J and 250.8mg/L lovastatin were achieved. This study provides an alternative method for production of monacolin J and lovastatin and reveals the potential of a methylotrophic yeast to produce complicated pharmaceuticals from methanol.</p></details><hr><h4>Production of fluorescent and cytotoxic K28 killer toxin variants through high cell density fermentation of recombinant Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>E. Giesselmann, B. Becker, M. J. Schmitt, Microb Cell Fact 16 228 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258515>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p></p><p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Virus infected killer strains of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae secrete protein toxins such as K28, K1, K2 and Klus which are lethal to sensitive yeast strains of the same or related species. K28 is somewhat unique as it represents an alpha/beta heterodimeric protein of the A/B toxin family which, after having bound to the surface of sensitive target cells, is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis and transported through the secretory pathway in a retrograde manner. While the current knowledge on yeast killer toxins is largely based on genetic screens for yeast mutants with altered toxin sensitivity, in vivo imaging of cell surface binding and intracellular toxin transport is still largely hampered by a lack of fluorescently labelled and biologically active killer toxin variants.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> In this study, we succeeded for the first time in the heterologous K28 preprotoxin expression and production of fluorescent K28 variants in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant P. pastoris GS115 cells were shown to successfully process and secrete K28 variants fused to mCherry or mTFP by high cell density fermentation. The fluorescent K28 derivatives were obtained in high yield and possessed in vivo toxicity and specificity against sensitive yeast cells. In cell binding studies the resulting K28 variants caused strong fluorescence signals at the cell periphery due to toxin binding to primary K28 receptors within the yeast cell wall. Thereby, the beta-subunit of K28 was confirmed to be the sole component required and sufficient for K28 cell wall binding.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSION:</strong> Successful production of fluorescent killer toxin variants of S. cerevisiae by high cell density fermentation of recombinant, K28 expressing strains of P. pastoris now opens the possibility to study and monitor killer toxin cell surface binding, in particular in toxin resistant yeast mutants in which toxin resistance is caused by defects in toxin binding due to alterations in cell wall structure and composition. This novel approach might be easily transferable to other killer toxins from different yeast species and genera. Furthermore, the fluorescent toxin variants described here might likewise represent a powerful tool in future studies to visualize intracellular A/B toxin trafficking with the help of high resolution single molecule imaging techniques.</p></details><hr><h4>Improvement of the catalytic efficiency of a hyperthermophilic xylanase from Bispora sp. MEY-1.</h4><p>X. Wang et al., PLoS One 12 e0189806 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253895>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Extremophilic xylanases have attracted great scientific and industrial interest. In this study, a GH10 xylanase-encoding gene, Xyl10E, was cloned from Bispora sp. MEY-1 and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Deduced Xyl10E shares the highest identities of 62% and 57% with characterized family GH10 xylanases from Talaromyces leycettanus and Penicillium canescens (structure 4F8X), respectively. Xyl10E was most active at 93 to 95 degrees C and pH 4.0, retained more than 75% or 48% of the initial activity when heated at 80 degrees C or 90 degrees C for 30 min, respectively, and hardly lost activity at pH 1.0 to 7.0, but was completely inhibited by SDS. Two residues, A160 and A161, located on loop 4, were identified to play roles in catalysis. Mutants A160D/E demonstrated higher affinity to substrate with lower Km values, while mutants A161D/E mainly displayed elevated Vmax values. All of these mutants had significantly improved catalytic efficiency. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, the mutation of A160E was able to affect the important substrate binding site Y204 and then improve the substrate affinity, and the mutation of A161D was capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the substrate to promote the substrate binding or accelerate the product release. This study introduces a highly thermophilic fungal xylanase and reveals the importance of loop 4 for catalytic efficiency.</p></details><hr><h4>Fructooligosaccharides production by Schedonorus arundinaceus sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase constitutively expressed to high levels in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>L. Hernandez et al., J Biotechnol 266 59 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246839>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris was engineered to express constitutively the mature region of sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST, EC 2.4.1.99) from Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus). The increase of the transgene dosage from one to nine copies enhanced 7.9-fold the recombinant enzyme (Sa1-SSTrec) yield without causing cell toxicity. Secretion driven by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor signal peptide resulted in periplasmic retention (38%) and extracellular release (62%) of Sa1-SSTrec to an overall activity of 102.1U/ml when biomass reached (106g/l, dry weight) in fed-batch fermentation using cane sugar for cell growth. The volumetric productivity of the nine-copy clone PGFT6x-308 at the end of fermentation (72h) was 1422.2U/l/h. Sa1-SSTrec purified from the culture supernatant was a monomeric glycoprotein optimally active at pH 5.0-6.0 and 45-50 degrees C. The removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by Endo Hf treatment decreased the enzyme stability but had no effect on the substrate and product specificities. Sa1-SSTrec converted sucrose (600g/l) into 1-kestose (GF2) and nystose (GF3) in a ratio 9:1 with their sum representing 55-60% (w/w) of the total carbohydrates in the reaction mixture. Variations in the sucrose (100-800g/l) or enzyme (1.5-15 units per gram of substrate) concentrations kept unaltered the product profile. Sa1-SSTrec is an attractive candidate enzyme for the industrial production of short-chain fructooligosaccharides, most particularly 1-kestose.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory lipase from the human pathogen Leishmania major: Heterologous expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris and biochemical characterization.</h4><p>S.

Recently, a unique secretory lipase from the human pathogen Leishmania donovani Ldlip3 has been identified and characterized. This lipase has a high identity with a putative triacylglycerol lipase of Leishmania major (Lmlip2). In the present study, Lmlip2 was expressed in the eukaryotic heterologous expression system Pichia pastoris as tagged enzyme of 308 amino acids. Maximal protein production was reached after 2 days of fermentation. Optimal Lmlip2 lipase activity was measured using the pH stat technique at pH 8 at 26 degrees C using vinyl esters and triacylglycerols (true lipids) as substrates. Moreover, biochemical characterization of Lmlip2 contained in culture supernatant, illustrates that L. major secreted lipase is active and stable at low temperatures especially 26 degrees and prefer neutral pH; concerning substrate specificityLmlip2 presents a preference for short chains lipid substrates vinyl esters such as VC2, VC3 and VC4 likewise, it is capable to hydrolyze long chain triacylglycerols like olive oil. Metal ions and surfactants tested in this study decrease Lmlip2 activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the relation between the lipase activity and the virulence. Thus, it could lead to the identification of novel targets to block cutaneous Leishmaniasis in human hosts.</p></details><hr><h4>Isolation of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen with antibody-conjugated superparamagnetic Fe3O4/SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles.</h4><p>M.

In this study, we developed antibody-conjugated super-paramagnetic Fe3O4/SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles as a highly selective method for isolation of expressed rHBsAg in yeast Pichia pastoris. For this purpose, first, iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared by co-precipitation method in alkali media and coated with silica. Then the surface was activated by amine groups and conjugated with oxidized antibodies. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) were used to study the physical properties of MNPs. To evaluate the efficacy of these MNPs as a purification technique successfully synthesized MNPs were added to the rHBsAg sample to couple with the antigen and then be isolated based on their magnetic property. In the present research, in the optimum condition, we could isolate 65% of total rHBsAg from the final vaccine sample with purity above 95%. In this procedure, the maximum obtained specific yield (mg HBsAg/mg MNPs) was equal to 37.6. These results underline the potential application of the immune-magnetic separation (IMS) in the future bioseparation systems.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous Protein Expression in Pichia pastoris: Latest Research Progress and Applications.</h4><p>V.

Over the past five years, different strategies to improve the efficiency of recombinant protein expression by this yeast strain have been developed; these include a patent-free protein expression kit, construction of the P. pastoris CBS7435Ku70 platform strain with its high efficiency in site-specific recombination of plasmid DNA into the genomic DNA, the design of synthetic promoters and their variants by combining different core promoters with multiple putative transcription factors, the generation of mutant GAP promoter variants with various promoter strengths, codon optimization, engineering the alpha-factor signal sequence by replacing the native glutamic acid at the Kex2 cleavage site with the other 19 natural amino acids and the addition of mammalian signal sequence to the yeast signal sequence, and the co-expression of single chaperones, multiple chaperones or helper proteins that aid in recombinant protein folding. Publically available high-quality genome data from multiple strains of P. pastoris GS115, DSMZ 70382, and CBS7435 and the continuous development of yeast expression kits have successfully promoted the metabolic engineering of this strain to produce carotenoids, xanthophylls, nootkatone, ricinoleic acid, dammarenediol-II, and hyaluronic acid. The cell-surface display of enzymes has obviously increased enzyme stability, and high-level intracellular expression of acyl-CoA and ethanol O-acyltransferase, lipase and d-amino acid oxidase has opened up applications in whole-cell biocatalysis for producing flavor molecules and biodiesel, as well as the deracemization of racemic amino acids. High-level expression of various food-grade enzymes, cellulases, and hemicellulases for applications in the food, feed and biorefinery industries is in its infancy and needs strengthening.</p></details><hr><h4>Reduced methanol input induces increased protein output by AOX1 promoter in a trans-acting elements engineered Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>J.

Heterobasidion irregulare is a white-rot phytopathogenic fungus that causes wood decay in conifers. The genome of this fungus encodes 10 putative Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs. We describe the first biochemical characterization of H. irregulare LPMOs through heterologous expression of two CBM-containing LPMOs from this fungus (HiLPMO9H, HiLPMO9I) in Pichia pastoris. The oxidization preferences and substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined. The two LPMOs were shown to cleave different carbohydrate components of plant cell walls. HiLPMO9H was active on cellulose and oxidized the substrate at the C1 carbon of the pyranose ring at beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas HiLPMO9I cleaved cellulose with strict oxidization at the C4 carbon of glucose unit at internal bonds, and also showed activity against glucomannan. We propose that the two LPMOs play different roles in the plant-cell-wall degrading system of H. irregulare for degradation of softwood and that the lignocellulose degradation mediated by this white-rot fungus may require collective efforts from multi-types of LPMOs.</p></details><hr><h4>Gene cloning and expression of fungal lignocellulolytic enzymes from the rumen of gayal (Bos frontalis).</h4><p>J.

The sequencing results showed that xynF1 and eglF2 had 903-bp, and 1,995-bp, open reading frames likely to encode beta-xylanase (XynF1) and beta-glucosidase (EglF2), respectively. The amino acid sequence of XynF1 had 99% coverage and 95% homology to the endo-beta-1,4-xylanase encoded by the cellulase gene of Orpinomyces sp. LT-3 (GenBank accession No. AEO51791.1). The amino acid sequence of EglF2 had 99% coverage and 93% homology to the beta-glucosidase encoded by the cellulase gene of Piromyces sp. E2 (GenBank accession No. CAC34952.1). Analysis using the SMART software showed that XynF1 contains a glycoside hydrolase family 11 functional module and a carbohydrate-binding module, while EglF2 contains a glycoside hydrolase family 1 functional module. XynF1 showed the highest relative enzymatic activity, up to 95%, at 45 degrees C and pH 4.2, while EglF2 showed the highest relative enzymatic activity, up to 95%, at 55 degrees C and pH 6.2. In this study, we achieved efficient expression of the xynF1 and eglF2 genes in Pichia pastoris, which laid a foundation for the practical application of the lignocellulolytic enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Constitutive expression of the active fragment of human vasostatin Vs30 in Pichia pastoris SMD1168H.</h4><p>S.

The vs30 gene was optimized for P. pastoris preferential codon usage and inserted into constitutive expression vector pGAPZalphaA. In addition, a plasmid with four copies of the expression cassette was obtained and transformed into P. pastoris. The flask fermentation conditions were: culture volume of 25 mL in 250 mL baffled flasks at 28 degrees C, pH 6 and harvest time of 48 h. Up to 21.07 mg/L Vs30 were attained and purified by ultrafiltration with a 30-kDa cut-off membrane and the recovery was 49.7%. Bioactivity of Vs30 was confirmed by the inhibition of cell proliferation, as well as the inhibition of the capillary-like structures formation of EA.hy926 cells in vitro.

Komagataella spp.) include overexpression of homologous and heterologous genes, and deletion of host genes. For metabolic and cell engineering purposes the simultaneous overexpression of more than one gene would often be required. Very recently, Golden Gate based libraries were adapted to optimize single expression cassettes for recombinant proteins in P. pastoris. However, an efficient toolbox allowing the overexpression of multiple genes at once was not available for P. pastoris.</p><p><strong> METHODS:</strong> With the GoldenPiCS system, we provide a flexible modular system for advanced strain engineering in P. pastoris based on Golden Gate cloning. For this purpose, we established a wide variety of standardized genetic parts (20 promoters of different strength, 10 transcription terminators, 4 genome integration loci, 4 resistance marker cassettes).</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> All genetic parts were characterized based on their expression strength measured by eGFP as reporter in up to four production-relevant conditions. The promoters, which are either constitutive or regulatable, cover a broad range of expression strengths in their active conditions (2-192% of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter P GAP ), while all transcription terminators and genome integration loci led to equally high expression strength. These modular genetic parts can be readily combined in versatile order, as exemplified for the simultaneous expression of Cas9 and one or more guide-RNA expression units. Importantly, for constructing multigene constructs (vectors with more than two expression units) it is not only essential to balance the expression of the individual genes, but also to avoid repetitive homologous sequences which were otherwise shown to trigger "loop-out" of vector DNA from the P. pastoris genome.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> GoldenPiCS, a modular Golden Gate-derived P. pastoris cloning system, is very flexible and efficient and can be used for strain engineering of P. pastoris to accomplish pathway expression, protein production or other applications where the integration of various DNA products is required. It allows for the assembly of up to eight expression units on one plasmid with the ability to use different characterized promoters and terminators for each expression unit.

The natural form of Talpha1 is N(alpha) -acetylated, which was supposed to be related to in vivo stability of the hormone. In this study, fusion protein Talpha1-HSA was constructed and expressed in Pichia pastoris. RimJ, a N(alpha) -acetyltransferase from E.coli, was also overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. In vitro acetylation of Talpha1-HSA in the presence of RimJ and acetyl coenzyme A resulted in N(alpha) -acetyl Talpha1-HSA. The N(alpha) -acetylation was determined by LC-MS/MS. Kinetic assay indicated that RimJ had a higher affinity to desacetyl Talpha1 than to Talpha1-HSA. Bioactivity assay revealed fully retained activity of Talpha1 when the hormone was connected to the N-terminus of the fusion protein, while the activity was compromised in our previously constructed HSA-Talpha1. With fully retained activity and N-terminal acetylation, N(alpha) -acetyl Talpha1-HSA was expected to be a more promising pharmaceutical agent than Talpha1.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and Purification of Rat Glucose Transporter 1 in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>R.

A putative cellulase gene (cbGH5) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 46 (GH5_46) was identified and cloned by degenerate PCR plus genome walking. The CbGH5 protein was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. It is the first bifunctional cellulase-xylanase reported in GH5_46 as well as in Chryseobacterium genus. The enzyme showed an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose of 3237 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 9, 90 degrees C and a xylanase activity on birchwood xylan of 1793 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) at pH 8, 90 degrees C. The activity level and thermophilicity are in the front rank of all the known cellulases and xylanases. Core hydrophobicity had a positive effect on the thermophilicity of this enzyme. When similar quantity of enzymatic activity units was applied on the straws of wheat, rice, corn and oilseed rape, CbGH5 could obtain 3.5-5.0x glucose and 1.2-1.8x xylose than a mixed commercial cellulase plus xylanase of Novozymes. When applied on spent mushroom substrates made from the four straws, CbGH5 could obtain 9.2-15.7x glucose and 3.5-4.3x xylose than the mixed Novozymes cellulase+xylanase. The results suggest that CbGH5 could be a promising candidate for industrial lignocellulosic biomass conversion.</p></details><hr><h4>Construction of a cellulose-metabolizing Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) by co-expressing glucanases and beta-glucosidase.</h4><p>T.

However, it cannot be directly metabolized by most microbes including Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris), which is a frequently employed host for heterologous protein expression and production of high-value compounds. A K. phaffii strain was engineered that constitutively co-expresses an endoglucanase and a beta-glucosidase both from Aspergillus niger and an exoglucanase from Trichoderma reesei under the control of bidirectional promoters. This engineered strain was able to grow on cellobiose and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) but not on Avicel. However, the detected release of cellobiose from Avicel by using the produced mixture of endoglucanase and exoglucanase as well as the released glucose from Avicel by using the produced mixture of all three cellulases at 50 degrees C indicated the production of exoglucanase under the liquid culture conditions. The successful expression of three cellulases in K. phaffii demonstrated the feasibility to enable K. phaffii to directly use cellulose as a carbon source for producing recombinant proteins or other high-value compounds.</p></details><hr><h4>Secretory expression of recombinant small laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>D.

Using an AOX1 promoter and alpha factor as a secretion signal, the recombinant P. pastoris harbouring the laccase gene (rSLAC) produced high titres of extracellular laccase (500+/-10U/l), which were further increased seven fold by pre-incubation at 80 degrees C for 30min. The enzyme ( approximately 38kDa) had an optimum activity at 80 degrees C, but optimum pH varied with substrate used. Km values for ABTS, SGZ and 2,6-DMP were 142.85muM, 10muM and 54.55muM and the corresponding kcat values were 60.6s(-1), 25.36s(-1) and 27.84s(-1), respectively. The t1/2 values of the rSLAC at 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C were 60h, 32h and 10h, respectively. The enzyme deactivation energy (Ed) was 117.275kJ/mol while DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS for thermal inactivation of the rSLAC were all positive. The rSLAC decolourised more than 90% of Brilliant Blue G and Trypan Blue dye in 6h without the addition of a mediator. High titres of SLAC expressed in P. pastoris enhance its potential for various industrial applications.</p></details><hr><h4>Exploring three different expression systems for recombinant expression of globins: Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and Spodoptera frugiperda.</h4><p>A.

Here, we explore the recombinant expression of globins in three different expression systems: Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and the baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda. We expressed two different human globin types in these three expression systems: I) the well-characterized neuroglobin and II) the uncharacterized, circular permutated globin domain of the large chimeric globin androglobin. It is clear from the literature that E.coli is the most used expression system for expression and purification of recombinant globins. However, the major disadvantage of E. coli is the formation of insoluble aggregates. We experienced that, for more complex multi-domain globins, like the chimeric globin androglobin, it is recommended to switch to a higher eukaryotic expression system.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression, purification and function of the extracellular domain of human RANK.</h4><p>Y.

In addition, this signaling pathway has also been shown to influence tumor progression as well as the development and function of the immune system. Therefore, blocking the interaction between RANKL and RANK is a new therapeutic approach to prevent bone-related diseases and cancer.</p><p><strong> RESULTS:</strong> The coding sequence encoding the extracellular domain of human RANK (RANK-N) was codon optimized for Pichia pastoris and cloned into the pPIC9K vector, and the recombinant plasmid was then transformed into P. pastoris. The expression of RANK-N protein was confirmed using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain and western blotting. Recombinant RANK-N protein was purified by a multistep process including ultrafiltration (UF), Sephadex G-50 size-exclusion chromatography and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange chromatography, which resulted in a purity >95%. We found that the RANK-N protein can block RANKL-RANK signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, using a patient-derived xenograft of human colon cancer, we found that the recombinant RANK-N protein can inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer.</p><p><strong> CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The results show that a simple system to express and purify functional RANK-N protein has been developed. This work has thus laid a foundation for further research and clinical applications of RANK-N protein in treating bone-related diseases or even colorectal cancer.</p></details><hr><h4>[Preparation of isotope dilution mass spectrometry standards based on glucose pulse].</h4><p>W.

The conventional procedure for getting fully U (1)(3)C-labeled metabolites is through batch cultivation, but intracellular metabolites concentrations by this method are generally low. By applying U (1)(3)C-labeled glucose pulse, combined with fast sampling and quenching, mixture of fully U (1)(3)C-labeled intracellular metabolites was successfully extracted with higher concentration from Pichia pastoris G/DSEL fed with fully U (1)(3)C-labeled glucose as only carbon source. Quantitative results from liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) show that concentrations of organic acids, sugar phosphates, amino acids and nucleotides were 2-10 folds higher than those without glucose pulse. Therefore, the glucose pulse method can efficiently improve the usage of fully U (1)(3)C-labeled glucose converting to (1)(3)C-labeled metabolites, and achieve the detection of intracellular metabolites with lower concentrate than the instrument detection limit.</p></details><hr><h4>Penicillium purpurogenum produces a novel endo-1,5-arabinanase, active on debranched arabinan, short arabinooligosaccharides and on the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl arabinofuranoside.</h4><p>F.

In this work, the biochemical properties of an endo-arabinanase (ABN1) are presented. A gene, coding for a potential ABN was mined from the genome. It includes three introns. The cDNA is 975 bp long and codes for a mature protein of 324 residues. The cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The enzyme is active on debranched arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides. In contrast to other characterized ABNs, inactive on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside (pNPAra), ABN1 is active on this substrate. The enzyme has an optimal pH of 4.5 and an optimal temperature of 30-35 degrees C. Calcium does not activate ABN1. ABN1 belongs to GH family 43 sub-family 6, and a Clustal alignment with sequences of characterized fungal ABNs shows highest identity (54.6%) with an ABN from Aspergillus aculeatus. A three-dimensional model of ABN1 was constructed and the docking with pNPAra was compared with similar models of an enzyme very active on this substrate and another lacking activity, both from GH family 43. Differences in the number of hydrogen bonds between enzyme and substrate, and distance between the substrate and the catalytic residues may explain the differences in activity shown by these enzymes.</p></details><hr><h4>Dual-substrate inhibition kinetic studies for recombinant human interferon gamma producing Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A.

In the present study, the growth inhibition kinetics of recombinant P. pastoris expressing human interferon gamma was studied under different initial substrate concentrations of gluconate (10-100 g L(-1)) and methanol (2-50 g L(-1)) in modified FM22 medium. The highest specific growth rate of 0.0206 and 0.019 hr(-1) was observed at 60 g L(-1) of gluconate and 10 g L(-1) of methanol, respectively. Various three- and four-parametric Monod-variant models were chosen to analyze the inhibition kinetics. The model parameters as well as goodness of fit were estimated using nonlinear regression analysis. The three-parameter Haldane model was found to be best fit for both gluconate (R(2) = 0.95) and methanol substrate (R(2) = 0.96). The parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that micromax, Ki, and Ks are the most sensitive parameters for both methanol and gluconate. Different substrate inhibition models were fitted to the growth kinetic data and the additive form of double Webb model was found to be the best to explain the growth kinetics of recombinant P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Fused IgY Fc and Polysaccharide Adjuvant Enhanced the Immune Effect of the Recombinant VP2 and VP5 Subunits-A Prospect for Improvement of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Subunit Vaccine.</h4><p>H.

Currently, subunit vaccines based on VP2 antigen expressed in prokaryotic systems are widely used in clinical settings. However, the immunogenicity of VP2 vaccines is limited because of their inherent defect that the structure of the antigen expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) may be different from its natural conformation. In this study, we fused VP2 and VP5 protective antigen genes and linked the chicken IgY Fc gene onto it. The eukaryotic expression plasmid carrying the fusion gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) to express the recombinant VP2-VP5-Fc protein. The recombinant protein was used as immunogen for evaluating immune response, and the recombinant VP2-Fc and VP2 proteins expressed in P. pastoris and the commercial VP2 subunit vaccines were used as controls. Moreover, Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), an immunomodulator found by our laboratory, was used as adjuvant to investigate its immune modulatory effects on immunogens. Chickens were divided into six groups and inoculated with VP2-VP5-Fc+TPPPS, VP2-VP5-Fc, VP2-Fc, VP2 vaccine, commercial VP2 subunit vaccine, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The recombinant VP2 subunit vaccine expressed in P. pastoris exhibited higher immunogenicity than the commercial VP2 subunit vaccine. The VP2-Fc protein showed a better effect than the VP2 protein, and the VP2-VP5-Fc subunit further improved the immune effects. In addition, TPPPS was proved to be a good immunopotentiator for the VP2-VP5-Fc subunit vaccine. Hence, the recombinant VP2-VP5-Fc subunit combined with TPPPS adjuvant exhibits potential as efficient IBDV vaccine to prevent infectious bursal disease.</p></details><hr><h4>Yeast Hog1 proteins are sequestered in stress granules during high-temperature stress.</h4><p>K. Shiraishi et al., J Cell Sci 131  (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29183915>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The yeast high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway plays a central role in stress responses. It is activated by various stresses, including hyperosmotic stress, oxidative stress, high-temperature stress and exposure to arsenite. Hog1, the crucial MAP kinase of the pathway, localizes to the nucleus in response to high osmotic concentrations, i.e. high osmolarity; but, otherwise, little is known about its intracellular dynamics and regulation. By using the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii, we found that CbHog1-Venus formed intracellular dot structures after high-temperature stress in a reversible manner. Microscopic observation revealed that CbHog1-mCherry colocalized with CbPab1-Venus, a marker protein of stress granules. Hog1 homologs in Pichia pastoris and Schizosaccharomyces pombe also exhibited similar dot formation under high-temperature stress, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hog1 (ScHog1)-GFP did not. Analysis of CbHog1-Venus in C. boidinii revealed that a beta-sheet structure in the N-terminal region was necessary and sufficient for its localization to stress granules. Physiological studies revealed that sequestration of activated Hog1 proteins in stress granules was responsible for downregulation of Hog1 activity under high-temperature stress.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.</p></details><hr><h4>Characterization of carp gonadotropins: Structure, annual profile, and carp and zebrafish pituitary topographic organization.</h4><p>L. Hollander-Cohen et al., Gen Comp Endocrinol   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29183794>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Two gonadotropins, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), are important players in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of vertebrates. In the present work, we describe the construction of recombinant (r) common carp (Cyprinus carpio; c) FSH (rcFSH) and LH (rcLH) using the Pichia pastoris system, the generation of specific antibodies against their respective beta subunits, and their use in the development and validation of specific ELISAs. We produced carp rLH and rFSH as single-chain polypeptides, wherein the GTH subunit alpha was joined with either cLHbeta or cFSHbeta mature protein-coding sequences to form a fusion gene that encodes a yoked polypeptide, in which the GTH beta-subunit forms the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit forms the C-terminal part. Competitive ELISAs were developed, using primary antibodies against rcLHbeta or rcFSHbeta, respectively, and rcLHbetaalpha or rcFSHbetaalpha for the standard curves. The standard curves for cLH paralleled those of pituitary extracts of the homologous fish and also those of other cyprinids species like the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). We used the specific antibodies raised against cFSH and cLH to study the specific localization of the different GTH cells in the pituitary of carp and its taxonomic relative species - the zebrafish. Both FSH and LH cells are localized in the center of the proximal pars distalis enveloping both sides of the neurohypophysis. LH cells form a continuous population throughout the PPD, while FSH cells are more loosely distributed throughout the same area and form small aggregations. Marked annual changes were encountered in gonadosomatic index (GSI), follicle diameter, mRNA levels and protein levels of FSH and LH. From September to November, all fish had low GSI, and the ovary contained previtellogenic follicles. From December, the GSI level increased and remained high until March, the follicular diameter reached its maximum in January, where the ovary contained large fully grown follicles. Thereafter, spawning occurred through March and April and ended in May, and GSI level and follicle diameter increased again; and the ovary contained mid-vitellogenic follicles. LH pituitary content and mRNA levels were low at pre- and early vitellogenesis, increasing gradually during this process to reach a peak of LH mRNA levels in mid vitellogenic ovary and a peak of LH content in fully grown ovarian follicles. However, no significant change occurred in FSH pituitary content and mRNA levels in vitellogenic fish and in fish during final maturation stages. A dramatic difference was found in the total content of each gonadotropin in the pituitary, with higher LH than FSH. Moreover, follicle diameter was positively and significantly correlated with LH pituitary content and its transcript levels - but not with the pituitary content or mRNA levels of FSH. Taken together, these results indicate that in carp, LH alone is sufficient to regulate both vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation while FSH may have another, yet undefined role.</p></details><hr><h4>Improving the Secretion Yield of the beta-Galactosidase Bgal1-3 in Pichia pastoris for Use as a Potential Catalyst in the Production of Prebiotic-Enriched Milk.</h4><p>L.

Then, Bgal1-3 was secreted from Pichia pastoris X33 under the direction of an alpha-factor signal peptide. After cultivation for 144 h in a flask culture with shaking, the extracellular activity of Bgal1-3 was 4.4 U/mL. Five more signal peptides (HFBI, apre, INU1A, MF4I, and W1) were employed to direct the secretion, giving rise to a more efficient signal peptide, W1 (11.2 U/mL). To further improve the secretion yield, recombinant strains harboring two copies of the bgal1-3 gene were constructed, improving the extracellular activity to 22.6 U/mL (about 440 mg/L). This study successfully constructed an engineered strain for the production of the beta-galactosidase Bgal1-3, which is a promising catalyst in the preparation of prebiotic-enriched milk.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of single-domain antibody in different systems.</h4><p>Y.

These VHHs possess unique structural and functional features, as they are small in size and exhibit thermal stability and high solubility. Compared to conventional antibodies, VHHs can be manufactured in microorganisms to significantly save on cost, labor, and time since VHHs lack the Fc domain with its N-linked oligosaccharide. Until now, VHHs have been expressed in several kinds of production systems, ranging from prokaryotic cells, yeasts, fungi, insect cells, and mammalian cell lines, to plants. In this review, we focus on the recent production of VHHs, introduce different platforms, and summarize the current state of this area and its future trends. Finally, the first potential VHH product, produced in Pichia pastoris, will probably be available on the market in 2018; thus, it is of great importance to give this antibody fragment timely attention. This is the first review concerning the production of VHHs in laboratory settings.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification of novel factors enhancing recombinant protein production in multi-copy Komagataella phaffii based on transcriptomic analysis of overexpression effects.</h4><p>X.

However, overexpression of recombinant protein often leads to severe burden on the physiology of K. phaffii and triggers cellular stress. To elucidate the global effect of protein overexpression, we set out to analyze the differential transcriptome of recombinant strains with 12 copies and a single copy of phospholipase A2 gene (PLA 2) from Streptomyces violaceoruber. Through GO, KEGG and heat map analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes, the results indicated that the 12-copy strain suffered heavy cellular stress. The genes involved in protein processing and stress response were significantly upregulated due to the burden of protein folding and secretion, while the genes in ribosome and DNA replication were significantly downregulated possibly contributing to the reduced cell growth rate under protein overexpression stress. Three most upregulated heat shock response genes (CPR6, FES1, and STI1) were co-overexpressed in K. phaffii and proved their positive effect on the secretion of reporter enzymes (PLA2 and prolyl endopeptidase) by increasing the production up to 1.41-fold, providing novel helper factors for rational engineering of K. phaffii.</p></details><hr><h4>Fungal feruloyl esterases: Functional validation of genome mining based enzyme discovery including uncharacterized subfamilies.</h4><p>A.

FAEs as auxiliary enzymes significantly assist xylanolytic and pectinolytic enzymes in gaining access to their site of action during biomass saccharification for biofuel and biochemical production. A limited number of FAEs have been functionally characterized compared to over 1000 putative fungal FAEs that were recently predicted by similarity-based genome mining, which divided phylogenetically into different subfamilies (SFs). In this study, 27 putative and six characterized FAEs from both ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi were selected and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant proteins biochemically characterized to validate the previous genome mining and phylogenetical grouping and to expand the information on activity of fungal FAEs. As a result, 20 enzymes were shown to possess FAE activity, being active towards pNP-ferulate and/or methyl hydroxycinnamate substrates, and covering 11 subfamilies. Most of the new FAEs showed activities comparable to those of previously characterized fungal FAEs.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression of catalytically efficient xylanases from thermophilic fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea for synergistically enhancing hydrolysis of lignocellulosics.</h4><p>N.

The purified recombinant rXYN11A_MALCI was stable at 70 degrees C and catalytically active against a variety of substituted (arabinoxylans) as well as unsubstituted xylans. The hydrolytic potential of recombinant xylanases for enhancing the hydrolysis of acid/alkali pretreated lignocellulosics (rice straw and bagasse) by the commercial cellulase Cellic CTec2 was assessed which revealed that both rXYN10A_MALCI and rXYN11A_MALCI act synergistically with commercial cellulases and resulted in 1.54 and 1.58 folds improved hydrolysis of acid treated rice straw and alkali treated rice straw using cocktail comprising of Cellic CTec2 and XYN11A_MALCI (8:2 ratio) when compared to Cellic CTec2 alone at same protein loading rate of ( approximately 5.7mg/g biomass).</p></details><hr><h4>A novel tumor-activated ALA fusion protein for specific inhibition on the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231.</h4><p>X.

This study systematically investigated the capacity of different biotechnically relevant yeast species and strains including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Candida glabrata to initiate maturation of human DC. As important prerequisite for T-cell activation, all yeasts were shown to effectively induce, though to a different extent, the expression of the activation marker CD83, the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, CD54, CD58, and CD40, as well as the antigen-presenting molecules MHCs I and II. Furthermore, yeast-activated DC secreted various cytokines including inflammatory TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta or T-cell polarizing IL-12, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-27. Variability was observed in the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in response to the tested yeasts, whereas expression levels of IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 were similar. Interestingly, maturation marker expression and cytokine secretion were not negatively affected after application of yeast mutants with altered cell wall mannoprotein structure (Deltamnn11) or defective in protein N-glycosylation (Deltaost3), indicating that elongated cell wall mannoproteins at the outer yeast cell surface are not a prerequisite for the observed yeast-mediated DC maturation. Thus, our data provide a valuable basic knowledge for the future design of effective yeast-based delivery approaches.</p></details><hr><h4>The Verticillium dahliae SnodProt1-Like Protein VdCP1 Contributes to Virulence and Triggers the Plant Immune System.</h4><p>Y.

In this study, an integrated proteomic analysis of secreted V. dahliae proteins was performed, and a conserved secretory protein, designated VdCP1, was identified as a member of the SnodProt1 phytotoxin family. An expression analysis of the vdcp1 gene revealed that the transcript is present in every condition studied and displays elevated expression throughout the infection process. To investigate the natural role of VdCP1 in V. dahliae, two vdcp1 knockout mutants and their complementation strains were generated. Bioassays of these mutants revealed no obvious phenotypic differences from the wild-type (WT) in terms of mycelial growth, conidial production or mycelial/spore morphology. However, compared with the WT, the vdcp1 knockout mutants displayed attenuated pathogenicity in cotton plants. Furthermore, treating plants with purified recombinant VdCP1 protein expressed in Pichia pastoris induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of several defense-related genes, leakage of ion electrolytes, enhancement of defense-related enzyme activity and production of salicylic acid. Moreover, VdCP1 conferred resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci in tobacco and to V. dahliae in cotton. Further research revealed that VdCP1 possesses chitin-binding properties and that the growth of vdcp1 knockout mutants was more affected by treatments with chitinase, indicating that VdCP1 could protect V. dahliae cell wall from enzymatic degradation, which suggests an effector role of VdCP1 in infecting hosts.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification, expression analysis, and antibacterial activity of NK-lysin from common carp Cyprinus carpio.</h4><p>G.

Nevertheless, the implication of NK-lysin in the protection against bacterial infection is not aware in common carp. In this study, six different NK-lysin genes (nkl1, nkl2, nkl3, nkl4, nkl5 and nkl6) were identified in the common carp genome. Each of the mature peptides of common carp NK-lysin has six well-conserved cysteine residues, and shares a Saposin B domain, characteristic of saposin-like protein (SALIP) family. The gene nkl1 contains 5 extrons and 4 introns, and nkl2, nkl3, nkl4 or nkl5 contains 4 extrons and 3 introns, however, the nkl6 has 3 extrons and 2 introns. By quantitative real-time PCR, nkl2 transcripts were predominantly expressed in spleen of healthy common carp, while elevated mainly in gill and spleen upon Aeromonas hydrophila infection. The recombinant NK-lysin-2 purified from Pichia pastoris shows antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli M15, Aeromonas hydrophila, as well as Edwardsiella tarda (Gram-negative), the latter two are important pathogens of aquaculture. Our results indicate that NK-lysin in common carp might play an important role in fish immune response by enhancing antibacterial defense against bacterial pathogens.</p></details><hr><h4>Fine-tuning the P. pastoris iMT1026 genome-scale metabolic model for improved prediction of growth on methanol or glycerol as sole carbon sources.</h4><p>M.

In the past recent years, important breakthroughs in the systems-level quantitative analysis of its physiology have been achieved. This wealth of information has allowed the development of genome-scale metabolic models, which make new approaches possible for host cell and bioprocess engineering. Nevertheless, the predictive accuracy of the previous consensus model required to be upgraded and validated with new experimental data sets for P. pastoris growing on glycerol or methanol as sole carbon sources, two of the most relevant substrates for this cell factory. In this study, we have characterized P. pastoris growing in chemostat cultures using glycerol or methanol as sole carbon sources over a wide range of growth rates, thereby providing physiological data on the effect of growth rate and culture conditions on biomass macromolecular and elemental composition. In addition, these data sets were used to improve the performance of the P. pastoris consensus genomic-scale metabolic model iMT1026. Thereupon, new experimentally determined bounds, including the representation of biomass composition for these growth conditions, have been incorporated. As a result, here, we present version 3 (v3.0) of the consensus P. pastoris genome-scale metabolic model as an update of the iMT1026 model. The v3.0 model was validated for growth on glycerol and methanol as sole carbon sources, demonstrating improved prediction capabilities over an extended substrate range including two biotechnologically relevant carbon sources.</p></details><hr><h4>Expression and purification of plant fructan exohydrolases and their potential applications in fructose production.</h4><p>W.

When heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33, Ht1-FEH III not only demonstrated hydrolysis activity towards beta (2, 1)-linked fructans and beta (2, 6)-linked levan, but also towards sucrose. To explore the potential industrial applications, we heterologously expressed and purified six plant 1-FEHs from two typical fructan plants (i.e., chicory and Jerusalem artichoke) and showed that chicory Ci1-FEH IIa had the highest hydrolysis capacity to fructan in vitro. Furthermore, we immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa on resin and optimized the immobilization conditions. We found that inulin-type fructan or the tuber extract from Jerusalem artichoke could be rapidly degraded into fructose and sucrose by immobilized Ci1-FEH IIa. The capacity of Ci1-FEH IIa to release fructose from fructans was comparable to that of some inulinases from microorganisms. Thus, plant FEHs have potential applications in fructose production.</p></details><hr><h4>High-Efficiency Expression of Yeast-Derived G-Protein Coupled Receptors and (19)F Labeling for Dynamical Studies.</h4><p>L.

The gene encoding the endoglucanase from Scytalidium thermophilum (egst) was cloned and expressed as a soluble protein in Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant enzyme (Egst) was monomeric (66 kDa) and showed an estimated carbohydrate content of 53.3% (w/w). The optimum temperature and pH of catalysis were 60-70 degrees C and pH of 5.5, respectively. The enzyme was highly stable at pH 3.0-8.0 with a half-life in water of 100 min at 65 degrees C. The Egst presented good halotolerance, retaining 84.1 and 71.4% of the control activity in the presence of 0.5 and 2.0 mol L(-1) NaCl, respectively. Hydrolysis of medium viscosity carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) by Egst was stimulated 1.77-, 1.84-, 1.64-, and 1.8-fold by dithiothreitol, beta-mercaptoethanol, cysteine, and manganese at 10, 10, 10, and 5 mmol L(-1) concentration, respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed CMC with maximal velocity and an apparent affinity constant of 432.10 +/- 16.76 and 10.5 +/- 2.53 mg mL(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the Egst was tolerant to reaction products and able to act on pretreated fractions sugarcane bagasse demonstrating excellent properties for application in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>A streamlined cloning workflow minimising the time-to-strain pipeline for Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>K.

Here, we have refined the technique and incorporated it into a streamlined workflow for the generation of Pichia pastoris expression strains, reducing the timeline by a third and removing the reliance on DNA editing enzymes, which often require troubleshooting and increase costs. We have validated the workflow by cloning 24 human proteins of biopharmaceutical value, either as direct therapeutics or as research targets, which span a continuous range in size and GC content. This includes demonstrating the applicability of the workflow to three-part assemblies for a monoclonal antibody and its single-chain antibody fragments derivatives. This workflow should enable future research into recombinant protein production by P. pastoris and a synthetic biology approach to this industrial host.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression and characterization of a new lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and used for biodiesel production.</h4><p>W.

Pflip1, a new extracellular lipase gene from Pseudomonas. fluorescens Pf0-1, was first cloned and respectively expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and Pichia pastoris KM71, the recombinant proteins Pflip1a and Pflip1b were later purified separately. Then Pflip1a was further characterized. The optimum pH of Pflip1a was 8.0 and its optimal temperature was 70 degrees C. After incubation at 70 degrees C for 12 h, Pflip1a could retain over 95% of its original activity. It showed the highest activity towards p-nitrophenyl caprylate. Moreover, its activity was profoundly affected by metal ion, ionic surfactants and organic solvents. Furthermore, the two obtained recombinant lipases were immobilized on the magnetic nanoparticles for biodiesel preparation. The GC analysis showed that for the immobilized lipases Pflip1b and Pflip1a, the biodiesel yield within 24 h respectively attained 68.5% and 80.5% at 70 degrees C. The activities of the two immobilized lipases still remained 70% and 82% after 10 cycles of operations in non-solvent system. These characteristics and transesterification capacity of the recombinant protein indicated its great potential for organic synthesis, especially for biodiesel production.</p></details><hr><h4>Identification and expression of complement component C8alpha, C8beta and C8gamma gene in half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and C8alpha recombinant protein antibacterial activity analysis.</h4><p>G.

The cDNA sequences of the C8alpha, C8beta and C8gamma genes were cloned from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). Full-length cDNA of CsC8alpha (C8alpha of C. semilaevis), CsC8beta and CsC8gamma was 1990, 2219 and 886 bp, respectively, which contained open reading frames of 1797, 1749 and 666 bp, encoding 598, 582 and 221 amino acids, respectively. The deduced proteins of CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma showed the closest amino acid similarity to C8alpha (73%) of Siniperca chuatsi, C8beta (76%) of Oryzias latipes and C8gamma (72%) of Takifugu rubripes, respectively. The highest expression level of CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma among the 13 normal tissues was observed in liver tissue, followed by much lower levels in other tissues. After infection with Vibrio anguillarum, CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma were significantly up-regulated in all of the detected tissues, including the intestine, liver, gill, head kidney, blood and spleen. Then, a recombinant expression plasmid was constructed, and the recombinant CsC8alpha protein was expressed in GS115 pichia pastoris yeast. Furthermore, to investigate the biological functions of recombinant CsC8alpha, an antibacterial assay was performed, and the results showed that recombinant CsC8alpha obviously inhibited growth of V. anguillarum, Edwardsiella tarda and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Taken together, these results suggest that CsC8alpha, CsC8beta and CsC8gamma may play important roles in the immune defense of C. semilaevis.</p></details><hr><h4>Sialic acid-binding lectins (SABLs) from Solen grandis function as PRRs ensuring immune recognition and bacterial clearance.</h4><p>X.

In present study, recombinant protein and antibodies of two SABLs from mollusk Solen grandis (SgSABL-1 and SgSABL-2) were prepared to investigate their functions in innate immunity. The recombinant protein of SgSABL-1 (rSgSABL-1) could bind LPS, PGN and beta-glucan in vitro, while rSgSABL-2 could only bind PGN rather than LPS and beta-glucan. Be coincident with their PAMPs recognition properties, rSgSABL-1 displayed a broad agglutination spectrum towards gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus, gram-negative bacteria Listonella anguillarum and fungi Pichia pastoris, and rSgSABL-2 only showed remarkable agglutinative effect on M. luteus and L. anguillarum. More importantly, after PAMPs recognition, rSgSABL-1 and rSgSABL-2 enhanced phagocytosis as well as encapsulation ability of hemocytes in vitro, and the enhanced encapsulation could be blocked by specific antibodies. All these results indicated that SgSABL-1 and SgSABL-2 functioned as two compensative pattern-recognition receptor (PRRs) with distinct recognition spectrum and involved in the innate immune response of S. grandis.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel, highly efficient beta-glucosidase with a cellulose-binding domain: characterization and properties of native and recombinant proteins.</h4><p>J. A. Mendez-Liter et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 10 256 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29142591>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Background: Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on earth, is an alternative for fossil fuels as a renewable feedstock for the production of second-generation biofuels and other chemicals. The discovery of novel, highly efficient beta-glucosidases remains as one of the major bottlenecks for cellulose degradation. In this context, the ascomycete Talaromyces amestolkiae, isolated from cereal samples, has been studied as a promising source for these enzymes. Results: BGL-2 is the major beta-glucosidase secreted by this fungus in the presence of cellulosic inductors. This enzyme possesses a CBD (Cellulose Binding Domain), an unusual feature among this type of proteins. Besides, when growing on cellulose, the fungus produced two different bgl-2 mRNAs that were cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. A complete recombinant protein (BGL-2*) and its truncated form, lacking CBD (BGL-2T*), have been purified, characterized and compared with the native enzyme (BGL-2). The three BGL-2 forms studied are highly stable in a wide pH range, but BGL-2T* showed an improved thermal stability at 50 degrees C after 72 h. Using p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside as a substrate, the steady-state kinetic characterization of the three proteins showed a similar Km and kcat for BGL-2 and BGL-2*, while the truncated protein displayed a threefold higher value for kcat . All tested BGL-2 enzymes were as well highly efficient using cellobiose and other short oligosaccharides as a substrate. In view of biotechnological applications, the recombinant T. amestolkiae enzymes in saccharification of brewers' spent grain were studied, being comparable to commercial beta-glucosidase cocktails. Conclusion: A new beta-glucosidase from T. amestolkiae has been studied. The enzyme, containing a functional CBD, has been expressed in P. pastoris. The comparative analyses of the native protein and its recombinant forms, with and without CBD, suggest that they could be suitable tools for valorization of lignocellulosic biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>Integrating metabolic modeling and population heterogeneity analysis into optimizing recombinant protein production by Komagataella (Pichia) pastoris.</h4><p>C.

This success story is linked to its specific physiological traits, i.e., the ability to grow at high cell density in inexpensive culture medium and to secrete proteins at high yield. Exploiting methanol metabolism is at the core of most P. pastoris-based processes but comes with its own challenges. Co-feeding cultures with glycerol/sorbitol and methanol is a promising approach, which can benefit from improved understanding and prediction of metabolic response. The development of profitable processes relies on the construction and selection of efficient producing strains from less efficient ones but also depends on the ability to master the bioreactor process itself. More specifically, how a bioreactor processes could be monitored and controlled to obtain high yield of production. In this review, new perspectives are detailed regarding a multi-faceted approach to recombinant protein production processes by P. pastoris; including gaining improved understanding of the metabolic pathways involved, accounting for variations in transcriptional and translational efficiency at the single cell level and efficient monitoring and control of methanol levels at the bioreactor level.</p></details><hr><h4>Engineering strategies for enhanced production of protein and bio-products in Pichia pastoris: A review.</h4><p>Z.

Despite its high protein productivity, the optimization of P. pastoris cultivation is still imperative due to strain- and product-specific challenges such as promoter strength, methanol utilization type and oxygen demand. To address the issues, strategies involving genetic and process engineering have been employed. Optimization of codon usage and gene dosage, as well as engineering of promoters, protein secretion pathways and methanol metabolic pathways have proved beneficial to innate protein expression levels. Large-scale production of proteins via high cell density fermentation additionally relies on the optimization of process parameters including methanol feed rate, induction temperature and specific growth rate. Recent progress related to the enhanced production of proteins in P. pastoris via various genetic engineering and cultivation strategies are reviewed. Insight into the regulation of the P. pastoris alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and the development of methanol-free systems are highlighted. Novel cultivation strategies such as mixed substrate feeding are discussed. Recent advances regarding substrate and product monitoring techniques are also summarized. Application of P. pastoris to the production of biodiesel and other value-added products via metabolic engineering are also reviewed. P. pastoris is becoming an indispensable platform through the use of these combined engineering strategies.</p></details><hr><h4>Antibacterial, antifungal and anticoagulant activities of chicken PLA2 group V expressed in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>A.

As a first step towards understanding the structure, function and regulation of this PLA2, we report the expression and characterization of PLA2-V from chicken (ChPLA2-V). The ChPLA2-V cDNA was synthesized from chicken heart polyA mRNA by RT-PCR, and an expression construct containing the PLA2 was established. After expression in Pichia pastoris cells, the active enzyme was purified. The purified ChPLA2-V protein was biochemically and physiologically characterized. The recombinant ChPLA2-V has an absolute requirement for Ca(2+) for enzymatic activity. The optimum pH for this enzyme is pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer with phosphatidylcholine as substrate. ChPLA2-V was found to display potent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bactericidal activity and antifungal activity in vitro. The purified enzyme ChPLA2-V with much stronger anticoagulant activity compared with the intestinal and pancreatic chicken PLA2-V was approximately 10 times more active. Chicken group V PLA2, like mammal one, may be considered as a future therapeutic agents against fungal and bacterial infections and as an anticoagulant agent.</p></details><hr><h4>Thermostability improvement of a Talaromyces leycettanus xylanase by rational protein engineering.</h4><p>X.

This study identified a GH11 xylanase gene, Tlxyn11B, in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802. Recombinant TlXyn11B produced in Pichia pastoris is distinguished by high specific activity (8259 +/- 32 U/mg with beechwood xylan as substrate) and excellent pH stability (from 1.0 to 10.5). The beechwood xylan hydrolysates consisted mainly of xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose, thus TlXyn11B could be used for the production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharide. By using the structure-based rational approach, the N-terminal sequence of TlXyn11B was modified for thermostability improvement. Mutants S3F and S3F/D35V/I/Q/M had elevated T m values of 60.01 to 67.84 degrees C, with S3F/D35I the greatest. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis revealed that the substituted F3 and I35 formed a sandwich structure with S45 and T47, which may enhance the overall structure rigidity with lowered RMSD values. This study verifies the efficiency of rational approach in thermostability improvement and provides a xylanase candidate of GH11 with great commercialization potential.</p></details><hr><h4>Production and purification of chimeric HBc virus-like particles carrying influenza virus LAH domain as vaccine candidates.</h4><p>A.

Here a systematic replacement studies of the core promoter and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the exceptionally strong and tightly methanol regulated Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter at unprecedented resolution is performed. Adjacent triplets of the 200 bp long core promoter are mutated at a time by changing the wild-type sequence into cytosine or adenine triplets, resulting in 130 variants that are cloned upstream of an eGFP reporter gene providing a library for expression fine-tuning. Mutations in the TATA box motif, regions downstream of the transcription start site or next to the start codon in the 5'UTR had a significant effect on the eGFP fluorescence. Surprisingly, mutations in most other regions are tolerated, indicating that yeast core promoters can show a high tolerance toward small mutations, supporting regulatory models of degenerate motifs, or redundant design. The authors exploited these neutral core promoter positions, not affecting expression, to introduce extrinsic sequence elements such as cloning sites (allowing targeted core promoter/5'UTR modifications) and bacterial promoters (applicable in multi host vectors).</p></details><hr><h4>Properties of two fungal endo-beta-1,3-galactanases and their synergistic action with an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase in degrading arabinogalactan-proteins.</h4><p>Y. Yoshimi et al., Carbohydr Res 453-454 26 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121496>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are plant proteoglycans, which are widely encountered in the plant kingdom, usually localized on the cell surface. The carbohydrate moieties of AGPs consist of beta-1,3-galactan main chains and beta-1,6-galactan side chains, to which other auxiliary sugars are attached. To date, FvEn3GAL isolated from Flammulina velutipes is the sole beta-1,3-galactanase acting on beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner. Here we cloned two homologous genes, designated Af3G and NcEn3GAL, possibly encoding endo-beta-1,3-galactanase from Aspergillus flavus and Neurospora crassa, respectively. The recombinant Af3G (rAf3G) and rNcEn3GAL expressed in Pichia pastoris specifically hydrolyzed beta-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner, as did the rFvEn3GAL. Among galactooligosaccharides, beta-1,3-galactotriose was identified as the smallest substrate for these enzymes. These results suggest that enzymatic characteristics are conserved in many endo-beta-1,3-galactanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 16 family. On the other hand, rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL generated more beta-1,3-galactobiose from beta-1,3-galactotetraose than did rFvEn3GAL, suggesting that rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL prefer hydrolyzing the central beta-1,3-glycosidic linkage of three in beta-1,3-galactotetraose. Although rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL alone hardly hydrolyze native AGP, they acted synergistically with a fungal exo-beta-1,3-galactanase on the AGP. These endo-beta-1,3-galactanases presumably aid hydrolysis by internally breaking up AGPs, which creates more sites of attack for exo-beta-1,3-galactanase.</p></details><hr><h4>Efficient production and characterization of the novel and highly active antifungal protein AfpB from Penicillium digitatum.</h4><p>S.

Fungi are considered immune to their own AFPs as occurs in Penicillium chrysogenum, the producer of the well-known PAF. The Penicillium digitatum genome encodes only one afp gene (afpB), and the corresponding protein (AfpB) belongs to the class B phylogenetic cluster. Previous attempts to detect AfpB were not successful. In this work, immunodetection confirmed the absence of AfpB accumulation in wild type and previous recombinant constitutive P. digitatum strains. Biotechnological production and secretion of AfpB were achieved in P. digitatum with the use of a P. chrysogenum-based expression cassette and in the yeast Pichia pastoris with the alpha-factor signal peptide. Both strategies allowed proper protein folding, efficient production and single-step purification of AfpB from culture supernatants. AfpB showed antifungal activity higher than the P. chrysogenum PAF against the majority of the fungi tested, especially against Penicillium species and including P. digitatum, which was highly sensitive to the self-AfpB. Spectroscopic data suggest that native folding is not required for activity. AfpB also showed notable ability to withstand protease and thermal degradation and no haemolytic activity, making AfpB a promising candidate for the control of pathogenic fungi.</p></details><hr><h4>Fungal mannosylation enhances human papillomavirus 16 E7 therapeutic immunity against TC-1 tumors.</h4><p>Z.

Recently, three prophylactic HPV vaccines targeting high-risk HPVs (particularly HPV16 and HPV18) have been implemented to protect younger women. However, individuals with pre-existing infections have no benefit from prophylactic vaccines. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic vaccines. HPV16 E7 has been widely utilized as a target for immune therapy of HPV16-associated lesions or cancers, reflecting the sustained existence of this virus in cancerous cells. We developed mannosylated HPV16 E7 (mE7) expressed from Pichia pastoris as a therapeutic vaccine against HPV16-associated cancer. Unmannosylated E7 (E7) was also generated from Pichia pastoris as a control. Mannosylation enhanced the uptake of mE7 by mannose receptors of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), while the uptake of E7 was unaffected. mE7-uptake BMDCs in vitro induced more IFN-gamma secretion by splenocytes of immunized mice than E7. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with mE7 combined with adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) elicited stronger Th1 (type 1 T helper cell) responses and E7-specific T cell responses than E7. The mE7 vaccine induced the increased production of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha, elicited more E7-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T cells in spleen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) and promoted stronger E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses compared with E7. Furthermore, TC-1 tumor challenged mice were used to confirm the antitumor activity of the vaccines. As a result, mE7 generated complete antitumor activity against TC-1 tumors, while E7 only provided partial antitumor activity. Taken together, mE7 can be a promising immunotherapy for treating cervical cancer.</p></details><hr><h4>Combined effect of gene dosage and process optimization strategies on high-level production of recombinant human interleukin-3 (hIL-3) in Pichia pastoris fed-batch culture.</h4><p>V.

The in-vitro multimerization method was used to generate various Pichia X-33 transformants having multi-copy expression cassettes. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) strategy was used to further confirm the genome integration of hIL-3 expression cassette. From shake flask expression studies, the recombinant hIL-3 concentration in culture supernatant increased upto 8 copies to a level of 310mg/L, thereafter a considerably lower expression was observed. The small scale optimization experiments at shake flask level resulted in an improved product concentration of 350mg/L. The batch and fed-batch fermentation runs in complex medium showed a product concentration of 1.81 and 1.49g/L, respectively. To further enhance the production level, the fermentation runs were conducted in modified minimal media where a maximum hIL-3 protein level of 2.23g/L was obtained in batch fermentation. The specific product yield (YP/X) was at a level of 25.65mg/g DCW, whereas the overall volumetric productivity of the process was 27.31mg/L/h. The biological activity of the partially purified hIL-3 protein was confirmed via the proliferation of human erythroleukemia TF-1 cells using MTT assay.</p></details><hr><h4>High-level heterologous production and Functional Secretion by recombinant Pichia pastoris of the shortest proline-rich antibacterial honeybee peptide Apidaecin.</h4><p>X. Chen et al., Sci Rep 7 14543 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109421>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Drug resistance is a major problem in antibacterial chemotherapy. Apidaecins, which refer to a series of small, proline-rich antimicrobial peptides, are predominantly active against many drug-resistant bacteria. The apidaecins have special antibacterial mechanisms, and are non-toxic for human cells, a prerequisite for using them as novel antibiotic drugs. However, no efficient non-tagged apidaecin expression system has been reported, which is the limiting factor for their application. Here we successfully generated a Pichia pastoris transformant expressing and secreting apidaecin. However, expression was unstable and poor. Analysis of this revealed that the integration plasmid was frequently lost and that apidaecin expression resulted in cell death. Using N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine mutagenesis and selection, a mutant strain Apmu4 was derived, in which the rate of loss of the integration plasmid was much lower after induction, and which produced improved titres of apidaecin. Additionally, we discovered that using glucose as the sole carbon source to pre-culture the strain before induction could greatly enhance apidaecin production. A pilot-scale 10 L fermentation yielded 418 mg/L of recombinant apidaecin, which represents the highest reported yield of apidaecin. Consequently, this study reports the first super heterologous expression and secretion of apidaecin in yeast.</p></details><hr><h4>Optimized expression of the Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase in Pichia pastoris through temperature adaptation, codon-optimization and co-expression with HAC1.</h4><p>S. De Waele et al., Protein Expr Purif 143 62 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108944>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The Starmerella bombicola lactone esterase (SBLE) is a novel enzyme that, in vivo, catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of acidic sophorolipids in an aqueous environment. In fact, this is an unusual reaction given the unfavorable conditions for dehydration. This characteristic strongly contributes to the potential of SBLE to become a 'green' tool in industrial applications. Indeed, lactonization occurs normally in organic solvents, an application for which microbial lipases are increasingly used as biocatalysts. Previously, we described the production of recombinant SBLE (rSBLE) in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii). However, expression was not optimal to delve deeper into the enzyme's potential for industrial application. In the current study, we explored codon-optimization of the SBLE gene and we optimized the rSBLE expression protocol. Temperature reduction had the biggest impact followed by codon-optimization and co-expression of the HAC1 transcription factor. Combining these approaches, we achieved a 32-fold improvement of the yield during rSBLE production (from 0.75 mg/l to 24 mg/L culture) accompanied with a strong reduction of contaminants after affinity purification.</p></details><hr><h4>Furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural degradation using recombinant manganese peroxidase.</h4><p>K. L. Yee et al., Enzyme Microb Technol 108 59 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108628>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Biomass pretreatment-derived degradation compounds, such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF), inhibit the growth of fermentation microorganisms that utilize biomass to produce fuels and chemicals. Here we report that recombinant manganese peroxidase (rMnP) produced from the yeast Pichia pastoris can degrade furfural and HMF making them less toxic to microorganisms. Treatment with rMnP or manganese(III) acetate reduced furfural and HMF concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Furfural disappearance was accompanied by malonate disappearance and accumulation of four distinct degradation products. Furfural was more readily degraded by rMnP and manganese(III) acetate than HMF. Growth assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that rMnP treatment reduced the toxicity of furfural and HMF. This work provides an avenue to use rMnP to increase the growth of fermentation microorganisms that are inhibited by toxic compounds derived from pretreatment of biomass.</p></details><hr><h4>A novel engineered interchain disulfide bond in the constant region enhances the thermostability of adalimumab Fab.</h4><p>H. Nakamura, N. Oda-Ueda, T. Ueda, T. Ohkuri, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 495 7 (2018).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097200>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We constructed a system for expressing the Fab of the therapeutic human monoclonal antibody adalimumab at a yield of 20 mg/L in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. To examine the contribution of interchain disulfide bonds to conformational stability, we prepared adalimumab Fab from which the interchain disulfide bond at the C-terminal region at both the CH1 and CL domains was deleted by substitution of Cys with Ala (FabDeltaSS). DSC measurements showed that the Tm values of FabDeltaSS were approximately 5 degrees C lower than those of wild-type Fab, suggesting that the interchain disulfide bond contributes to conformational thermostability. Using computer simulations, we designed a novel interchain disulfide bond outside the C-terminal region to increase the stability of FabDeltaSS. The resulting Fab (mutSS FabDeltaSS) had the mutations</p><p><strong> H:</strong>V177C and</p><p><strong> L:</strong>Q160C in FabDeltaSS, confirming the formation of the disulfide bond between CH1 and CL. The thermostability of mutSS FabDeltaSS was approximately 5 degrees C higher than that of FabDeltaSS. Therefore, the introduction of the designed interchain disulfide bond enhanced the thermostability of FabDeltaSS and mitigated the destabilization caused by partial reduction of the interchain disulfide bond at the C-terminal region, which occurs in site-specific modification such as PEGylation.</p></details><hr><h4>Integrated Bottom-Up and Top-Down Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for Characterization of Recombinant Human Growth Hormone Degradation Products.</h4><p>Y. A. Wang et al., Anal Chem 89 12771 (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29096433>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>With the advent of biosimilars to the U.S. market, it is important to have better analytical tools to ensure product quality from batch to batch. In addition, the recent popularity of using a continuous process for production of biopharmaceuticals, the traditional bottom-up method, alone for product characterization and quality analysis is no longer sufficient. Bottom-up method requires large amounts of material for analysis and is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Additionally, in this analysis, digestion of the protein with enzymes such as trypsin could induce artifacts and modifications which would increase the complexity of the analysis. On the other hand, a top-down method requires a minimum amount of sample and allows for analysis of the intact protein mass and sequence generated from fragmentation within the instrument. However, fragmentation usually occurs at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein with less internal fragmentation. Herein, we combine the use of the complementary techniques, a top-down and bottom-up method, for the characterization of human growth hormone degradation products. Notably, our approach required small amounts of sample, which is a requirement due to the sample constraints of small scale manufacturing. Using this approach, we were able to characterize various protein variants, including post-translational modifications such as oxidation and deamidation, residual leader sequence, and proteolytic cleavage. Thus, we were able to highlight the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches, which achieved the characterization of a wide range of product variants in samples of human growth hormone secreted from Pichia pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Transcriptional analysis of impacts of glycerol transporter 1 on methanol and glycerol metabolism in Pichia pastoris.</h4><p>X. Li et al., FEMS Yeast Res   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29092019>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The efficient promoter of alcohol oxidase 1 (PAOX1) in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is strictly induced by methanol but repressed by glycerol with an unclear molecular mechanism. In the present study, the gene of a previously characterized transmembrane protein glycerol transporter 1 (GT1) of P. pastoris GS115 was deleted by homologous recombination. Transcriptional profiles of the mutant (gt1 big up tri, open) and wild-type (WT) were compared with different carbon sources (glycerol, methanol, and glycerol-methanol mix) at various time points using high-throughput RNA-Seq techniques. We determined that the loss of glycerol transporter 1 (Gt1p) could relieve catabolite repression in the glycerol-methanol mixed medium and shared a similar transcriptional profile with the WT in methanol medium. By calculating the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in three distinct paired groups, genes involved in the stress response, nutrition deprivation, and translational process were identified, explaining the potential roles of glycerol in the regulation of methanol metabolism. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), the relationship between biological traits and the transcriptional profile was established. With the support of published research and our data, we propose two possible regulatory pathways that are involved in the regulation of catabolite repression (AMPK/SNF1 and MAPK/HOG), thereby providing potential targets for both research and industrial strain improvement.</p></details><hr><h4>Expanding the CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit for Pichia pastoris with efficient donor integration and alternative resistance markers.</h4><p>A. Weninger et al., J Cell Biochem   (2017).</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29091307>pubmed link</a></p><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris) is one of the most commonly used host systems for recombinant protein expression. Achieving targeted genetic modifications had been hindered by low frequencies of homologous recombination (HR). Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has been implemented for P. pastoris enabling gene knockouts based on indels (insertion, deletions) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at near 100% efficiency. However, specifically integrating homologous donor cassettes via HR for replacement studies had proven difficult resulting at most in approximately 20% correct integration using CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we demonstrate the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated integration of markerless donor cassettes at efficiencies approaching 100% using a ku70 deletion strain. The Ku70p is involved in NHEJ repair and lack of the protein appears to favor repair via HR near exclusively. While the absolute number of transformants in the Deltaku70 strain is reduced, virtually all surviving transformants showed correct integration. In the wildtype strain, markerless donor cassette integration was also improved up to 25-fold by placing an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) on the donor cassette. Alternative strategies for improving donor cassette integration using a Cas9 nickase variant or reducing off targeting associated toxicity using a high fidelity Cas9 variant were so far not successful in our hands in P. pastoris. Furthermore we provide Cas9/gRNA expression plasmids with a Geneticin resistance marker which proved to be versatile tools for marker recycling. The reported CRSIPR-Cas9 tools can be applied for modifying existing production strains and also pave the way for markerless whole genome modification studies in P. pastoris.</p></details><hr><h4>Heterologous expression of two minor laccase isozyme cDNAs from the edible mushroom Grifola frondosa.</h4><p>T.
