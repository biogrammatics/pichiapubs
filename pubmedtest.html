Drugs are useful against hookworm infections, but hookworms rapidly reinfect people, and the parasites can develop drug resistance. Therefore, having a hookworm vaccine would be of tremendous benefit. METHODOLOGY/</p><p><strong>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:</strong> We investigated the vaccine efficacy in outbred Syrian hamsters of three A. ceylanicum hookworm antigen candidates from two classes of proteins previously identified as promising vaccine candidates. These include two intestinally-enriched, putatively secreted cathepsin B cysteine proteases (AceyCP1, AceyCPL) and one small Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (AceySKPI3). Recombinant proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris, and adsorbed to Alhydrogel. Recombinant AceyCPL (rAceyCPL)/Alhydrogel and rAceySKPI3/Alhydrogel induced high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in 8/8 vaccinates, but were not protective. rAceyCP1/Alhydrogel induced intermediate serum IgG titers in ~60% of vaccinates in two different trials. rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had highly significantly decreased hookworm burdens, fecal egg counts and clinical pathology compared to Alhydrogel controls and nonresponders. Protection was highly correlated with rAceyCP1 serum IgG titer. Antisera from rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders, but not nonresponders or rAceyCPL/Alhydrogel vaccinates, significantly reduced adult A. ceylanicum motility in vitro. Furthermore, rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had canonical Th2-specific recall responses (IL4, IL5, IL13) in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo. CONCLUSIONS/</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> These findings indicate that rAceyCP1 is a promising vaccine candidate and validates a genomic/transcriptomic approach to human hookworm vaccine discovery.</p></details></div>

In yeasts, pexophagy depends mostly on the pexophagy receptors, such as Atg30 for Pichia pastoris and Atg36 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the autophagy scaffold proteins, Atg11 and Atg17, and the core autophagy machinery. In P. pastoris, the receptors for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) include the PTS1 receptor, Pex5, and the PTS2 receptor and co-receptor, Pex7 and Pex20, respectively. These shuttling receptors are predominantly cytosolic and only partially peroxisomal. It remains unresolved as to whether, when and how the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal receptors, as well as the peroxisomal matrix proteins, are degraded under pexophagy conditions. These cytosolic pools exist both in normal and mutant cells impaired in peroxisome biogenesis. We report here that Pex5 and Pex7, but not Pex20, are degraded by an Atg30-independent, selective autophagy pathway. To enter this selective autophagy pathway, Pex7 required its major PTS2 cargo, Pot1. Similarly, the degradation of Pex5 was inhibited in cells missing abundant PTS1 cargoes, such as alcohol oxidases and Fox2 (hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase). Furthermore, in cells deficient in PTS receptors, the cytosolic pools of peroxisomal matrix proteins, such as Pot1 and Fox2, were also removed by Atg30-independent, selective autophagy, under pexophagy conditions. In summary, the cytosolic pools of PTS receptors and their cargoes are degraded via a pexophagy-independent, selective autophagy pathway under pexophagy conditions. These autophagy pathways likely protect cells from futile enzymatic reactions that could potentially cause the accumulation of toxic cytosolic products.

In this study, microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris strain GS115, and the enzyme activity was approximately 0.70U/ml. The recombinant MTG expressed in P. pastoris was used in the investigation of restructured pork and crosslinking of soy protein isolate (SPI) and chicken myofibrillar protein (MP). Results showed that the hardness, chewiness, and F1 of the restructured pork increased, and the adhesiveness decreased after MTG treatment, However, high temperature had greater effect on the texture of restructured pork after MTG treatment than that of the control. MTG can crosslink SPI component acidic subunits, subunits of beta-conglycinin and MP component myosin heavy chain, and actin. MTG, as a food additive, can be successfully heterologously expressed, and the recombinant MTG has potential application in restructured meat products.</p></details></div>

Two laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes were identified in the genome of M. importuna SCYDJ1-A1 as putative laccase-encoding genes. The two genes, belonging to Auxiliary Activity family 1 subfamily 3, were named as MiLacA and MiLacB. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino acid sequences showed that MiLacA is closest to a LMCO of M. importuna 22J1, while MiLacB had low similarity with known Morchella LMCOs. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that MiLacA was expressed at much higher levels than MiLacB throughout the entire course of artificial cultivation. MiLacA was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris as a recombinant protein. Biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme showed that MiLacA simultaneously possessed laccase and polyphenol-oxidase activities. MiLacA could be strongly inhibited by Fe(2+), which is unusual. The optimum pH was four and optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. The enzyme retained over 74% of the laccase activity after 16-h incubation at 60 degrees C, which means that its thermostability is at the forefront among the currently known laccases. Our findings may help to elucidate how the laccase of M. importuna is involved in decaying lignin in plant litter, and could also provide a candidate thermostable laccase for potential industrial application.</p></details></div>

Herein, two distinct A2M genes (designated as PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2, respectively) were isolated from the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 encoded proteins with 1541 or 1516 amino acids, respectively, containing the typically functional domains of A2M. Unlike highly expressed in hemocytes of most arthropods, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 were predominantly detected in gill, eyestalk and digestive tracks. During the embryonic stages, PtA2Ms were found to be expressed most highly in fertilized eggs, suggesting their maternal origin. After challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, the transcripts of PtA2Ms showed similar time-dependent response expression pattern, while PtA2M-1 was more sensitive to Micrococcus luteus and Pichia pastoris infection than PtA2M-2. Knockdown of PtA2M-1 or PtA2M-2 could significantly enhance the expression of prophenoloxidase (proPO) associated genes (PtproPO and PtPPAF) and serine protease related genes (PtcSP1-3 and PtSPH), however, PtLSZ and the phagocytosis-related genes (PtMyosin and PtRab5) were effectively inhibited. These results were further supported by the PO and lysozyme activities in hemolymph of the PtA2M-1- or PtA2M-2-silenced crabs. In addition, PtA2M-1 and PtA2M-2 could regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (PtALF1-3, PtCrustin1 and PtCrustin3) through the Toll and NF-kappaB pathways. Our findings together suggest that PtA2Ms might function in crab host defense via regulating the proPO system, phagocytosis and the expression of AMP genes.</p></details></div>

Co-cultures did not affect endothelial cell morphology or viability. Additionally, P. pastoris was induced to express enhanced green fluorescence protein when co-cultured with human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 under mammalian cell culture conditions.

This study focused on identifying the removal of two widely-used pesticides isoproturon (IPU) and acetochlor (ACT) by a genetically developed paddy (or rice) plant overexpressing an uncharacterized glycosyltransferase (IRGT1). IRGT1 conferred plant resistance to isoproturon/acetochlor, which was manifested by attenuated cellular injure and alleviated toxicity of rice growth under isoproturon/acetochlor stress. A short-term study showed that IRGT1-transformed lines removed 33.3-48.3% and 39.8-53.5% from the growth medium and remained only 59.5-72.1% and 58.9-70.4% isoproturon and acetochlor in plants compared to untransformed rice, respectively. This phenotype was well confirmed by IRGT1-expression in yeast (Pichia pastoris) which grew better and contained less isoproturon/acetochlor than control cells. A long-term study showed that isoproturon/acetochlor concentrations at all developmental stages were significantly lower in the transformed rice containing only 59.3-69.2% (isoproturon) and 51.7-57.4% (acetochlor) of those in wild-type. In contrast, UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that more isoproturon/acetochlor metabolites were detected in the transformed rice. Sixteen metabolites of isoproturon (19 for acetochlor) for Phase I reaction and 9 isoproturon conjugates (13 for acetochlor) for Phase II reaction in rice were characterized, of which 7 isoproturon and 6 isoproturon metabolites or conjugates were reported in plants for the first time.</p></details></div>

Exploration of alternatives production systems like as extracellular expression in microorganisms generally recognized as safe (such as Pichia pastoris Glycoswitch((R))) could be advantageous, in particular, if this system is able to produce homogeneous glycosylation. Here, we evaluated extracellular expression into Glycoswitch((R)) using two different strains constructions containing the asnB gene coding for Erwinia chrysanthemi L-ASNase (with and without His-tag), in order to find the best system for producing the extracellular and biologically active protein. When the His-tag was absent, both cell expression and protein secretion processes were considerably improved. Three-dimensional modeling of the protein suggests that additional structures (His-tag) could adversely affect native conformation and folding from L-ASNase and therefore the expression and cell secretion of this enzyme.</p></details></div>

The phospholipase D-mediated green synthesis of phosphatidylserine has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In this study, the phospholipase D was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. The highest activity of phospholipase D was observed in C. glutamicum, which was 0.25 U/mL higher than these in B. subtilis (0.14 U/mL) and P. pastoris (0.22 U/mL). System engineering of three potential factors, including (1) signal peptides, (2) ribosome binding site, and (3) promoters, was attempted to improve the expression level of phospholipase D in C. glutamicum. The maximum phospholipase D activity reached 1.9 U/mL, which was 7.6-fold higher than that of the initial level. The enzyme displayed favorable transphosphatidylation activity and it could efficiently catalyze the substrates L-serine and soybean lecithin for synthesis of phosphatidylserine after optimizing the conversion reactions in detail. Under the optimum conditions (trichloromethane/enzyme solution 4:2, 8 mg/mL soybean lecithin, 40 mg/mL L-serine, and 15 mM CaCl2, with shaking under 40 degrees C for 10 h), the reaction process showed 48.6% of conversion rate and 1.94 g/L of accumulated phosphatidylserine concentration. The results highlight the use of heterologous expression, system engineering, and process optimization strategies to adapt a promising phospholipase D for efficient phosphatidylserine production in synthetic application.</p></details></div>

In this study, the glycoside hydrolase family 45 (GH45) subfamily B endoglucanase EG27II from the snail Ampullaria crossean was expressed using a Pichia pastoris expression system and the crystal structure of the apo form was determined at 1.00 A resolution; this is the highest resolution structure of an animal endoglucanase. The results showed that EG27II has a double-psi six-stranded beta-barrel and that the structure of EG27II more closely resembles those of subfamily C enzymes than those of subfamily A enzymes. The structure of EG27II complexed with cellobiose was also determined under cryoconditions and at room temperature at three pH values, pH 4.0, 5.5 and 8.0, and no structural changes were found to be associated with the change in pH. The structural comparison and catalytic activity measurements showed that Asp137 and Asn112 function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively, and that Asp27 is also an important residue for catalysis. These high-resolution structures of EG27II provide a large amount of information for structure-based enzyme modification and cell-surface engineering, which will advance biofuel production using animal-derived cellulases.</p></details></div>

The expressed bovine IL-15 was purified by anion exchange chromatography and further characterized using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Biological activity of the purified protein was evaluated in vitro through induction of Bcl2 in IL-15 stimulated PBMCs was measured using qPCR and the phosphorylation of STAT3 was confirmed by immuno-staining of HEK273 cells. From the recent research studies, it was evident that the fatty acid oxidation catalyzed by Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1a (Cpt1a) is a critical step during the conversion of effector CD8(+) T cells to memory CD8(+) T cells which is induced by IL-15. There were no research studies revealed the role of IL-15 on activating memory CD8(+) T cells by influencing the Cpt1a in Bovines was documented; yet and in the present study, we evaluated that bovine IL-15 could induce the expression of Cpt1a in IL-15 treated bovine PBMCs and helps in memory cell induction.</p></details></div>

Thus, they can act on water-insoluble carboxylic esters releasing long-chain fatty acids but also on sterol esters, although with different activity and affinity. The differences in the catalytic properties among the proteins of this family are explained by small changes in the hydrophobicity of some regions. One of such versatile enzymes is the sterol esterase/lipase from Ophiostoma piceae (OPE) that acts very efficiently on the two types of substrates. Structurally, OPE is characterized by the presence of a lid formed by a alpha-helix and two 310-helices rich in hydrophobic amino acids. In this study, the ope gene was modified by directed mutagenesis in order to change specific amino acids in the lid region to modify its structure with the aim of increasing its hydrophobicity. Several recombinant forms of OPE were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. In silico molecular dynamics simulations have been used to decipher the mechanistic principles behind the improvements in substrate catalysis. The analyses suggested that the enhanced activity toward hydrophobic substrates such as triglycerides could be due to a better stabilization of the substrate in the lid region as a result of an increased hydrophobicity and an improved topology. These results indicate that in silico simulations can be useful for the optimization of the activity of lipases from the C. rugose-like family for different biotechnological applications.</p></details></div>
